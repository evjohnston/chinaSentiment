Bush,Republican,George Tenet,Director of Central Intelligence (DCI),"Annual Report to Congress on the Safety and Security of Russian Nuclear Facilities and Military Forces February Scope Note Congress has directed the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to submit to the Congressional leadership and intelligence committees an annual, unclassified report assessing the safety and security of the nuclear facilities and military forces in Russia. Congress further asked that each report include a discussion of the following: The ability of the Russian Government to maintain its nuclear military forces. The security arrangements at Russia s civilian and military nuclear facilities. The reliability of controls and safety systems at Russia s civilian nuclear facilities. The reliability of command and control systems and procedures of the nuclear military forces in Russia. This annual report is the third responding to this Congressional request. The report addresses facilities and forces of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Atomic Energy, and other Russian institutes. It updates the September report to Congress. This paper has been prepared under the auspices of the National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear Programs. Key Points Annual Report to Congress on the Safety and Security of Russian Nuclear Facilities and Military Forces Moscow will continue to devote scarce resources to maintaining its nuclear forces. Nevertheless, the aging of Russia's strategic systems and Putin's military reform plan to shift resources to the general purpose forces probably will result in Russia having fewer than , strategic warheads by . Even with ongoing reductions, Moscow probably will retain several thousand nonstrategic nuclear warheads in its inventory because of concerns over its deteriorating conventional capabilities. Russia employs physical, procedural, and technical measures to secure its weapons against an external threat, but many of these measures date from the Soviet era and are not designed to counter the pre-eminent threat faced today an insider who attempts unauthorized actions. Moscow has maintained adequate security and control of its nuclear weapons, but a decline in military funding has stressed the nuclear security system. An unauthorized launch or accidental use of a Russian nuclear weapon is highly unlikely as long as current technical and procedural safeguards built into the command and control system remain in place and are effectively enforced. Our concerns about possible circumvention of the system would rise if central political authority broke down. Security varies widely among the different types of Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) facilities and other Russian institutes. Russian facilities housing weapons-usable nuclear material uranium enriched to percent or greater in uranium- or uranium- isotopes and any plutonium containing less than percent of the isotope plutonium- typically receive low funding, lack trained security personnel, and do not have sufficient equipment for securely storing such material. Weapons-grade and weapons-usable nuclear materials have been stolen from some Russian institutes. We assess that undetected smuggling has occurred, although we do not know the extent or magnitude of such thefts. Nevertheless, we are concerned about the total amount of material that could have been diverted over the last years. In , . kilograms of -percent-enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen from the Luch Production Association. In , . kilograms of -percent-enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen in Moscow. In , we confirmed that nuclear material seized in Bulgaria was weapons-usable. The material four grams of highly enriched uranium likely originated in Russia. Although not independently confirmed, reports of a theft in from an unnamed enterprise in Chelyabinsk Oblast are of concern. According to Viktor Yerastov, chief of Minatom's Nuclear Materials Accounting and Control Department, the amount stolen was ""quite sufficient material to produce an atomic bomb"" the only nuclear theft that has been so described. Over the last six years, Moscow has recognized the need for security improvements and, with assistance from the United States and other countries, has taken steps to reduce the risk of theft. On their own initiative in , , and in mid-summer , Russian authorities ordered increased security at nuclear facilities due to concerns about a reported increased terrorist threat as a result of Moscow s campaign in Chechnya, according to official statements and media reporting. Since the September terrorist attacks in the United States, Russian officials, including President Putin, have conducted a public campaign to provide assurances that terrorists have not acquired Russian nuclear weapons. Through the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the US Department of Energy s Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, the United States continues to assist Russia in improving security at nuclear facilities. Russia s nuclear security has been slowly improving over the last several years, but risks remain. Russia has announced plans to more than double its capacity to generate nuclear power over the next years and to begin construction of reactors with enhanced safety features. Since July , Russian media have reported increased security measures at a number of nuclear power plants. Even with increased security measures, however, such plants almost certainly will remain vulnerable to a well-planned and executed terrorist attack. After the September terrorist attacks in the United States, Minister of Atomic Energy Rumyantsev reported that Russian nuclear power facilities are protected by special guards patrolling around the clock in addition to national defense forces. An official of Rosenergoatom reported on September that security services at the nuclear power plants already were working a harsh regime because of the continuing military actions in Chechnya and that additional security measures were not necessary. Discussion Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the security environment surrounding nuclear weapons and materials in Russia has changed radically. Security measures in both the Ministries of Defense (MOD) and Atomic Energy (Minatom) during the Soviet era were aimed at preventing the external or outsider threat; it was virtually unthinkable that an insider would attempt to steal a nuclear weapon or nuclear material. In contrast, the deterioration of the Russian economy, state security apparatus, and military has resulted in an entirely new security environment one in which concern about an insider threat predominates. The Russians have reacted to this new threat by instituting some new security procedures at their nuclear facilities, including instituting polygraph examinations. Over the last three years, we have seen Moscow elevate its concern about the security of its nuclear weapons and materials. Russian authorities ordered increased security due to concerns over a growing terrorist threat resulting from Moscow s campaign in Chechnya, according to official statements and media reporting. In November , the Russian Government instructed Minatom and other federal executive agencies to implement additional measures to step up the physical security of nuclear installations, including modernizing security systems. Minatom along with the MOD, the Federal Security Service, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs was to evaluate external and internal threats to nuclear installations and develop physical security enhancements. In addition, immediately following the September terrorist attacks in the United States, Russian President Putin called for the Russian military and security services to heighten security, according to Russian media. The United States is working cooperatively with Moscow to increase the safety and security of nuclear-related facilities, infrastructure, and personnel. The Russian MOD is responsible for the nuclear military forces and its nuclear weapons storage system. Minatom operates the national nuclear weapons complex, conducts weapons- related tests at the MOD s nuclear test site, and controls most nuclear-related institutes and industrial facilities. Minatom and Rosenergoatom operate Russia s nuclear power reactors. The US Department of Defense, through the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program, is assisting MOD and Minatom. The US Department of Energy, through the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) Program, exchanges between the US national laboratories and Russian components, and the Nuclear Cities Initiative, is providing security assistance to Minatom; Rosenergoatom; the Russian Navy; Gosatomnadzor (GAN); and the Ministries of Interior, Education, and Economy. Ministry of Defense Nuclear Weapons Inventory Moscow currently maintains fewer than , operational strategic nuclear warheads in its strategic nuclear triad, which is composed of ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers carrying nuclear-tipped air-launched cruise missiles. Despite the emphasis on nuclear weapons as Russia s primary means of deterrence, Russian strategic nuclear forces are subject to the same significant budget constraints affecting other portions of the government. The strategic forces will face additional budget cuts, resulting in lower strategic warhead levels, because Putin s military reform plan will shift resources to the general purpose forces. Nevertheless, Moscow continues to devote scarce resources to maintaining and modernizing its forces. Russian officials have claimed publicly that the harsh economic realities and aging of strategic systems will drive their strategic forces down to fewer than , warheads. Russia has increased efforts in recent years to extend the service lives of most strategic systems in order to maintain as many warheads as possible. Until recently, one of Russia s highest military priorities has been the deployment of its most modern ICBM, the SS- /Topol -M. Twenty single-warhead SS- s were deployed by the end of . Russia planned to deploy ten additional missiles by the end of , but only half were deployed. Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov said last October that Russia would deploy a minimum of six missiles annually over the next decade. Nuclear Warhead Security The Russians have maintained security and control of their nuclear warheads and weapons, although the economic crisis of the s and the consequent decline in military funding have stressed the country s nuclear security system. Russia currently uses essentially the same nuclear command and control system built by the Soviet Union, whose military and political leaders concerned about the possibility of an unauthorized launch built a highly centralized system with technical and procedural safeguards. We judge that an unauthorized launch or accidental use of a Russian nuclear weapon is highly unlikely as long as those safeguards remain in place. A breakdown of central political authority, however, would raise our concerns about possible circumvention of the system. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow has consolidated all nuclear weapons of the former Soviet stockpile into storage sites in Russia. We assess that by June , the last of the former Soviet tactical nuclear warheads were withdrawn to Russia, and that by the end of , the last of the strategic nuclear warheads had been removed from Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Russian officials have stated that thousands of nuclear warheads from the former Soviet stockpile have been dismantled since ; reportedly over , warheads have been eliminated. Bilateral agreements between Ukraine and Russia called for the elimination of some , nuclear warheads both nonstrategic and strategic that were once stored on the territory of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials reportedly monitored the disassembly of these nuclear warheads at the Russian dismantlement facilities. Press reports indicate that the Ukrainian nuclear warheads were eliminated by . Moscow is significantly reducing its nonstrategic nuclear stockpile. In October , then-Soviet President Gorbachev, responding to a US presidential initiative, announced that the Soviet Union would unilaterally consolidate most of its nonstrategic nuclear warheads in central depots and would eliminate a major portion of them. In January , President Yel'tsin publicly reaffirmed Gorbachev s announcement. Although Russia has taken some actions to fulfill these pledges, Moscow because of concerns over deteriorating conventional capabilities probably will retain several thousand nonstrategic nuclear warheads through at least . Physical Security. To secure their weapons, the Russians employ a multi-layered approach that includes physical, procedural, and technical measures. The security system was designed in the Soviet era to protect weapons primarily against a threat from outside the country and may not be sufficient to meet today s challenge of a knowledgeable insider collaborating with a criminal or terrorist group. General-Colonel Igor Valynkin, chief of the th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense ( th GUMO) the organization responsible for warhead storage, maintenance, and logistics stated in August that there have been no incidents of attempted theft, seizure, or unauthorized actions involving nuclear weapons. Since the September terrorist attacks in the United States, President Putin and Valynkin have conducted a public campaign to provide assurances that terrorists have not acquired Russian nuclear weapons. Valynkin announced on October that security had been stepped up at Russian nuclear weapons storage sites since the attacks on the United States. He also noted that security had been heightened earlier in the year after Russian authorities had twice thwarted terrorist efforts to reconnoiter nuclear weapons storage sites. Valynkin stated that none of the terrorists entered the nuclear weapons sites. At a subsequent press conference on October, Valynkin was adamant that no Russian nuclear weapons had been stolen and described such allegations as barking mad. He reiterated that nuclear warhead personnel are subject to psychological, lie detector, drug, and alcohol testing. In a November interview, President Putin said he was absolutely confident that terrorists in Afghanistan do not have Soviet or Russian weapons of mass destruction. Over the last six years, Moscow has recognized the need for security improvements and, with US assistance, has taken steps to reduce the risk of theft. We judge that nuclear security would improve over time if Russia routinely implemented security upgrades and procedures under US- funded threat reduction programs. Some of the key US-funded security upgrade programs include: Perimeter security upgrades around nuclear storage sites, including fences, sensors, and alarms. Computers to automate the warhead inventory management system. Transportation upgrades to railcars and the provision of supercontainers and Kevlar blankets for shipment of warheads to increase their protection from small- arms fire. Training and equipment for Emergency Response Teams for nuclear accidents. Valynkin has admitted that a lack of domestic funding has made Russia dependent on foreign assistance for physical security upgrades. Quoting Valynkin, an August press report stated that the United States is financing the procurement of security systems for the MOD. The newspaper also described Valynkin as troubled because only a third of the new equipment had been put into service due to funding shortages. Despite the lack of funds, however, the chief of the MOD s Special Construction Troops reported in December that security enhancements were being completed at dozens of nuclear facilities. Even with the enhancements, security problems may still exist at the nuclear weapons storage sites. In August , an anonymous military officer claimed in a Russian television program interview that security was lax at th GUMO sites. The officer outlined a number of problems at the storage sites, including charges that there are personnel shortages and that alarms systems operate only percent of the time. The officer speculated that a terrorist organization could seize a nuclear warhead. Personnel Reliability. Much like other parts of the military, the Strategic Rocket Forces and the th GUMO have also suffered from wage arrears as well as shortages of food and housing allowances. In , the th GUMO closed a nuclear weapons storage site due to hunger strikes by the workers; in , families of several nuclear units protested over wage and benefit arrears. According to Russian press, the MOD addressed most of the arrears by early , and wages are now paid regularly. Even when paid, however, officers wages rarely exceed $ a month and wives cannot earn a second income because the storage sites are usually located far from cities, according to the anonymous th GUMO officer. Housing for th GUMO personnel is of poor quality or nonexistent. According to the Chief of Staff of the th GUMO, there are , homeless active duty and retired officers. The poor living conditions of the officers who contend with lack of heating, leaky plumbing, and deteriorating buildings have been reported by Russian press. Moscow has acknowledged the potential vulnerability of its nuclear security personnel. In October , General Valynkin referenced serious incidents that had occurred at some of his subordinate facilities and stated that more stringent selection criteria for nuclear warhead personnel would be used. Speaking at a press conference concerning US CTR funding in February , Valynkin acknowledged, the greatest problem is the person who works with nuclear warheads. He knows the secrets, he has the access, he knows the security system. Valynkin emphasized that personnel are thoroughly screened for links to the crime world and for their suitability to work with warheads. He added that the th GUMO would be using US CTR-provided polygraph equipment and drug and alcohol tests to monitor the reliability of its personnel. In May , Valynkin stated that two students at the th GUMO s Security Assessment Training Center were expelled as a result of the drug tests. Valynkin also reported in May that the MOD is changing warhead transport security operations by using officers rather than enlisted personnel because across the entire MOD, during that month alone, seven sentries had left their posts. Ministry of Atomic Energy Nuclear Materials Security Russian officials recognize the need to improve the security of weapons-usable nuclear materials that we assess are stored in over buildings at over facilities across the country. After a cabinet meeting on the topic in September , Prime Minister Kasyanov stated publicly that protection of fissile materials varies from place to place and that in some cases the material is endangered. At the same press conference, a Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy noted that reported attempts to steal fissile materials had dropped significantly in recent years. He said that whereas there were such reports from to , there were only two from to . The Deputy Minister also criticized Western press reports for exaggerating the problem. Minatom officials provided no details about the incidents and have not subsequently provided updated data for and . There have been, however, a number of press reports about materials seized in Russia about which we have no further information because Russia typically does not reveal the results of its investigations. Press reports, in fact, generally overstate the impact of stolen material, often referring to or implying that depleted, natural, or low- enriched uranium are weapons-grade or weapons-usable material. Weapons-usable material is defined as uranium enriched to percent or greater in the uranium- or uranium- isotopes (highly enriched uranium HEU) and any plutonium containing less than percent of the isotope plutonium- . Weapons-grade material is typically defined as uranium enriched to greater than percent uranium- or uranium- , or plutonium- containing less than percent plutonium- . Russian institutes have lost weapons-grade and weapons-usable nuclear materials in thefts. In , . kilograms of -percent- enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen from the Luch Production Association. In , . kilograms of -percent- enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen in Moscow. In , we confirmed that a Bulgarian seizure of nuclear material was weapons- usable. The material four grams of HEU likely originated in Russia. In contrast, non-weapons-grade nuclear material thefts, particularly containers of radionuclides such as cesium- or strontium- , have been frequent and well documented. Terrorists could use these radionuclides to build a radiological dispersal device (RDD). An RDD is defined as a device designed to disperse radioactive material to cause injury and contamination by means of the radiation. Reportedly, Chechen terrorists placed a container holding a small amount of cesium- in a Moscow Park in November . Remarking on this event, General Dudayev, the former leader of the Chechen independence movement, stated ""[this] is just a scant portion of the radioactive substances which we have at our disposal."" Although not independently confirmed, reports of a theft in from an unnamed enterprise in Chelyabinsk Oblast are of concern. According to Viktor Yerastov, chief of Minatom's Nuclear Materials Accounting and Control Department, the amount stolen was ""quite sufficient material to produce an atomic bomb"" the only nuclear theft that has been so described. The reduction in seizures of stolen material and in reported theft attempts may be due to several factors: US assistance to improve security at Russian facilities, a possible decrease in smuggling, or smugglers becoming more knowledgeable about evading detection. We assess that undetected smuggling has occurred, although we do not know the extent or magnitude of undetected thefts. Nevertheless, we are concerned about the total amount of material that could have been diverted over the last years. Efforts To Improve Physical Security and Safeguards. Prior to DOE assistance to enhance safeguards and security, Russian MPC&A practices did not meet internationally accepted standards. Russian facilities housing nuclear materials typically receive low funding, lack trained security personnel, and do not have sufficient equipment for securely storing nuclear materials. The DOE-administered MPC&A program, as well as other programs, is assisting the former Soviet states to upgrade safeguards (accountability and control) over nuclear materials and physical security at a wide range of nuclear facilities. For example: A US-funded computer system to handle inventory reporting to Minatom headquarters began to come on-line at pilot facilities in mid- and will require officials to track materials closely to better assure timely detection in the event of a loss or diversion. The US Department of Defense is helping Russia to build a state-of-the-art storage facility for long-term secure storage of plutonium and HEU from dismantled nuclear weapons. Russia and the United States have broadened their cooperative work to include securing Russian Navy highly enriched uranium reactor fuel at three naval land-based storage sites. The United States is purchasing MT of HEU $ billion over a -year period which Russia is blending down into low-enriched uranium suitable for use in nuclear power reactors. A new DOE/Minatom effort seeks to convert highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium under the MPC&A Program s Material Consolidation and Conversion initiative. DOE has implemented a sustainability program to assist with maintenance, training, and operation of the upgraded physical security systems in response to Russian budgetary problems and potential neglect of equipment. In mid- DOE reported that by the end of FY ""comprehensive"" security upgrades would have expanded to cover an estimated percent of Russia s weapons-usable nuclear material, and that if facilities protected by rapid upgrades were added, the percentage would increase to . When Rapid upgrades include items such as baseline item inventories, locks, delay blocks, steel cages, limiting access, and hardening windows. Comprehensive upgrades include rapid upgrades plus detection systems, closed-circuit television monitoring and the upgrades currently underway are completed, the portion of material with improved security will increase to approximately percent. Progress is most advanced at civilian institutes and Russian Navy sites, and lags at Minatom facilities within the nuclear weapons complex which contain most of the material of proliferation interest because Russian security concerns prevent direct US access to sensitive materials. The progress at civilian and naval sites addresses key vulnerabilities because seizures involving HEU and separated plutonium have been linked to these locations rather than nuclear weapons assembly/disassembly plants. Russia s nuclear MPC&A has been slowly improving over the last several years, but risks remain. Economics and Personnel Reliability. Even after technical modernization, security for weapons-usable nuclear material depends largely on the diligence, competence, and morale of personnel who monitor systems and guard material and facilities and on managers who must emphasize security over production. Programs to improve physical security, accountability, and training could be undermined by disgruntled Russian personnel or unreceptive managers and employees. Because of improvements in the national economy, Russia and Minatom are now able to pay personnel on time. Thus, for now, compensation and benefits appear adequate, and personnel no longer face the financial pressures of the late s that might have led some to permit or actively participate in weapons-usable nuclear material theft. assessment systems, material measurement equipment, and computerized accounting systems. Convenience and pressure to produce also can contribute to lapses in security. US Government Accounting Office auditors noted in their February report that, at one facility, a gate in a fence emplaced with US aid around a weapons-usable nuclear material storage building was routinely left open and unguarded during the day. Russian officials explained that it was simply too much trouble for the employees to open and close the combination lock repeatedly as they entered and left the building. This practice, however, undermined control of access and meant that the only security measures in effect were the perimeter fence and guards at the facility. Safety at Russian Nuclear Material Processing Facilities Russian HEU facilities have at least three levels of contamination control. Level one denotes an area of essentially no contamination. Level two denotes an area of lower contamination where personnel are required to wear protective clothing and masks, but extensive monitoring is not required. Such areas include oxide purification, calcining, container storage, and fluorination. Level three denotes an area of high contamination that requires protective clothing and masks, and requires extensive monitoring to reduce the spread of contamination. Such areas include metal machining and oxidation. The monitoring of personnel radiation safety is also a multi-layered process. Workers and visitors are required to wear the standard Russian particulate control mask while in nuclear facilities. In addition, shoes and protective clothing (hats, gloves, lab coats, and in the chemical metallurgical areas full body protective clothing) are provided. Radiation dosimeters are available and generally are used by Russians and visitors to their plants. Radiation- monitoring devices mounted along the walls are present in areas of HEU operations, along with air-sampling ports. Personnel and visitors are required to wash their hands when leaving contaminated areas; then both hands and feet are checked by an alpha radiation detector. Another safety program is criticality safety the process established to prevent the initiation of self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. There are two main types of controls used to prevent criticality accidents: administrative controls and physical controls. Administrative controls refer to a series of rules and regulations that limit how much material may be in a specific type of container or location to prevent a critical mass from forming. Physical controls such as the use of specially sized and configured pipes or designated storage locations that ensure proper spacing are designed to separate fissile material and prevent a critical mass. Russian nuclear facilities predominantly use physical controls, which are the more stringent and secure of the two types of controls, although we question whether they routinely follow their own rules. Safety and Security at Russian Civilian Nuclear Power Plants Russia has announced plans to more than double its capacity to generate nuclear power over the next years, to begin construction of reactors with enhanced safety features, and to restart its long-dormant fast breeder reactor program. The funding has not yet been allocated. To fulfill the plan, Russia will have to extend the lives of the first-generation plants, which presents some risk to the safety of individuals living near them. Russian RBMK and VVER- and - reactors are aging and seven first- generation Russian nuclear power reactors will reach the end of their service lives within the next five years. A major continuing problem for the Russian nuclear power industry is the failure of its customers to pay for electricity, which has contributed to a lack of resources for maintenance, spare parts, and salaries. Western assistance has been improving the safety systems and operating procedures at Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. However, inherent design deficiencies in RBMK and older model VVER reactors will prevent them from ever meeting Western safety standards. The most notable design flaw is the lack of a Western-style containment structure to prevent the release of fission products in the event of a serious accident. Other serious design shortcomings include poor fire safety and undersized emergency core cooling systems. Another potential disastrous flaw in the VVER reactors is the susceptibility of its reactor pressure vessels to become brittle because of radiation, thermal changes, and mechanical vibrations. This gradual loss of malleability, which particularly affects the welds, could cause the container to crack and rupture, especially during an emergency shutdown when the vessel is suddenly filled with comparatively cold water. After the September terrorist attacks in the United States, Minister of Atomic Energy Aleksandr Rumyantsev reported that Russian nuclear power facilities are protected by special guards patrolling around the clock in addition to national defense forces. A Rosenergoatom official reported on September that security services at the nuclear power plants are already working a harsh regime because of the continuing military actions in Chechnya and that additional security measures were not necessary. Since July, Russian media have reported increased security measures at a number of plants: The Voronezh Oblast decided to reinforce security at the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant. The Main Directorate of Internal Affairs of the Oblast was to coordinate with the Federal Security Service to ensure adequate protection of the plant s perimeter, and trees and vegetation around the plant were to be cut down. An exercise was conducted at the Volgodonsk nuclear power plant to practice preventing a terrorist act. The exercise involved plant personnel and units from the power ministries. The Kola nuclear power station stepped up security. Internal troops were continually patrolling the perimeter, additional checkpoints had been set up, and armored personnel carriers were available to respond to a call. In Rostov, an FSB spokesman said his agency and other law enforcement officials had learned of possible extremist threats to nuclear installations in the region and were enhancing protection of the nuclear power plant. Even with increased security, however, Russian nuclear power plants almost certainly will remain vulnerable to a well-planned and executed terrorist attack.","Annual Report to Congress on the Safety and Security of Russian Nuclear Facilities and Military Forces February Scope Note Congress has directed the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to submit to the Congressional leadership and intelligence committees an annual, unclassified report assessing the safety and security of the nuclear facilities and military forces in Russia.

We assess that by June , the last of the former Soviet tactical nuclear warheads were withdrawn to Russia, and that by the end of , the last of the strategic nuclear warheads had been removed from Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Russian officials have stated that thousands of nuclear warheads from the former Soviet stockpile have been dismantled since ; reportedly over , warheads have been eliminated. Bilateral agreements between Ukraine and Russia called for the elimination of some , nuclear warheads both nonstrategic and strategic that were once stored on the territory of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials reportedly monitored the disassembly of these nuclear warheads at the Russian dismantlement facilities. Press reports indicate that the Ukrainian nuclear warheads were eliminated by . Moscow is significantly reducing its nonstrategic nuclear stockpile. In October , then-Soviet President Gorbachev, responding to a US presidential initiative, announced that the Soviet Union would unilaterally consolidate most of its nonstrategic nuclear warheads in central depots and would eliminate a major portion of them. In January , President Yel'tsin publicly reaffirmed Gorbachev s announcement. Although Russia has taken some actions to fulfill these pledges, Moscow because of concerns over deteriorating conventional capabilities probably will retain several thousand nonstrategic nuclear warheads through at least . Physical Security. To secure their weapons, the Russians employ a multi-layered approach that includes physical, procedural, and technical measures. The security system was designed in the Soviet era to protect weapons primarily against a threat from outside the country and may not be sufficient to meet today s challenge of a knowledgeable insider collaborating with a criminal or terrorist group. General-Colonel Igor Valynkin, chief of the th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense ( th GUMO) the organization responsible for warhead storage, maintenance, and logistics stated in August that there have been no incidents of attempted theft, seizure, or unauthorized actions involving nuclear weapons. Since the September terrorist attacks in the United States, President Putin and Valynkin have conducted a public campaign to provide assurances that terrorists have not acquired Russian nuclear weapons. Valynkin announced on October that security had been stepped up at Russian nuclear weapons storage sites since the attacks on the United States. He also noted that security had been heightened earlier in the year after Russian authorities had twice thwarted terrorist efforts to reconnoiter nuclear weapons storage sites. Valynkin stated that none of the terrorists entered the nuclear weapons sites. At a subsequent press conference on October, Valynkin was adamant that no Russian nuclear weapons had been stolen and described such allegations as barking mad. He reiterated that nuclear warhead personnel are subject to psychological, lie detector, drug, and alcohol testing. In a November interview, President Putin said he was absolutely confident that terrorists in Afghanistan do not have Soviet or Russian weapons of mass destruction. Over the last six years, Moscow has recognized the need for security improvements and, with US assistance, has taken steps to reduce the risk of theft. We judge that nuclear security would improve over time if Russia routinely implemented security upgrades and procedures under US- funded threat reduction programs. Some of the key US-funded security upgrade programs include: Perimeter security upgrades around nuclear storage sites, including fences, sensors, and alarms. Computers to automate the warhead inventory management system. Transportation upgrades to railcars and the provision of supercontainers and Kevlar blankets for shipment of warheads to increase their protection from small- arms fire. Training and equipment for Emergency Response Teams for nuclear accidents. Valynkin has admitted that a lack of domestic funding has made Russia dependent on foreign assistance for physical security upgrades. Quoting Valynkin, an August press report stated that the United States is financing the procurement of security systems for the MOD. The newspaper also described Valynkin as troubled because only a third of the new equipment had been put into service due to funding shortages. Despite the lack of funds, however, the chief of the MOD s Special Construction Troops reported in December that security enhancements were being completed at dozens of nuclear facilities. Even with the enhancements, security problems may still exist at the nuclear weapons storage sites. In August , an anonymous military officer claimed in a Russian television program interview that security was lax at th GUMO sites. The officer outlined a number of problems at the storage sites, including charges that there are personnel shortages and that alarms systems operate only percent of the time. The officer speculated that a terrorist organization could seize a nuclear warhead. Personnel Reliability. Much like other parts of the military, the Strategic Rocket Forces and the th GUMO have also suffered from wage arrears as well as shortages of food and housing allowances. In , the th GUMO closed a nuclear weapons storage site due to hunger strikes by the workers; in , families of several nuclear units protested over wage and benefit arrears. According to Russian press, the MOD addressed most of the arrears by early , and wages are now paid regularly. Even when paid, however, officers wages rarely exceed $ a month and wives cannot earn a second income because the storage sites are usually located far from cities, according to the anonymous th GUMO officer. Housing for th GUMO personnel is of poor quality or nonexistent. According to the Chief of Staff of the th GUMO, there are , homeless active duty and retired officers. The poor living conditions of the officers who contend with lack of heating, leaky plumbing, and deteriorating buildings have been reported by Russian press. Moscow has acknowledged the potential vulnerability of its nuclear security personnel. In October , General Valynkin referenced serious incidents that had occurred at some of his subordinate facilities and stated that more stringent selection criteria for nuclear warhead personnel would be used. Speaking at a press conference concerning US CTR funding in February , Valynkin acknowledged, the greatest problem is the person who works with nuclear warheads. He knows the secrets, he has the access, he knows the security system. Valynkin emphasized that personnel are thoroughly screened for links to the crime world and for their suitability to work with warheads. He added that the th GUMO would be using US CTR-provided polygraph equipment and drug and alcohol tests to monitor the reliability of its personnel. In May , Valynkin stated that two students at the th GUMO s Security Assessment Training Center were expelled as a result of the drug tests. Valynkin also reported in May that the MOD is changing warhead transport security operations by using officers rather than enlisted personnel because across the entire MOD, during that month alone, seven sentries had left their posts. Ministry of Atomic Energy Nuclear Materials Security Russian officials recognize the need to improve the security of weapons-usable nuclear materials that we assess are stored in over buildings at over facilities across the country. After a cabinet meeting on the topic in September , Prime Minister Kasyanov stated publicly that protection of fissile materials varies from place to place and that in some cases the material is endangered. At the same press conference, a Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy noted that reported attempts to steal fissile materials had dropped significantly in recent years. He said that whereas there were such reports from to , there were only two from to . The Deputy Minister also criticized Western press reports for exaggerating the problem. Minatom officials provided no details about the incidents and have not subsequently provided updated data for and . There have been, however, a number of press reports about materials seized in Russia about which we have no further information because Russia typically does not reveal the results of its investigations. Press reports, in fact, generally overstate the impact of stolen material, often referring to or implying that depleted, natural, or low- enriched uranium are weapons-grade or weapons-usable material. Weapons-usable material is defined as uranium enriched to percent or greater in the uranium- or uranium- isotopes (highly enriched uranium HEU) and any plutonium containing less than percent of the isotope plutonium- . Weapons-grade material is typically defined as uranium enriched to greater than percent uranium- or uranium- , or plutonium- containing less than percent plutonium- . Russian institutes have lost weapons-grade and weapons-usable nuclear materials in thefts. In , . kilograms of -percent- enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen from the Luch Production Association. In , . kilograms of -percent- enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen in Moscow. In , we confirmed that a Bulgarian seizure of nuclear material was weapons- usable. The material four grams of HEU likely originated in Russia. In contrast, non-weapons-grade nuclear material thefts, particularly containers of radionuclides such as cesium- or strontium- , have been frequent and well documented. Terrorists could use these radionuclides to build a radiological dispersal device (RDD). An RDD is defined as a device designed to disperse radioactive material to cause injury and contamination by means of the radiation. Reportedly, Chechen terrorists placed a container holding a small amount of cesium- in a Moscow Park in November . Remarking on this event, General Dudayev, the former leader of the Chechen independence movement, stated ""[this] is just a scant portion of the radioactive substances which we have at our disposal."" Although not independently confirmed, reports of a theft in from an unnamed enterprise in Chelyabinsk Oblast are of concern. According to Viktor Yerastov, chief of Minatom's Nuclear Materials Accounting and Control Department, the amount stolen was ""quite sufficient material to produce an atomic bomb"" the only nuclear theft that has been so described. The reduction in seizures of stolen material and in reported theft attempts may be due to several factors: US assistance to improve security at Russian facilities, a possible decrease in smuggling, or smugglers becoming more knowledgeable about evading detection. We assess that undetected smuggling has occurred, although we do not know the extent or magnitude of undetected thefts. Nevertheless, we are concerned about the total amount of material that could have been diverted over the last years. Efforts To Improve Physical Security and Safeguards. Prior to DOE assistance to enhance safeguards and security, Russian MPC&A practices did not meet internationally accepted standards. Russian facilities housing nuclear materials typically receive low funding, lack trained security personnel, and do not have sufficient equipment for securely storing nuclear materials. The DOE-administered MPC&A program, as well as other programs, is assisting the former Soviet states to upgrade safeguards (accountability and control) over nuclear materials and physical security at a wide range of nuclear facilities. For example: A US-funded computer system to handle inventory reporting to Minatom headquarters began to come on-line at pilot facilities in mid- and will require officials to track materials closely to better assure timely detection in the event of a loss or diversion. The US Department of Defense is helping Russia to build a state-of-the-art storage facility for long-term secure storage of plutonium and HEU from dismantled nuclear weapons. Russia and the United States have broadened their cooperative work to include securing Russian Navy highly enriched uranium reactor fuel at three naval land-based storage sites. The United States is purchasing MT of HEU $ billion over a -year period which Russia is blending down into low-enriched uranium suitable for use in nuclear power reactors. A new DOE/Minatom effort seeks to convert highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium under the MPC&A Program s Material Consolidation and Conversion initiative. DOE has implemented a sustainability program to assist with maintenance, training, and operation of the upgraded physical security systems in response to Russian budgetary problems and potential neglect of equipment. In mid- DOE reported that by the end of FY ""comprehensive"" security upgrades would have expanded to cover an estimated percent of Russia s weapons-usable nuclear material, and that if facilities protected by rapid upgrades were added, the percentage would increase to . When Rapid upgrades include items such as baseline item inventories, locks, delay blocks, steel cages, limiting access, and hardening windows. Comprehensive upgrades include rapid upgrades plus detection systems, closed-circuit television monitoring and the upgrades currently underway are completed, the portion of material with improved security will increase to approximately percent. Progress is most advanced at civilian institutes and Russian Navy sites, and lags at Minatom facilities within the nuclear weapons complex which contain most of the material of proliferation interest because Russian security concerns prevent direct US access to sensitive materials. The progress at civilian and naval sites addresses key vulnerabilities because seizures involving HEU and separated plutonium have been linked to these locations rather than nuclear weapons assembly/disassembly plants. Russia s nuclear MPC&A has been slowly improving over the last several years, but risks remain. Economics and Personnel Reliability. Even after technical modernization, security for weapons-usable nuclear material depends largely on the diligence, competence, and morale of personnel who monitor systems and guard material and facilities and on managers who must emphasize security over production. Programs to improve physical security, accountability, and training could be undermined by disgruntled Russian personnel or unreceptive managers and employees. Because of improvements in the national economy, Russia and Minatom are now able to pay personnel on time. Thus, for now, compensation and benefits appear adequate, and personnel no longer face the financial pressures of the late s that might have led some to permit or actively participate in weapons-usable nuclear material theft. assessment systems, material measurement equipment, and computerized accounting systems. Convenience and pressure to produce also can contribute to lapses in security. US Government Accounting Office auditors noted in their February report that, at one facility, a gate in a fence emplaced with US aid around a weapons-usable nuclear material storage building was routinely left open and unguarded during the day. Russian officials explained that it was simply too much trouble for the employees to open and close the combination lock repeatedly as they entered and left the building. This practice, however, undermined control of access and meant that the only security measures in effect were the perimeter fence and guards at the facility. Safety at Russian Nuclear Material Processing Facilities Russian HEU facilities have at least three levels of contamination control. Level one denotes an area of essentially no contamination. Level two denotes an area of lower contamination where personnel are required to wear protective clothing and masks, but extensive monitoring is not required. Such areas include oxide purification, calcining, container storage, and fluorination. Level three denotes an area of high contamination that requires protective clothing and masks, and requires extensive monitoring to reduce the spread of contamination. Such areas include metal machining and oxidation. The monitoring of personnel radiation safety is also a multi-layered process. Workers and visitors are required to wear the standard Russian particulate control mask while in nuclear facilities. In addition, shoes and protective clothing (hats, gloves, lab coats, and in the chemical metallurgical areas full body protective clothing) are provided. Radiation dosimeters are available and generally are used by Russians and visitors to their plants. Radiation- monitoring devices mounted along the walls are present in areas of HEU operations, along with air-sampling ports. Personnel and visitors are required to wash their hands when leaving contaminated areas; then both hands and feet are checked by an alpha radiation detector. Another safety program is criticality safety the process established to prevent the initiation of self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. There are two main types of controls used to prevent criticality accidents: administrative controls and physical controls. Administrative controls refer to a series of rules and regulations that limit how much material may be in a specific type of container or location to prevent a critical mass from forming. Physical controls such as the use of specially sized and configured pipes or designated storage locations that ensure proper spacing are designed to separate fissile material and prevent a critical mass. Russian nuclear facilities predominantly use physical controls, which are the more stringent and secure of the two types of controls, although we question whether they routinely follow their own rules. Safety and Security at Russian Civilian Nuclear Power Plants Russia has announced plans to more than double its capacity to generate nuclear power over the next years, to begin construction of reactors with enhanced safety features, and to restart its long-dormant fast breeder reactor program. The funding has not yet been allocated. To fulfill the plan, Russia will have to extend the lives of the first-generation plants, which presents some risk to the safety of individuals living near them. Russian RBMK and VVER- and - reactors are aging and seven first- generation Russian nuclear power reactors will reach the end of their service lives within the next five years. A major continuing problem for the Russian nuclear power industry is the failure of its customers to pay for electricity, which has contributed to a lack of resources for maintenance, spare parts, and salaries. Western assistance has been improving the safety systems and operating procedures at Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. However, inherent design deficiencies in RBMK and older model VVER reactors will prevent them from ever meeting Western safety standards. The most notable design flaw is the lack of a Western-style containment structure to prevent the release of fission products in the event of a serious accident. Other serious design shortcomings include poor fire safety and undersized emergency core cooling systems. Another potential disastrous flaw in the VVER reactors is the susceptibility of its reactor pressure vessels to become brittle because of radiation, thermal changes, and mechanical vibrations. This gradual loss of malleability, which particularly affects the welds, could cause the container to crack and rupture, especially during an emergency shutdown when the vessel is suddenly filled with comparatively cold water. After the September terrorist attacks in the United States, Minister of Atomic Energy Aleksandr Rumyantsev reported that Russian nuclear power facilities are protected by special guards patrolling around the clock in addition to national defense forces. A Rosenergoatom official reported on September that security services at the nuclear power plants are already working a harsh regime because of the continuing military actions in Chechnya and that additional security measures were not necessary. Since July, Russian media have reported increased security measures at a number of plants: The Voronezh Oblast decided to reinforce security at the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant. The Main Directorate of Internal Affairs of the Oblast was to coordinate with the Federal Security Service to ensure adequate protection of the plant s perimeter, and trees and vegetation around the plant were to be cut down. An exercise was conducted at the Volgodonsk nuclear power plant to practice preventing a terrorist act. The exercise involved plant personnel and units from the power ministries. The Kola nuclear power station stepped up security. Internal troops were continually patrolling the perimeter, additional checkpoints had been set up, and armored personnel carriers were available to respond to a call. In Rostov, an FSB spokesman said his agency and other law enforcement officials had learned of possible extremist threats to nuclear installations in the region and were enhancing protection of the nuclear power plant. Even with increased security, however, Russian nuclear power plants almost certainly will remain vulnerable to a well-planned and executed terrorist attack."
Older Intelligence Products (1999-2015),2002NIEIraq.pdf,2003: Unclassified Key Judgments - Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction (from October 2002 NIE),2003,George W. Bush,Republican,George Tenet,Director of Central Intelligence (DCI),"Iraq s Continuing Program for Weapons of Mass Destruction Key Judgments (from October NIE) We judge that Iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs in defiance of UN resolutions and restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of UN restrictions; if left unchecked, it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade. (See INR alternative view at the end of these Key Judgments.) We judge that we are seeing only a portion of Iraq's WMD efforts, owing to Baghdad's vigorous denial and deception efforts. Revelations after the Gulf war starkly demonstrate the extensive efforts undertaken by Iraq to deny information. We lack specific information on many key aspects of Iraq's WMD programs. Since inspections ended in , Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort, energized its missile program, and invested more heavily in biological weapons; in the view of most agencies, Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Iraq's growing ability to sell oil illicitly increases Baghdad's capabilities to finance WMD programs; annual earnings in cash and goods have more than quadrupled, from $ million in to about $ billion this year. Iraq has largely rebuilt missile and biological weapons facilities damaged during Operation Desert Fox and has expanded its chemical and biological infrastructure under the cover of civilian production. Baghdad has exceeded UN range limits of km with its ballistic missiles and is working with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which allow for a more lethal means to deliver biological and, less likely, chemical warfare agents. Although we assess that Saddam does not yet have nuclear weapons or sufficient material to make any, he remains intent on acquiring them. Most agencies assess that Baghdad started reconstituting its nuclear program about the time that UNSCOM inspectors departed-December . How quickly Iraq will obtain its first nuclear weapon depends on when it acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile material. If Baghdad acquires sufficient fissile material from abroad it could make a nuclear weapon within several months to a year. End Without such material from abroad, Iraq probably would not be able to make a weapon until to , owing to inexperience in building and operating centrifuge facilities to produce highly enriched uranium and challenges in procuring the necessary equipment and expertise. - Most agencies believe that Saddam's personal interest in and Iraq's aggressive attempts to obtain high-strength aluminum tubes for centrifuge rotors-as well as Iraq's attempts to acquire magnets, high-speed balancing machines, and machine tools- provide compelling evidence that Saddam is reconstituting a uranium enrichment effort for Baghdad's nuclear weapons program. (DOE agrees that reconstitution of the nuclear program is underway but assesses that the tubes probably are not part of the program.) - Iraq's efforts to re-establish and enhance its cadre of weapons personnel as well as activities at several suspect nuclear sites further indicate that reconstitution is underway. - All agencies agree that about , centrifuges based on tubes of the size Iraq is trying to acquire would be capable of producing approximately two weapons' worth of highly enriched uranium per year. In a much less likely scenario, Baghdad could make enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by to if it obtains suitable centrifuge tubes this year and has all the other materials and technological expertise necessary to build production-scale uranium enrichment facilities. We assess that Baghdad has begun renewed production of mustard, sarin, GF (cyclosarin), and VX; its capability probably is more limited now than it was at the time of the Gulf war, although VX production and agent storage life probably have been improved. An array of clandestine reporting reveals that Baghdad has procured covertly the types and quantities of chemicals and equipment sufficient to allow limited CW agent production hidden within Iraq's legitimate chemical industry. Although we have little specific information on Iraq's CW stockpile, Saddam probably has stocked at least metric tons (MT) and possibly as much as MT of CW agents-much of it added in the last year. The Iraqis have experience in manufacturing CW bombs, artillery rockets, and projectiles. We assess that that they possess CW bulk fills for SRBM warheads, including for a limited number of covertly stored Scuds, possibly a few with extended ranges. We judge that all key aspects-R&D, production, and weaponization-of Iraq's offensive BW program are active and that most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf war. We judge Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating BW agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery by bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives. End - Chances are even that smallpox is part of Iraq's offensive BW program. - Baghdad probably has developed genetically engineered BW agents. Baghdad has established a large-scale, redundant, and concealed BW agent production capability. - Baghdad has mobile facilities for producing bacterial and toxin BW agents; these facilities can evade detection and are highly survivable. Within three to six months* these units probably could produce an amount of agent equal to the total that Iraq produced in the years prior to the Gulf war. Iraq maintains a small missile force and several development programs, including for a UAV probably intended to deliver biological warfare agent. Gaps in Iraqi accounting to UNSCOM suggest that Saddam retains a covert force of up to a few dozen Scud-variant SRBMs with ranges of to km. Iraq is deploying its new al-Samoud and Ababil- SRBMs, which are capable of flying beyond the UN-authorized -km range limit; Iraq has tested an al-Samoud variant beyond km-perhaps as far as km. Baghdad's UAVs could threaten Iraq's neighbors, US forces in the Persian Gulf, and if brought close to, or into, the United States, the US Homeland. - An Iraqi UAV procurement network attempted to procure commercially available route planning software and an associated topographic database that would be able to support targeting of the United States, according to analysis of special intelligence. - The Director, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, US Air Force, does not agree that Iraq is developing UAVs primarily intended to be delivery platforms for chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents. The small size of Iraq's new UAV strongly suggests a primary role of reconnaissance, although CBW delivery is an inherent capability. Iraq is developing medium-range ballistic missile capabilities, largely through foreign assistance in building specialized facilities, including a test stand for engines more powerful than those in its current missile force. We have low confidence in our ability to assess when Saddam would use WMD. Saddam could decide to use chemical and biological warfare (CBW) preemptively against US forces, friends, and allies in the region in an attempt to disrupt US war preparations and undermine the political will of the Coalition. *[Corrected per Errata sheet issued in October ] End Saddam might use CBW after an initial advance into Iraqi territory, but early use of WMD could foreclose diplomatic options for stalling the US advance. He probably would use CBW when he perceived he irretrievably had lost control of the military and security situation, but we are unlikely to know when Saddam reaches that point. We judge that Saddam would be more likely to use chemical weapons than biological weapons on the battlefield. Saddam historically has maintained tight control over the use of WMD; however, he probably has provided contingency instructions to his commanders to use CBW in specific circumstances. Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against the United States, fearing that exposure of Iraqi involvement would provide Washington a stronger cause for making war. Iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the US Homeland if Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable, or possibly for revenge. Such attacks-more likely with biological than chemical agents-probably would be carried out by special forces or intelligence operatives. The Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) probably has been directed to conduct clandestine attacks against US and Allied interests in the Middle East in the event the United States takes action against Iraq. The IIS probably would be the primary means by which Iraq would attempt to conduct any CBW attacks on the US Homeland, although we have no specific intelligence information that Saddam's regime has directed attacks against US territory. Saddam, if sufficiently desperate, might decide that only an organization such as al-Qa'ida-with worldwide reach and extensive terrorist infrastructure, and already engaged in a life-or-death struggle against the United States-could perpetrate the type of terrorist attack that he would hope to conduct. In such circumstances, he might decide that the extreme step of assisting the Islamist terrorists in conducting a CBW attack against the United States would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him. State/INR Alternative View of Iraq's Nuclear Program The Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research (INR) believes that Saddam continues to want nuclear weapons and that available evidence indicates that Baghdad is pursuing at least a limited effort to maintain and acquire nuclear weapon- related capabilities. The activities we have detected do not, however, add up to a compelling case that Iraq is currently pursuing what INR would consider to be an integrated and comprehensive approach to (continued on next page ...) End (continued ...) State/INR Alternative View acquire nuclear weapons. Iraq may be doing so, but INR considers the available evidence inadequate to support such a judgment. Lacking persuasive evidence that Baghdad has launched a coherent effort to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program, INR is unwilling to speculate that such an effort began soon after the departure of UN inspectors or to project a timeline for the completion of activities it does not now see happening. As a result, INR is unable to predict when Iraq could acquire a nuclear device or weapon. In INR's view Iraq's efforts to acquire aluminum tubes is central to the argument that Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program, but INR is not persuaded that the tubes in question are intended for use as centrifuge rotors. INR accepts the judgment of technical experts at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) who have concluded that the tubes Iraq seeks to acquire are poorly suited for use in gas centrifuges to be used for uranium enrichment and finds unpersuasive the arguments advanced by others to make the case that they are intended for that purpose. INR considers it far more likely that the tubes are intended for another purpose, most likely the production of artillery rockets. The very large quantities being sought, the way the tubes were tested by the Iraqis, and the atypical lack of attention to operational security in the procurement efforts are among the factors, in addition to the DOE assessment, that lead INR to conclude that the tubes are not intended for use in Iraq's nuclear weapon program. Confidence Levels for Selected Key Judgments in This Estimate High Confidence: Iraq is continuing, and in some areas expanding, its chemical, biological, nuclear and missile programs contrary to UN resolutions. We are not detecting portions of these weapons programs. Iraq possesses proscribed chemical and biological weapons and missiles. Iraq could make a nuclear weapon in months to a year once it acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile material. Moderate Confidence: Iraq does not yet have a nuclear weapon or sufficient material to make one but is likely to have a weapon by to . (See INR alternative view, ). Low Confidence: When Saddam would use weapons of mass destruction. Whether Saddam would engage in clandestine attacks against the US Homeland. Whether in desperation Saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with al- Qa'ida. End Uranium Acquisition Iraq retains approximately two-and-a-half tons of . percent enriched uranium oxide, which the IAEA permits. This low-enriched material could be used as feed material to produce enough HEU for about two nuclear weapons. The use of enriched feed material also would reduce the initial number of centrifuges that Baghdad would need by about half. Iraq could divert this material-the IAEA inspects it only once a year-and enrich it to weapons Excerpt from grade before a subsequent inspection discovered it was missing. The IAEA last inspected this material in late January . Iraq has about metric tons of yellowcake and low-enriched uranium at Tuwaitha, which is inspected annually by the IAEA. Iraq also began vigorously trying to procure uranium ore and yellowcake; acquiring either would shorten the time Baghdad needs to produce nuclear weapons. A foreign government service reported that as of early , Niger planned to send several tons of ""pure uranium"" (probably yellowcake) to Iraq. As of early , Niger and Iraq reportedly were still working out arrangements for this deal, which could be for up to tons of yellowcake . We do not know the status of this arrangement. Reports indicate Iraq also has sought uranium ore from Somalia and possibly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We cannot confirm whether Iraq succeeded in acquiring uranium ore and/or yellowcake from these sources. Reports suggest Iraq is shifting from domestic mining and milling of uranium to foreign acquisition. Iraq possesses significant phosphate deposits, from which uranium had been chemically extracted before Operation Desert Storm. Intelligence information on whether nuclear-related phosphate mining and/or processing has been reestablished is inconclusive, however. A refined form of natural uranium. Excerpt from Annex A Iraq's Attempts to Acquire Aluminum Tubes [This excerpt from a longer view includes INR's position on the African uranium issue] INR's Alternative View: Iraq's Attempts to Acquire Aluminum Tubes Some of the specialized but dual-use items being sought are, by all indications, bound for Iraq's missile program. Other cases are ambiguous, such as that of a planned magnet-production line whose suitability for centrifuge operations remains unknown. Some efforts involve non-controlled industrial material and equipment-including a variety of machine tools-and are troubling because they would help establish the infrastructure for a renewed nuclear program. But such efforts (which began well before the inspectors departed) are not clearly linked to a nuclear end-use. Finally, the claims of Iraqi pursuit of natural uranium in Africa are, in INR's assessment, highly dubious.

Iraq maintains a small missile force and several development programs, including for a UAV probably intended to deliver biological warfare agent. Gaps in Iraqi accounting to UNSCOM suggest that Saddam retains a covert force of up to a few dozen Scud-variant SRBMs with ranges of to km. Iraq is deploying its new al-Samoud and Ababil- SRBMs, which are capable of flying beyond the UN-authorized -km range limit; Iraq has tested an al-Samoud variant beyond km-perhaps as far as km. Baghdad's UAVs could threaten Iraq's neighbors, US forces in the Persian Gulf, and if brought close to, or into, the United States, the US Homeland. - An Iraqi UAV procurement network attempted to procure commercially available route planning software and an associated topographic database that would be able to support targeting of the United States, according to analysis of special intelligence. - The Director, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, US Air Force, does not agree that Iraq is developing UAVs primarily intended to be delivery platforms for chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents. The small size of Iraq's new UAV strongly suggests a primary role of reconnaissance, although CBW delivery is an inherent capability. Iraq is developing medium-range ballistic missile capabilities, largely through foreign assistance in building specialized facilities, including a test stand for engines more powerful than those in its current missile force. We have low confidence in our ability to assess when Saddam would use WMD. Saddam could decide to use chemical and biological warfare (CBW) preemptively against US forces, friends, and allies in the region in an attempt to disrupt US war preparations and undermine the political will of the Coalition. *[Corrected per Errata sheet issued in October ] End Saddam might use CBW after an initial advance into Iraqi territory, but early use of WMD could foreclose diplomatic options for stalling the US advance. He probably would use CBW when he perceived he irretrievably had lost control of the military and security situation, but we are unlikely to know when Saddam reaches that point. We judge that Saddam would be more likely to use chemical weapons than biological weapons on the battlefield. Saddam historically has maintained tight control over the use of WMD; however, he probably has provided contingency instructions to his commanders to use CBW in specific circumstances. Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against the United States, fearing that exposure of Iraqi involvement would provide Washington a stronger cause for making war. Iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the US Homeland if Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable, or possibly for revenge. Such attacks-more likely with biological than chemical agents-probably would be carried out by special forces or intelligence operatives. The Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) probably has been directed to conduct clandestine attacks against US and Allied interests in the Middle East in the event the United States takes action against Iraq. The IIS probably would be the primary means by which Iraq would attempt to conduct any CBW attacks on the US Homeland, although we have no specific intelligence information that Saddam's regime has directed attacks against US territory. Saddam, if sufficiently desperate, might decide that only an organization such as al-Qa'ida-with worldwide reach and extensive terrorist infrastructure, and already engaged in a life-or-death struggle against the United States-could perpetrate the type of terrorist attack that he would hope to conduct. In such circumstances, he might decide that the extreme step of assisting the Islamist terrorists in conducting a CBW attack against the United States would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him. State/INR Alternative View of Iraq's Nuclear Program The Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research (INR) believes that Saddam continues to want nuclear weapons and that available evidence indicates that Baghdad is pursuing at least a limited effort to maintain and acquire nuclear weapon- related capabilities. The activities we have detected do not, however, add up to a compelling case that Iraq is currently pursuing what INR would consider to be an integrated and comprehensive approach to (continued on next page ...) End (continued ...) State/INR Alternative View acquire nuclear weapons. Iraq may be doing so, but INR considers the available evidence inadequate to support such a judgment. Lacking persuasive evidence that Baghdad has launched a coherent effort to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program, INR is unwilling to speculate that such an effort began soon after the departure of UN inspectors or to project a timeline for the completion of activities it does not now see happening. As a result, INR is unable to predict when Iraq could acquire a nuclear device or weapon. In INR's view Iraq's efforts to acquire aluminum tubes is central to the argument that Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program, but INR is not persuaded that the tubes in question are intended for use as centrifuge rotors. INR accepts the judgment of technical experts at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) who have concluded that the tubes Iraq seeks to acquire are poorly suited for use in gas centrifuges to be used for uranium enrichment and finds unpersuasive the arguments advanced by others to make the case that they are intended for that purpose. INR considers it far more likely that the tubes are intended for another purpose, most likely the production of artillery rockets. The very large quantities being sought, the way the tubes were tested by the Iraqis, and the atypical lack of attention to operational security in the procurement efforts are among the factors, in addition to the DOE assessment, that lead INR to conclude that the tubes are not intended for use in Iraq's nuclear weapon program. Confidence Levels for Selected Key Judgments in This Estimate High Confidence: Iraq is continuing, and in some areas expanding, its chemical, biological, nuclear and missile programs contrary to UN resolutions. We are not detecting portions of these weapons programs. Iraq possesses proscribed chemical and biological weapons and missiles. Iraq could make a nuclear weapon in months to a year once it acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile material. Moderate Confidence: Iraq does not yet have a nuclear weapon or sufficient material to make one but is likely to have a weapon by to . (See INR alternative view, ). Low Confidence: When Saddam would use weapons of mass destruction. Whether Saddam would engage in clandestine attacks against the US Homeland. Whether in desperation Saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with al- Qa'ida. End Uranium Acquisition Iraq retains approximately two-and-a-half tons of . percent enriched uranium oxide, which the IAEA permits. This low-enriched material could be used as feed material to produce enough HEU for about two nuclear weapons. The use of enriched feed material also would reduce the initial number of centrifuges that Baghdad would need by about half. Iraq could divert this material-the IAEA inspects it only once a year-and enrich it to weapons Excerpt from grade before a subsequent inspection discovered it was missing. The IAEA last inspected this material in late January . Iraq has about metric tons of yellowcake and low-enriched uranium at Tuwaitha, which is inspected annually by the IAEA. Iraq also began vigorously trying to procure uranium ore and yellowcake; acquiring either would shorten the time Baghdad needs to produce nuclear weapons. A foreign government service reported that as of early , Niger planned to send several tons of ""pure uranium"" (probably yellowcake) to Iraq. As of early , Niger and Iraq reportedly were still working out arrangements for this deal, which could be for up to tons of yellowcake . We do not know the status of this arrangement. Reports indicate Iraq also has sought uranium ore from Somalia and possibly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We cannot confirm whether Iraq succeeded in acquiring uranium ore and/or yellowcake from these sources. Reports suggest Iraq is shifting from domestic mining and milling of uranium to foreign acquisition. Iraq possesses significant phosphate deposits, from which uranium had been chemically extracted before Operation Desert Storm. Intelligence information on whether nuclear-related phosphate mining and/or processing has been reestablished is inconclusive, however. A refined form of natural uranium. Excerpt from Annex A Iraq's Attempts to Acquire Aluminum Tubes [This excerpt from a longer view includes INR's position on the African uranium issue] INR's Alternative View: Iraq's Attempts to Acquire Aluminum Tubes Some of the specialized but dual-use items being sought are, by all indications, bound for Iraq's missile program. Other cases are ambiguous, such as that of a planned magnet-production line whose suitability for centrifuge operations remains unknown. Some efforts involve non-controlled industrial material and equipment-including a variety of machine tools-and are troubling because they would help establish the infrastructure for a renewed nuclear program. But such efforts (which began well before the inspectors departed) are not clearly linked to a nuclear end-use. Finally, the claims of Iraqi pursuit of natural uranium in Africa are, in INR's assessment, highly dubious. Excerpt from"
Older Intelligence Products (1999-2015),2004NuclearSafety.pdf,2004: Annual Report to Congress on the Safety and Security of Russian Nuclear Facilities and Military Forces,2004,George W. Bush,Republican,Porter Goss,Director of Central Intelligence (DCI),"Annual Report to Congress on the Safety and Security of Russian Nuclear Facilities and Military Forces December Scope Note Congress has directed the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to submit to the Congressional leadership and intelligence committees an annual, unclassified report assessing the safety and security of the nuclear facilities and military forces in Russia. Congress has requested that each report include a discussion of the following: The ability of the Russian Government to maintain its nuclear military forces. The security arrangements at Russia s civilian and military nuclear facilities. The reliability of controls and safety systems at Russia s civilian nuclear facilities. The reliability of command and control systems and procedures of the nuclear military forces in Russia. This report is the fourth responding to this Congressional request. The report addresses facilities and forces of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Federal Agency for Atomic Energy (formerly the Ministry of Atomic Energy), and other Russian institutes. It updates the February report to Congress. This paper has been prepared under the auspices of the National Intelligence Officer for Weapons of Mass Destruction and Proliferation. Key Points The United States continues to work cooperatively with Moscow to increase the safety and security of nuclear-related facilities, infrastructure, and personnel. Russia is upgrading its physical, procedural, and technical measures to secure its nuclear weapons against both external and internal threats. Russia s nuclear security has been slowly improving over the last several years, but risks remain. We remain concerned about vulnerabilities to an insider who attempts unauthorized actions as well as potential terrorist attacks. An unauthorized launch or accidental use of a Russian nuclear weapon is highly unlikely as long as current technical and procedural safeguards built into the command and control system remain in place and are effectively enforced. Our concerns about possible circumvention of the system would rise if central political authority broke down. Since the September terrorist attacks in the United States, President Putin and other Russian officials have conducted a public campaign to provide assurances that terrorists have not acquired Russian nuclear weapons. Russian officials have reported, however, that terrorists have targeted Russian nuclear weapon storage sites. Security was tightened in after Russian authorities twice thwarted terrorist efforts to reconnoiter nuclear weapon storage sites. Russian facilities housing weapons-usable nuclear material vary from small research facilities and fuel cycle facilities to those involved with nuclear weapons research, development, and production. Small research facilities, although typically under-funded, usually have smaller, static inventories of weapons-usable nuclear material and are easier to secure whereas large fuel fabrication facilities have larger, varying inventories that are more difficult to account for and are much harder to secure. We assess that progress on security enhancements is most advanced at civilian institutes and Russian Navy sites. Progress is impeded at facilities within the Federal Agency for Atomic Energy nuclear weapons complex, which contain most of the material of proliferation interest because Russian security concerns prevent direct US access to sensitive materials. Russia s nuclear material protection, control, and accounting practices have been slowly improving over the last several years, but risks remain. We find it highly unlikely that Russian authorities would have been able to recover all the material reportedly stolen. We assess that undetected smuggling has occurred, and we are concerned about the total amount of material that could have been diverted or stolen in the last years. As for security at nuclear power plants, the commander-in-chief of the Interior Ministry Force said in November that Russia would set up a special-purpose unit tasked to protect nuclear energy industry installations. The unit would be established to counter terrorists and augment existing security. Even with increased security, however, Russian nuclear power plants almost certainly will remain vulnerable to a well-planned and executed terrorist attack. Formerly the Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom). Discussion The United States is working cooperatively with Moscow to increase the safety and security of nuclear-related facilities, infrastructure, and personnel. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) is responsible for the nuclear military forces and its nuclear weapon storage system. The Federal Agency for Atomic Energy (Rosatom), formerly known as the Ministry of Atomic Energy, operates the national nuclear weapons complex, conducts weapons-related tests at the MOD nuclear test site, and controls most nuclear-related institutes and industrial facilities. Rosatom and Rosenergoatom, a state- owned nuclear power concern, operate Russia s nuclear power reactors. We are concerned that Russia may not be able to sustain US-provided security upgrades of facilities over the long-term given the cost and technical sophistication of at least some of the equipment involved. Ministry of Defense Nuclear Weapons Inventory Russia is upgrading its physical, procedural, and technical measures to secure its weapons against both external and internal threats, and Russia s nuclear security has been slowly but For events that took place prior to March , when the Ministry of Atomic Energy was reorganized, we continue to refer to the Ministry of Atomic Energy. In addition to the Russian Defense Ministry and Federal Agency for Atomic Energy, the United States Government works with the following Russian government organizations to improve nuclear warhead and material security: Rosenergoatom, the Russian Navy, the Russian Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety (Gosatomnadzor or GAN), and the Ministries of Interior, Education, and Economy. unevenly improving over the last several years. Risks remain, however, and we continue to be concerned about vulnerabilities to an insider who attempts unauthorized actions as well as potential terrorist attacks. An unauthorized launch or accidental use of a Russian nuclear weapon is highly unlikely as long as current technical and procedural safeguards built into the command and control system remain in place and are effectively enforced. Our concerns about possible circumvention of the system would rise if central political authority broke down. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow has consolidated the former Soviet stockpile into storage sites in Russia. Russian officials have stated that thousands of nuclear warheads from the former Soviet stockpile have been dismantled since ; reportedly over , warheads have been eliminated. Moscow relies on nuclear weapons as its primary means of deterrence, however, and will continue to have thousands of nuclear warheads in its inventory for the foreseeable future. Moscow maintains roughly , operational strategic nuclear warheads in its strategic nuclear triad, which is composed of ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers carrying nuclear-tipped air-launched cruise missiles. Moscow has agreed under the Moscow Treaty to reduce its strategic forces so that on December Russia would have no more than , to , warheads. Although Russia has reduced its nonstrategic nuclear stockpile, it probably will retain several thousand nonstrategic nuclear warheads. In accordance with a unilateral pledge, Moscow consolidated most of its nonstrategic nuclear warheads in central depots and eliminated a major portion of them as a response to a US presidential initiative. The Defense Ministry s th Main Directorate (GUMO) is responsible for the physical protection and safety of nuclear weapons. Specialists from the th GUMO carry out all maintenance work in close collaboration with the warhead designers. The th GUMO also is responsible for nuclear warhead shipments throughout Russia. All nuclear weapons storage sites, except those subordinate to the strategic missile troops, fall under the th GUMO s responsibility, thus facilitating a uniform policy in matters of operation and physical security. In peacetime all nuclear munitions except those on ICBMs and SLBMs on alert status are stored in nuclear weapons storage sites. The Russians employ a multi-layered approach that includes physical, procedural, and technical measures to secure their weapons. Since the September terrorist attacks in the United States, President Putin and other Russian officials have conducted a public campaign to provide assurances that terrorists have not acquired Russian nuclear weapons. In October , former Minister of Atomic Energy Adamov stated, Neither Bin Ladin nor anyone else could steal a nuclear warhead from anywhere in the former Soviet Union. During my time as minister, I carried out a comprehensive stock-taking of everything we had and had had, and traced the history of all the warheads ever produced. So, everything there was on the territories of the former USSR republics was returned to Russia. Nothing was stolen from us. So, neither Bin Ladin, nor Iraq nor Iran could make use of these explosive devices. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said publicly during a visit to Washington in April that it is impossible for Moscow s stockpiles of nuclear weapons and nuclear fuels to fall into the hands of terrorists. In September , then First Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Colonel-General Baluyevskiy, stated that the security of Russian nuclear weapon storage sites is important not only for our country but for the whole world. This is why they are heavily guarded. We have taken all measures to ensure the security of these facilities, from technical to physical ones. Russian officials, however, have reported that terrorists have targeted Russian nuclear weapon storage sites. According to the chief of the th GUMO, Russian authorities twice thwarted terrorist efforts to reconnoiter nuclear weapon storage sites in . In addition, two Chechen sabotage and reconnaissance groups reportedly showed a suspicious amount of interest in the transportation of nuclear munitions. The groups were spotted at several major railroad stations in the Moscow region, apparently interested in a special train used for transporting nuclear bombs. Federal Agency for Atomic Energy Nuclear Materials Security Russian facilities housing weapons-usable nuclear material vary from small research facilities and fuel cycle facilities to those involved with nuclear weapons research, development, and production. Small research facilities, although typically under-funded, usually have smaller, static inventories of weapons- usable nuclear material and are easier to secure; large fuel fabrication facilities have larger, varying inventories that are more difficult to account for and much harder to secure. We assess that progress on security enhancements is most advanced at civilian institutes and Russian Navy sites. Progress is impeded at facilities within the Federal Agency for Atomic Energy nuclear weapons complex, which contain most of the material of proliferation interest, because Russian security concerns prevent direct US access to sensitive materials. Russia s nuclear material protection, control, and accounting (MPC&A) practices have been slowly improving over the last several years, but risks of undetected theft remain. In November , Yuri Vishnevskiy, the head of the Russian Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety, Gosatomnadzor (GAN), told a news conference that there Formerly the Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom). In March , the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Service replaced Gosatomnadzor (GAN). Two months later, this service was merged into a larger regulatory body known as the Federal Service for Environmental, Technological, and Nuclear Oversight. We are Weapons-Usable Nuclear Material Weapons-usable nuclear material is defined as uranium enriched to percent or greater in the uranium- or uranium- isotopes (highly enriched uranium, HEU) and any plutonium containing less than percent of the isotope plutonium- . Weapons-grade material is typically defined as uranium enriched to about percent or greater uranium- or uranium- , or plutonium containing about percent or greater plutonium- . have been documented instances of nuclear materials, including grams of weapons-grade uranium, disappearing from Russian nuclear facilities. He stated that losses most frequently occurred at nuclear materials processing facilities, including Elektrostal near Moscow and the Chemical Concentrates Plant in Novosibirsk. Subsequently Minister of Atomic Energy Rumyantsev acknowledged missing material but claimed that Everything that was lost was subsequently traced and returned to the relevant arsenals. It may not have been instantly, it may have taken several years, but all these thefts were carefully investigated and prevented. We find it highly unlikely that Russian authorities would have been able to recover all the stolen material. Last year GAN continued to find inadequacies in the accounting system for Russian nuclear materials. Its press release in August said, In connection with the lack of concerned this reorganization may not provide for the same level of scrutiny as GAN did. (U) development in creation of a system of state accounting and control of nuclear materials, a significant number of deviations from the normative requirements have been noted, there are anomalies in accounting for nuclear materials, and shortcomings of an organizational nature in the operating organizations have been noted. In March , a memorandum issued by GAN and circulated in the Duma, stated that The analysis of inspections carried out last year shows that there are serious flaws in the physical protection of nuclear risky facilities in the industry. The system of accounting, control, storage and transportation of radioactive materials is not fully operational yet. As a result, the unauthorized use of radioactive materials and their theft cannot be ruled out. Detected Diversions. Russian institutes have lost weapons-grade and weapons-usable nuclear materials in thefts in amounts greater than a few milligrams, contrary to claims by Minatom officials. In each case that we know about, however, the diverted material eventually was seized by government authorities. For example, In , . kilograms of -percent- enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen from the Luch Production Association. In , approximately . kilograms of -percent-enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen in Moscow. In , the US Government confirmed that a Bulgarian seizure of nuclear material was weapons-usable. The material approximately four grams of HEU probably originated in Russia. Although not independently confirmed, reports of a theft in from an unnamed enterprise in Chelyabinsk Oblast are of concern. The chief of the Federal Security Service department in the Chelyabinsk region reported the prevention of the theft of . kilograms of radioactive materials. Viktor Yerastov, then chief of Minatom s Nuclear Materials Accounting and Control Department, without admitting to an amount being stolen, said that if that amount had been stolen, it was ""quite sufficient material to produce an atomic bomb"" the only nuclear theft that has been so described. There have been other press reports about materials seized in Russia about which we have no further information because Russia typically does not reveal the results of its investigations. Press reports generally overstate the impact of stolen material, often referring to or implying that depleted, natural, or low-enriched uranium are weapons-grade or weapons-usable material. The number of seizures of stolen material and reported theft attempts over the last several years has declined as a result of several possible factors: US assistance to improve security at Russian facilities, a possible decrease in smuggling, or smugglers more knowledgeable about evading detection. Nevertheless, we assess that undetected smuggling has occurred, and we are concerned about the total amount of material In contrast, non-weapons-grade nuclear material thefts, particularly containers of such radionuclides as cesium- , cobalt- , or strontium- , have been frequent and well documented. Although terrorists could use these radionuclides to build a radiological dispersal device designed to disperse radioactive material to cause injury and contamination by means of the radiation we assess that in the majority of these cases thieves were seeking the metal used in the container shielding rather than the radioisotope. that could have been diverted over the last years. Safety and Security at Russian Civilian Nuclear Power Plants Russia has announced plans to begin construction of reactors with enhanced safety features, but the funding has not yet been allocated. Consequently Russia will have to extend the lives of the first-generation plants, presenting some risk to the safety of individuals living near them. Seven first-generation Russian nuclear power reactors will reach the end of their service lives within the next four years. A major continuing problem for the Russian nuclear power industry is the failure of its customers to pay for electricity, which has contributed to a lack of resources for maintenance, spare parts, and salaries. Western assistance has been improving the safety systems and operating procedures at Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. However, inherent design deficiencies in RBMK and older model VVER reactors will prevent them from ever meeting Western safety standards. The most notable design flaw in these reactors is the lack of a Western-style containment structure to prevent the release of fission products in the event of a serious accident In March , Atomic Energy Minster Rumyantsev stated that since September We have drawn up and implemented a number of measures which guarantee the necessary safety of our installations. Even with increased security, however, Russian nuclear power plants almost certainly will remain vulnerable to a well- planned and executed terrorist attack, which could cause significant damage or even a radiological release.","Annual Report to Congress on the Safety and Security of Russian Nuclear Facilities and Military Forces December Scope Note Congress has directed the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to submit to the Congressional leadership and intelligence committees an annual, unclassified report assessing the safety and security of the nuclear facilities and military forces in Russia.

In , approximately . kilograms of -percent-enriched weapons-grade uranium were stolen in Moscow. In , the US Government confirmed that a Bulgarian seizure of nuclear material was weapons-usable. The material approximately four grams of HEU probably originated in Russia. Although not independently confirmed, reports of a theft in from an unnamed enterprise in Chelyabinsk Oblast are of concern. The chief of the Federal Security Service department in the Chelyabinsk region reported the prevention of the theft of . kilograms of radioactive materials. Viktor Yerastov, then chief of Minatom s Nuclear Materials Accounting and Control Department, without admitting to an amount being stolen, said that if that amount had been stolen, it was ""quite sufficient material to produce an atomic bomb"" the only nuclear theft that has been so described. There have been other press reports about materials seized in Russia about which we have no further information because Russia typically does not reveal the results of its investigations. Press reports generally overstate the impact of stolen material, often referring to or implying that depleted, natural, or low-enriched uranium are weapons-grade or weapons-usable material. The number of seizures of stolen material and reported theft attempts over the last several years has declined as a result of several possible factors: US assistance to improve security at Russian facilities, a possible decrease in smuggling, or smugglers more knowledgeable about evading detection. Nevertheless, we assess that undetected smuggling has occurred, and we are concerned about the total amount of material In contrast, non-weapons-grade nuclear material thefts, particularly containers of such radionuclides as cesium- , cobalt- , or strontium- , have been frequent and well documented. Although terrorists could use these radionuclides to build a radiological dispersal device designed to disperse radioactive material to cause injury and contamination by means of the radiation we assess that in the majority of these cases thieves were seeking the metal used in the container shielding rather than the radioisotope. that could have been diverted over the last years. Safety and Security at Russian Civilian Nuclear Power Plants Russia has announced plans to begin construction of reactors with enhanced safety features, but the funding has not yet been allocated. Consequently Russia will have to extend the lives of the first-generation plants, presenting some risk to the safety of individuals living near them. Seven first-generation Russian nuclear power reactors will reach the end of their service lives within the next four years. A major continuing problem for the Russian nuclear power industry is the failure of its customers to pay for electricity, which has contributed to a lack of resources for maintenance, spare parts, and salaries. Western assistance has been improving the safety systems and operating procedures at Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. However, inherent design deficiencies in RBMK and older model VVER reactors will prevent them from ever meeting Western safety standards. The most notable design flaw in these reactors is the lack of a Western-style containment structure to prevent the release of fission products in the event of a serious accident In March , Atomic Energy Minster Rumyantsev stated that since September We have drawn up and implemented a number of measures which guarantee the necessary safety of our installations. Even with increased security, however, Russian nuclear power plants almost certainly will remain vulnerable to a well- planned and executed terrorist attack, which could cause significant damage or even a radiological release."
Older Intelligence Products (1999-2015),2006Declassified.pdf,2006: Declassified Key Judgments - Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States (from April 2006 NIE),2006,George W. Bush,Republican,John Negroponte,Director of National Intelligence (ODNI),"Declassified Key Judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States dated April Key Judgments United States-led counterterrorism efforts have seriously damaged the leadership of al-Qa ida and disrupted its operations; however, we judge that al-Qa ida will continue to pose the greatest threat to the Homeland and US interests abroad by a single terrorist organization. We also assess that the global jihadist movement which includes al- Qa ida, affiliated and independent terrorist groups, and emerging networks and cells is spreading and adapting to counterterrorism efforts. Although we cannot measure the extent of the spread with precision, a large body of all-source reporting indicates that activists identifying themselves as jihadists, although a small percentage of Muslims, are increasing in both number and geographic dispersion. If this trend continues, threats to US interests at home and abroad will become more diverse, leading to increasing attacks worldwide. Greater pluralism and more responsive political systems in Muslim majority nations would alleviate some of the grievances jihadists exploit. Over time, such progress, together with sustained, multifaceted programs targeting the vulnerabilities of the jihadist movement and continued pressure on al-Qa ida, could erode support for the jihadists. We assess that the global jihadist movement is decentralized, lacks a coherent global strategy, and is becoming more diffuse. New jihadist networks and cells, with anti- American agendas, are increasingly likely to emerge. The confluence of shared purpose and dispersed actors will make it harder to find and undermine jihadist groups. We assess that the operational threat from self-radicalized cells will grow in importance to US counterterrorism efforts, particularly abroad but also in the Homeland. The jihadists regard Europe as an important venue for attacking Western interests. Extremist networks inside the extensive Muslim diasporas in Europe facilitate recruitment and staging for urban attacks, as illustrated by the Madrid and London bombings. We assess that the Iraq jihad is shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders and operatives; perceived jihadist success there would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere. The Iraq conflict has become the cause celebre for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement. Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves, and be perceived, to have failed, we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight. We assess that the underlying factors fueling the spread of the movement outweigh its vulnerabilities and are likely to do so for the duration of the timeframe of this Estimate. Four underlying factors are fueling the spread of the jihadist movement: ( ) Entrenched grievances, such as corruption, injustice, and fear of Western domination, leading to anger, humiliation, and a sense of powerlessness; ( ) the Iraq jihad; ( ) the slow pace of real and sustained economic, social, and political reforms in many Muslim majority nations; and ( ) pervasive anti-US sentiment among most Muslims all of which jihadists exploit. Concomitant vulnerabilities in the jihadist movement have emerged that, if fully exposed and exploited, could begin to slow the spread of the movement. They include dependence on the continuation of Muslim-related conflicts, the limited appeal of the jihadists radical ideology, the emergence of respected voices of moderation, and criticism of the violent tactics employed against mostly Muslim citizens. The jihadists greatest vulnerability is that their ultimate political solution an ultra-conservative interpretation of shari a-based governance spanning the Muslim world is unpopular with the vast majority of Muslims. Exposing the religious and political straitjacket that is implied by the jihadists propaganda would help to divide them from the audiences they seek to persuade. Recent condemnations of violence and extremist religious interpretations by a few notable Muslim clerics signal a trend that could facilitate the growth of a constructive alternative to jihadist ideology: peaceful political activism. This also could lead to the consistent and dynamic participation of broader Muslim communities in rejecting violence, reducing the ability of radicals to capitalize on passive community support. In this way, the Muslim mainstream emerges as the most powerful weapon in the war on terror. Countering the spread of the jihadist movement will require coordinated multilateral efforts that go well beyond operations to capture or kill terrorist leaders. If democratic reform efforts in Muslim majority nations progress over the next five years, political participation probably would drive a wedge between intransigent extremists and groups willing to use the political process to achieve their local objectives. Nonetheless, attendant reforms and potentially destabilizing transitions will create new opportunities for jihadists to exploit. Al-Qa ida, now merged with Abu Mus ab al-Zarqawi s network, is exploiting the situation in Iraq to attract new recruits and donors and to maintain its leadership role. The loss of key leaders, particularly Usama Bin Ladin, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and al-Zarqawi, in rapid succession, probably would cause the group to fracture into smaller groups. Although like-minded individuals would endeavor to carry on the mission, the loss of these key leaders would exacerbate strains and disagreements. We assess that the resulting splinter groups would, at least for a time, pose a less serious threat to US interests than does al-Qa ida. Should al-Zarqawi continue to evade capture and scale back attacks against Muslims, we assess he could broaden his popular appeal and present a global threat. The increased role of Iraqis in managing the operations of al-Qa ida in Iraq might lead veteran foreign jihadists to focus their efforts on external operations. Other affiliated Sunni extremist organizations, such as Jemaah Islamiya, Ansar al- Sunnah, and several North African groups, unless countered, are likely to expand their reach and become more capable of multiple and/or mass-casualty attacks outside their traditional areas of operation. We assess that such groups pose less of a danger to the Homeland than does al- Qa ida but will pose varying degrees of threat to our allies and to US interests abroad. The focus of their attacks is likely to ebb and flow between local regime targets and regional or global ones. We judge that most jihadist groups both well-known and newly formed will use improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks focused primarily on soft targets to implement their asymmetric warfare strategy, and that they will attempt to conduct sustained terrorist attacks in urban environments. Fighters with experience in Iraq are a potential source of leadership for jihadists pursuing these tactics. CBRN capabilities will continue to be sought by jihadist groups. While Iran, and to a lesser extent Syria, remain the most active state sponsors of terrorism, many other states will be unable to prevent territory or resources from being exploited by terrorists. Anti-US and anti-globalization sentiment is on the rise and fueling other radical ideologies. This could prompt some leftist, nationalist, or separatist groups to adopt terrorist methods to attack US interests. The radicalization process is occurring more quickly, more widely, and more anonymously in the Internet age, raising the likelihood of surprise attacks by unknown groups whose members and supporters may be difficult to pinpoint. We judge that groups of all stripes will increasingly use the Internet to communicate, propagandize, recruit, train, and obtain logistical and financial support.","Declassified Key Judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States dated April Key Judgments United States-led counterterrorism efforts have seriously damaged the leadership of al-Qa ida and disrupted its operations; however, we judge that al-Qa ida will continue to pose the greatest threat to the Homeland and US interests abroad by a single terrorist organization.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence is charged with: Integrating the domestic and foreign dimensions of US intelligence so that there are no gaps in our understanding of threats to our national security; Bringing more depth and accuracy to intelligence analysis; and Ensuring that US intelligence resources generate future capabilities as well as present results. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL Since its formation in , the National Intelligence Council (NIC) has served as a bridge between the intelligence and policy communities, a source of deep substantive expertise on critical national security issues, and as a focal point for Intelligence Community collaboration. The NIC's key goal is to provide policymakers with the best, unvarnished, and unbiased information. Its primary functions are to: Support the DNI in his role as Principal Intelligence Advisor to the President and other senior policymakers. Lead the Intelligence Community's effort to produce National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) and other NIC products that address key national security concerns. Provide a focal point for policymakers, warfighters, and Congressional leaders to task the Intelligence Community for answers to important questions. Reach out to nongovernment experts in academia and the private sector and use alternative analyses and new analytic tools to broaden and deepen the Intelligence Community's perspective. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES AND THE NIE PROCESS National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) are the Intelligence Community s (IC) most authoritative written judgments on national security issues and designed to help US civilian and military leaders develop policies to protect US national security interests. NIEs usually provide information on the current state of play but are primarily estimative that is, they make judgments about the likely course of future events and identify the implications for US policy. The NIEs are typically requested by senior civilian and military policymakers, Congressional leaders, and at times are initiated by the National Intelligence Council (NIC). Before an NIE is drafted, the relevant National Intelligence Officer is responsible for producing a concept paper, or terms of reference (TOR), and circulates it throughout the Intelligence Community for comment. The TOR defines the key estimative questions, determines drafting responsibilities, and sets the drafting and publication schedule. One or more IC analysts are usually assigned to produce the initial text. The NIC then meets to critique the draft before it is circulated to the broader IC. Representatives from the relevant IC agencies meet to hone and coordinate line-by-line the full text of the NIE. Working with their Agencies, representatives also assign the level of confidence they have in key judgments. IC representatives discuss the quality of sources with collectors, and the National Clandestine Service vets the sources used to ensure the draft does not include any that have been recalled or otherwise seriously questioned. All NIEs are reviewed by National Intelligence Board, which is chaired by the DNI and is composed of the heads of relevant IC agencies. Once approved by the NIB, NIEs are briefed to the President and senior policymakers. The whole process of producing NIEs normally takes at least several months. The NIC has undertaken a number of steps to improve the NIE process under the DNI. These steps are in accordance with the goals and recommendations set out in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and WMD Commission reports and the Intelligence Reform and Prevention of Terrorism Act. Most notably, over the last two years the IC has: Created new procedures to integrate formal reviews of source reporting and technical judgments. The Director of CIA, as the National HUMINT Manager, as well as the Directors of NSA, NGA, and DIA and the Assistant Secretary/INR are now required to submit formal assessments that highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and overall credibility of their sources used in developing the critical judgments of the NIE. Applied more rigorous standards. A textbox is incorporated into all NIEs that explains what we mean by such terms as we judge and that clarifies the difference between judgments of likelihood and confidence levels. We have made a concerted effort to not only highlight differences among agencies but to explain the reasons for such differences and to display them prominently in the Key Judgments. S c o p e N o t e This assessment updates the January National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq entitled, Prospects for Iraq s Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead; it has been prepared at the direction of the Director of National Intelligence in response to a request from the National Security Council. It provides the Intelligence Community s analysis of the status of the critical factors identified in the January Estimate that are driving Iraq s security and political trajectory. Using the January Estimate as a baseline, this update examines the prospects for progress on the security and national reconciliation fronts over the next six to months. Analytic Caution: Driven largely by the accelerating pace of tribal engagement and the increasing tempo of Coalition operations, developments in Iraq are unfolding more rapidly and with greater complexity today than when we completed our January NIE. Regional variations in security and political circumstances are great and becoming increasingly more distinct for example, intra-Shia violence in southern Iraq is very different from patterns of violence elsewhere. The intelligence assessments contained in this NIE largely focus on only a short period of the Iraqi conflict the last six months and in circumscribed areas primarily the central provinces, which contain the center of gravity for Iraq s security prospects and in which we have a greater Coalition presence and therefore more information. The unfolding pace and scope of security and political realities in Iraq, combined with our necessarily limited focus of analysis, contain risks: our uncertainties are greater, and our future projections subject to greater chances of error. These issues, combined with the challenges of acquiring accurate data on trends in violence and continued gaps in our information about levels of violence and political trends in areas of Iraq without a substantial Coalition presence and where Intelligence Community collectors have difficulty operating, heighten our caution. Nonetheless, we stand by these judgments as our best collective assessment of security and political conditions in Iraq today and as likely to unfold during the next six to months. HOW THIS ESTIMATEWAS PRODUCED This Estimate followed the standard process for producing National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs), including a thorough review of sourcing, in-depth Community coordination, and consideration of alternative analysis. The NIC circulated a terms of reference (TOR) for the Estimate to IC agencies for review. Analysts from throughout the Community contributed to the draft. A draft was submitted to Intelligence Community (IC) officers in advance of coordination meetings. The National Clandestine Service, FBI, and other IC collection officers reviewed the text for the reliability and proper use of the sourcing. As part of the normal coordination process, analysts had the opportunity and were encouraged to register dissents and provide alternative analysis. The National Intelligence Board, composed of the heads of the IC agencies and chaired by the ODNI, reviewed and approved the Estimate on August. As with other NIEs, it is being distributed to senior Administration officials and Members of Congress. What We Mean When We Say: An Explanation of Estimative Language When we use words such as we judge or we assess terms we use synonymously as well as we estimate, likely or indicate, we are trying to convey an analytical assessment or judgment. These assessments, which are based on incomplete or at times fragmentary information are not a fact, proof, or knowledge. Some analytical judgments are based directly on collected information; others rest on previous judgments, which serve as building blocks. In either type of judgment, we do not have evidence that shows something to be a fact or that definitively links two items or issues. Intelligence judgments pertaining to likelihood are intended to reflect the Community s sense of the probability of a development or event. Assigning precise numerical ratings to such judgments would imply more rigor than we intend. The chart below provides a rough idea of the relationship of terms to each other. We do not intend the term unlikely to imply an event will not happen. We use probably and likely to indicate there is a greater than even chance. We use words such as we cannot dismiss, we cannot rule out, and we cannot discount to reflect an unlikely or even remote event whose consequences are such it warrants mentioning. Words such as may be and suggest are used to reflect situations in which we are unable to assess the likelihood generally because relevant information is nonexistent, sketchy, or fragmented. In addition to using words within a judgment to convey degrees of likelihood, we also ascribe high, moderate, or low confidence levels based on the scope and quality of information supporting our judgments. High confidence generally indicates our judgments are based on high-quality information and/or the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment. Moderate confidence generally means the information is interpreted in various ways, we have alternative views, or the information is credible and plausible but not corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. Low confidence generally means the information is scant, questionable, or very fragmented and it is difficult to make solid analytic inferences, or we have significant concerns or problems with the sources. Key Judgments There have been measurable but uneven improvements in Iraq s security situation since our last National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq in January . The steep escalation of rates of violence has been checked for now, and overall attack levels across Iraq have fallen during seven of the last nine weeks. Coalition forces, working with Iraqi forces, tribal elements, and some Sunni insurgents, have reduced al-Qa ida in Iraq s (AQI) capabilities, restricted its freedom of movement, and denied it grassroots support in some areas. However, the level of overall violence, including attacks on and casualties among civilians, remains high; Iraq s sectarian groups remain unreconciled; AQI retains the ability to conduct high-profile attacks; and to date, Iraqi political leaders remain unable to govern effectively. There have been modest improvements in economic output, budget execution, and government finances but fundamental structural problems continue to prevent sustained progress in economic growth and living conditions. We assess, to the extent that Coalition forces continue to conduct robust counterinsurgency operations and mentor and support the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), that Iraq s security will continue to improve modestly during the next six to months but that levels of insurgent and sectarian violence will remain high and the Iraqi Government will continue to struggle to achieve national-level political reconciliation and improved governance. Broadly accepted political compromises required for sustained security, long-term political progress, and economic development are unlikely to emerge unless there is a fundamental shift in the factors driving Iraqi political and security developments. Political and security trajectories in Iraq continue to be driven primarily by Shia insecurity about retaining political dominance, widespread Sunni unwillingness to accept a diminished political status, factional rivalries within the sectarian communities resulting in armed conflict, and the actions of extremists such as AQI and elements of the Sadrist Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) militia that try to fuel sectarian violence. Two new drivers have emerged since the January Estimate: expanded Sunni opposition to AQI and Iraqi expectation of a Coalition drawdown. Perceptions that the Coalition is withdrawing probably will encourage factions anticipating a power vacuum to seek local security solutions that could intensify sectarian violence and intra-sectarian competition. At the same time, fearing a Coalition withdrawal, some tribal elements and Sunni groups probably will continue to seek accommodation with the Coalition to strengthen themselves for a post- Coalition security environment. Sunni Arab resistance to AQI has expanded in the last six to nine months but has not yet translated into broad Sunni Arab support for the Iraqi Government or widespread willingness to work with the Shia. The Iraqi Government s Shia leaders fear these groups will ultimately side with armed opponents of the government, but the Iraqi Government has supported some initiatives to incorporate those rejecting AQI into Interior Ministry and Defense Ministry elements. Intra-Shia conflict involving factions competing for power and resources probably will intensify as Iraqis assume control of provincial security. In Basrah, violence has escalated with the drawdown of Coalition forces there. Local militias show few signs of reducing their competition for control of valuable oil resources and territory. The Sunni Arab community remains politically fragmented, and we see no prospective leaders that might engage in meaningful dialogue and deliver on national agreements. Kurdish leaders remain focused on protecting the autonomy of the Kurdish region and reluctant to compromise on key issues. The IC assesses that the emergence of bottom-up security initiatives, principally among Sunni Arabs and focused on combating AQI, represent the best prospect for improved security over the next six to months, but we judge these initiatives will only translate into widespread political accommodation and enduring stability if the Iraqi Government accepts and supports them. A multi-stage process involving the Iraqi Government providing support and legitimacy for such initiatives could foster over the longer term political reconciliation between the participating Sunni Arabs and the national government. We also assess that under some conditions bottom-up initiatives could pose risks to the Iraqi Government. We judge such initiatives are most likely to succeed in predominantly Sunni Arab areas, where the presence of AQI elements has been significant, tribal networks and identities are strong, the local government is weak, sectarian conflict is low, and the ISF tolerate Sunni initiatives, as illustrated by Al Anbar Province. Sunni Arab resistance to AQI has expanded, and neighborhood security groups, occasionally consisting of mixed Shia-Sunni units, have proliferated in the past several months. These trends, combined with increased Coalition operations, have eroded AQI s operational presence and capabilities in some areas. Such initiatives, if not fully exploited by the Iraqi Government, could over time also shift greater power to the regions, undermine efforts to impose central authority, and reinvigorate armed opposition to the Baghdad government. Coalition military operations focused on improving population security, both in and outside of Baghdad, will remain critical to the success of local and regional efforts until sectarian fears are diminished enough to enable the Shia-led Iraqi Government to fully support the efforts of local Sunni groups. Iraqi Security Forces involved in combined operations with Coalition forces have performed adequately, and some units have demonstrated increasing professional competence. However, we judge that the ISF have not improved enough to conduct major operations independent of the Coalition on a sustained basis in multiple locations and that the ISF remain reliant on the Coalition for important aspects of logistics and combat support. The deployment of ISF units from throughout Iraq to Baghdad in support of security operations known as Operation Fardh al-Qanun marks significant progress since last year when large groups of soldiers deserted rather than depart their home areas, but Coalition and Iraqi Government support remains critical. Recently, the Iraqi military planned and conducted two joint Army and police large-scale security operations in Baghdad, demonstrating an improving capacity for operational command and control. Militia and insurgent influences continue to undermine the reliability of some ISF units, and political interference in security operations continues to undermine Coalition and ISF efforts. The Maliki government is implementing plans to expand the Iraqi Army and to increase its overall personnel strength to address critical gaps, but we judge that significant security gains from those programs will take at least six to months, and probably longer, to materialize. The IC assesses that the Iraqi Government will become more precarious over the next six to months because of criticism by other members of the major Shia coalition (the Unified Iraqi Alliance, UIA), Grand Ayatollah Sistani, and other Sunni and Kurdish parties. Divisions between Maliki and the Sadrists have increased, and Shia factions have explored alternative coalitions aimed at constraining Maliki. The strains of the security situation and absence of key leaders have stalled internal political debates, slowed national decisionmaking, and increased Maliki s vulnerability to alternative coalitions. We judge that Maliki will continue to benefit from recognition among Shia leaders that searching for a replacement could paralyze the government. Population displacement resulting from sectarian violence continues, imposing burdens on provincial governments and some neighboring states and increasing the danger of destabilizing influences spreading across Iraq s borders over the next six to months. The polarization of communities is most evident in Baghdad, where the Shia are a clear majority in more than half of all neighborhoods and Sunni areas have become surrounded by predominately Shia districts. Where population displacements have led to significant sectarian separation, conflict levels have diminished to some extent because warring communities find it more difficult to penetrate communal enclaves. The IC assesses that Iraq s neighbors will continue to focus on improving their leverage in Iraq in anticipation of a Coalition drawdown. Assistance to armed groups, especially from Iran, exacerbates the violence inside Iraq, and the reluctance of the Sunni states that are generally supportive of US regional goals to offer support to the Iraqi Government probably bolsters Iraqi Sunni Arabs rejection of the government s legitimacy. Over the next year Tehran, concerned about a Sunni reemergence in Iraq and US efforts to limit Iranian influence, will continue to provide funding, weaponry, and training to Iraqi Shia militants. Iran has been intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups of Iraqi Shia militants, particularly the JAM, since at least the beginning of . Explosively formed penetrator (EFP) attacks have risen dramatically. Syria has cracked down on some Sunni extremist groups attempting to infiltrate fighters into Iraq through Syria because of threats they pose to Syrian stability, but the IC now assesses that Damascus is providing support to non-AQI groups inside Iraq in a bid to increase Syrian influence. Turkey probably would use a range of measures to protect what it perceives as its interests in Iraq. The risk of cross-border operations against the People s Congress of Kurdistan (KG) terrorist group based in northern Iraq remains. We assess that changing the mission of Coalition forces from a primarily counterinsurgency and stabilization role to a primary combat support role for Iraqi forces and counterterrorist operations to prevent AQI from establishing a safehaven would erode security gains achieved thus far. The impact of a change in mission on Iraq s political and security environment and throughout the region probably would vary in intensity and suddenness of onset in relation to the rate and scale of a Coalition redeployment. Developments within the Iraqi communities themselves will be decisive in determining political and security trajectories. Recent security improvements in Iraq, including success against AQI, have depended significantly on the close synchronization of conventional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations. A change of mission that interrupts that synchronization would place security improvements at risk.","Prospects for Iraq s Stability: Some Security Progress but Political Reconciliation Elusive Update to NIE, Prospects for Iraq s Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead August OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE The Director of National Intelligence serves as the head of the Intelligence Community (IC), overseeing and directing the implementation of the National Intelligence Program and acting as the principal advisor to the President, the National Security Council, and the Homeland Security Council for intelligence matters.

Provide a focal point for policymakers, warfighters, and Congressional leaders to task the Intelligence Community for answers to important questions. Reach out to nongovernment experts in academia and the private sector and use alternative analyses and new analytic tools to broaden and deepen the Intelligence Community's perspective. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES AND THE NIE PROCESS National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) are the Intelligence Community s (IC) most authoritative written judgments on national security issues and designed to help US civilian and military leaders develop policies to protect US national security interests. NIEs usually provide information on the current state of play but are primarily estimative that is, they make judgments about the likely course of future events and identify the implications for US policy. The NIEs are typically requested by senior civilian and military policymakers, Congressional leaders, and at times are initiated by the National Intelligence Council (NIC). Before an NIE is drafted, the relevant National Intelligence Officer is responsible for producing a concept paper, or terms of reference (TOR), and circulates it throughout the Intelligence Community for comment. The TOR defines the key estimative questions, determines drafting responsibilities, and sets the drafting and publication schedule. One or more IC analysts are usually assigned to produce the initial text. The NIC then meets to critique the draft before it is circulated to the broader IC. Representatives from the relevant IC agencies meet to hone and coordinate line-by-line the full text of the NIE. Working with their Agencies, representatives also assign the level of confidence they have in key judgments. IC representatives discuss the quality of sources with collectors, and the National Clandestine Service vets the sources used to ensure the draft does not include any that have been recalled or otherwise seriously questioned. All NIEs are reviewed by National Intelligence Board, which is chaired by the DNI and is composed of the heads of relevant IC agencies. Once approved by the NIB, NIEs are briefed to the President and senior policymakers. The whole process of producing NIEs normally takes at least several months. The NIC has undertaken a number of steps to improve the NIE process under the DNI. These steps are in accordance with the goals and recommendations set out in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and WMD Commission reports and the Intelligence Reform and Prevention of Terrorism Act. Most notably, over the last two years the IC has: Created new procedures to integrate formal reviews of source reporting and technical judgments. The Director of CIA, as the National HUMINT Manager, as well as the Directors of NSA, NGA, and DIA and the Assistant Secretary/INR are now required to submit formal assessments that highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and overall credibility of their sources used in developing the critical judgments of the NIE. Applied more rigorous standards. A textbox is incorporated into all NIEs that explains what we mean by such terms as we judge and that clarifies the difference between judgments of likelihood and confidence levels. We have made a concerted effort to not only highlight differences among agencies but to explain the reasons for such differences and to display them prominently in the Key Judgments. S c o p e N o t e This assessment updates the January National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq entitled, Prospects for Iraq s Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead; it has been prepared at the direction of the Director of National Intelligence in response to a request from the National Security Council. It provides the Intelligence Community s analysis of the status of the critical factors identified in the January Estimate that are driving Iraq s security and political trajectory. Using the January Estimate as a baseline, this update examines the prospects for progress on the security and national reconciliation fronts over the next six to months. Analytic Caution: Driven largely by the accelerating pace of tribal engagement and the increasing tempo of Coalition operations, developments in Iraq are unfolding more rapidly and with greater complexity today than when we completed our January NIE. Regional variations in security and political circumstances are great and becoming increasingly more distinct for example, intra-Shia violence in southern Iraq is very different from patterns of violence elsewhere. The intelligence assessments contained in this NIE largely focus on only a short period of the Iraqi conflict the last six months and in circumscribed areas primarily the central provinces, which contain the center of gravity for Iraq s security prospects and in which we have a greater Coalition presence and therefore more information. The unfolding pace and scope of security and political realities in Iraq, combined with our necessarily limited focus of analysis, contain risks: our uncertainties are greater, and our future projections subject to greater chances of error. These issues, combined with the challenges of acquiring accurate data on trends in violence and continued gaps in our information about levels of violence and political trends in areas of Iraq without a substantial Coalition presence and where Intelligence Community collectors have difficulty operating, heighten our caution. Nonetheless, we stand by these judgments as our best collective assessment of security and political conditions in Iraq today and as likely to unfold during the next six to months. HOW THIS ESTIMATEWAS PRODUCED This Estimate followed the standard process for producing National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs), including a thorough review of sourcing, in-depth Community coordination, and consideration of alternative analysis. The NIC circulated a terms of reference (TOR) for the Estimate to IC agencies for review. Analysts from throughout the Community contributed to the draft. A draft was submitted to Intelligence Community (IC) officers in advance of coordination meetings. The National Clandestine Service, FBI, and other IC collection officers reviewed the text for the reliability and proper use of the sourcing. As part of the normal coordination process, analysts had the opportunity and were encouraged to register dissents and provide alternative analysis. The National Intelligence Board, composed of the heads of the IC agencies and chaired by the ODNI, reviewed and approved the Estimate on August. As with other NIEs, it is being distributed to senior Administration officials and Members of Congress. What We Mean When We Say: An Explanation of Estimative Language When we use words such as we judge or we assess terms we use synonymously as well as we estimate, likely or indicate, we are trying to convey an analytical assessment or judgment. These assessments, which are based on incomplete or at times fragmentary information are not a fact, proof, or knowledge. Some analytical judgments are based directly on collected information; others rest on previous judgments, which serve as building blocks. In either type of judgment, we do not have evidence that shows something to be a fact or that definitively links two items or issues. Intelligence judgments pertaining to likelihood are intended to reflect the Community s sense of the probability of a development or event. Assigning precise numerical ratings to such judgments would imply more rigor than we intend. The chart below provides a rough idea of the relationship of terms to each other. We do not intend the term unlikely to imply an event will not happen. We use probably and likely to indicate there is a greater than even chance. We use words such as we cannot dismiss, we cannot rule out, and we cannot discount to reflect an unlikely or even remote event whose consequences are such it warrants mentioning. Words such as may be and suggest are used to reflect situations in which we are unable to assess the likelihood generally because relevant information is nonexistent, sketchy, or fragmented. In addition to using words within a judgment to convey degrees of likelihood, we also ascribe high, moderate, or low confidence levels based on the scope and quality of information supporting our judgments. High confidence generally indicates our judgments are based on high-quality information and/or the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment. Moderate confidence generally means the information is interpreted in various ways, we have alternative views, or the information is credible and plausible but not corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. Low confidence generally means the information is scant, questionable, or very fragmented and it is difficult to make solid analytic inferences, or we have significant concerns or problems with the sources. Key Judgments There have been measurable but uneven improvements in Iraq s security situation since our last National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq in January . The steep escalation of rates of violence has been checked for now, and overall attack levels across Iraq have fallen during seven of the last nine weeks. Coalition forces, working with Iraqi forces, tribal elements, and some Sunni insurgents, have reduced al-Qa ida in Iraq s (AQI) capabilities, restricted its freedom of movement, and denied it grassroots support in some areas. However, the level of overall violence, including attacks on and casualties among civilians, remains high; Iraq s sectarian groups remain unreconciled; AQI retains the ability to conduct high-profile attacks; and to date, Iraqi political leaders remain unable to govern effectively. There have been modest improvements in economic output, budget execution, and government finances but fundamental structural problems continue to prevent sustained progress in economic growth and living conditions. We assess, to the extent that Coalition forces continue to conduct robust counterinsurgency operations and mentor and support the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), that Iraq s security will continue to improve modestly during the next six to months but that levels of insurgent and sectarian violence will remain high and the Iraqi Government will continue to struggle to achieve national-level political reconciliation and improved governance. Broadly accepted political compromises required for sustained security, long-term political progress, and economic development are unlikely to emerge unless there is a fundamental shift in the factors driving Iraqi political and security developments. Political and security trajectories in Iraq continue to be driven primarily by Shia insecurity about retaining political dominance, widespread Sunni unwillingness to accept a diminished political status, factional rivalries within the sectarian communities resulting in armed conflict, and the actions of extremists such as AQI and elements of the Sadrist Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) militia that try to fuel sectarian violence. Two new drivers have emerged since the January Estimate: expanded Sunni opposition to AQI and Iraqi expectation of a Coalition drawdown. Perceptions that the Coalition is withdrawing probably will encourage factions anticipating a power vacuum to seek local security solutions that could intensify sectarian violence and intra-sectarian competition. At the same time, fearing a Coalition withdrawal, some tribal elements and Sunni groups probably will continue to seek accommodation with the Coalition to strengthen themselves for a post- Coalition security environment. Sunni Arab resistance to AQI has expanded in the last six to nine months but has not yet translated into broad Sunni Arab support for the Iraqi Government or widespread willingness to work with the Shia. The Iraqi Government s Shia leaders fear these groups will ultimately side with armed opponents of the government, but the Iraqi Government has supported some initiatives to incorporate those rejecting AQI into Interior Ministry and Defense Ministry elements. Intra-Shia conflict involving factions competing for power and resources probably will intensify as Iraqis assume control of provincial security. In Basrah, violence has escalated with the drawdown of Coalition forces there. Local militias show few signs of reducing their competition for control of valuable oil resources and territory. The Sunni Arab community remains politically fragmented, and we see no prospective leaders that might engage in meaningful dialogue and deliver on national agreements. Kurdish leaders remain focused on protecting the autonomy of the Kurdish region and reluctant to compromise on key issues. The IC assesses that the emergence of bottom-up security initiatives, principally among Sunni Arabs and focused on combating AQI, represent the best prospect for improved security over the next six to months, but we judge these initiatives will only translate into widespread political accommodation and enduring stability if the Iraqi Government accepts and supports them. A multi-stage process involving the Iraqi Government providing support and legitimacy for such initiatives could foster over the longer term political reconciliation between the participating Sunni Arabs and the national government. We also assess that under some conditions bottom-up initiatives could pose risks to the Iraqi Government. We judge such initiatives are most likely to succeed in predominantly Sunni Arab areas, where the presence of AQI elements has been significant, tribal networks and identities are strong, the local government is weak, sectarian conflict is low, and the ISF tolerate Sunni initiatives, as illustrated by Al Anbar Province. Sunni Arab resistance to AQI has expanded, and neighborhood security groups, occasionally consisting of mixed Shia-Sunni units, have proliferated in the past several months. These trends, combined with increased Coalition operations, have eroded AQI s operational presence and capabilities in some areas. Such initiatives, if not fully exploited by the Iraqi Government, could over time also shift greater power to the regions, undermine efforts to impose central authority, and reinvigorate armed opposition to the Baghdad government. Coalition military operations focused on improving population security, both in and outside of Baghdad, will remain critical to the success of local and regional efforts until sectarian fears are diminished enough to enable the Shia-led Iraqi Government to fully support the efforts of local Sunni groups. Iraqi Security Forces involved in combined operations with Coalition forces have performed adequately, and some units have demonstrated increasing professional competence. However, we judge that the ISF have not improved enough to conduct major operations independent of the Coalition on a sustained basis in multiple locations and that the ISF remain reliant on the Coalition for important aspects of logistics and combat support. The deployment of ISF units from throughout Iraq to Baghdad in support of security operations known as Operation Fardh al-Qanun marks significant progress since last year when large groups of soldiers deserted rather than depart their home areas, but Coalition and Iraqi Government support remains critical. Recently, the Iraqi military planned and conducted two joint Army and police large-scale security operations in Baghdad, demonstrating an improving capacity for operational command and control. Militia and insurgent influences continue to undermine the reliability of some ISF units, and political interference in security operations continues to undermine Coalition and ISF efforts. The Maliki government is implementing plans to expand the Iraqi Army and to increase its overall personnel strength to address critical gaps, but we judge that significant security gains from those programs will take at least six to months, and probably longer, to materialize. The IC assesses that the Iraqi Government will become more precarious over the next six to months because of criticism by other members of the major Shia coalition (the Unified Iraqi Alliance, UIA), Grand Ayatollah Sistani, and other Sunni and Kurdish parties. Divisions between Maliki and the Sadrists have increased, and Shia factions have explored alternative coalitions aimed at constraining Maliki. The strains of the security situation and absence of key leaders have stalled internal political debates, slowed national decisionmaking, and increased Maliki s vulnerability to alternative coalitions. We judge that Maliki will continue to benefit from recognition among Shia leaders that searching for a replacement could paralyze the government. Population displacement resulting from sectarian violence continues, imposing burdens on provincial governments and some neighboring states and increasing the danger of destabilizing influences spreading across Iraq s borders over the next six to months. The polarization of communities is most evident in Baghdad, where the Shia are a clear majority in more than half of all neighborhoods and Sunni areas have become surrounded by predominately Shia districts. Where population displacements have led to significant sectarian separation, conflict levels have diminished to some extent because warring communities find it more difficult to penetrate communal enclaves. The IC assesses that Iraq s neighbors will continue to focus on improving their leverage in Iraq in anticipation of a Coalition drawdown. Assistance to armed groups, especially from Iran, exacerbates the violence inside Iraq, and the reluctance of the Sunni states that are generally supportive of US regional goals to offer support to the Iraqi Government probably bolsters Iraqi Sunni Arabs rejection of the government s legitimacy. Over the next year Tehran, concerned about a Sunni reemergence in Iraq and US efforts to limit Iranian influence, will continue to provide funding, weaponry, and training to Iraqi Shia militants. Iran has been intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups of Iraqi Shia militants, particularly the JAM, since at least the beginning of . Explosively formed penetrator (EFP) attacks have risen dramatically. Syria has cracked down on some Sunni extremist groups attempting to infiltrate fighters into Iraq through Syria because of threats they pose to Syrian stability, but the IC now assesses that Damascus is providing support to non-AQI groups inside Iraq in a bid to increase Syrian influence. Turkey probably would use a range of measures to protect what it perceives as its interests in Iraq. The risk of cross-border operations against the People s Congress of Kurdistan (KG) terrorist group based in northern Iraq remains. We assess that changing the mission of Coalition forces from a primarily counterinsurgency and stabilization role to a primary combat support role for Iraqi forces and counterterrorist operations to prevent AQI from establishing a safehaven would erode security gains achieved thus far. The impact of a change in mission on Iraq s political and security environment and throughout the region probably would vary in intensity and suddenness of onset in relation to the rate and scale of a Coalition redeployment. Developments within the Iraqi communities themselves will be decisive in determining political and security trajectories. Recent security improvements in Iraq, including success against AQI, have depended significantly on the close synchronization of conventional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations. A change of mission that interrupts that synchronization would place security improvements at risk."

Scope Note Global Food Security: Emerging Technologies to This is not an IC-coordinated report. In July , the National Intelligence Council (NIC) asked Strategic Business Insights (SBI) to identify emerging, potentially breakthrough technologies for agriculture grains, fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish by . This effort was targeted towards agriculture products that can be used for human consumption, animal feed, energy production (biofuels), and other industrial processes (e.g. corn resin). Research was focused on technologies that would impact medium-to-large enterprises in developing and developed countries; not considered were technologies that would be exclusively used in subsistence farming in the underdeveloped world. The developed world is the most likely source of new technology that could be employed in the most advanced agriculture sectors. SBI reviewed their existing publications (Scan, Signals of Change, and Technology Maps) and other open-source material to identify emerging technologies. The timelines implied in the report reflect deployment in the developed world unless specifically stated otherwise. The year was selected as the target end point for this research to enable consideration of longer- term impacts from climate change, growing populations, continued global economic development, and technology development and deployment. This report is the third of four external efforts the NIC will conduct during to explore global food security. The first report Global Food Security: Key Drivers was a conference report introducing the topic of food security. The second report Global Food Security: Market Forces and Selected Case Studies explored market forces that will affect food security to . Finally, the fourth report will be a -plus nations study of global food security and the potential impacts on US national security. Following these external studies, the NIC will lead an Intelligence Community (IC) analytic effort to report on food security and potential impacts on US national security. Food Security Definition The World Food Summit of defined food security as a condition when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life. Commonly, the concept of food security is defined as including both physical and economic access to food that meets people s dietary needs as well as their food preferences.

Global Food Security: Emerging Technologies to Executive Summary Our Bottom Line: Technology will certainly be one of the primary means for improving agricultural productivity necessary to meet the demands of an increasing world population. However, the complex factors that affect productivity do not point to a single or even a handful of new technology innovations that can markedly impact agriculture. The technologies that will have the largest impact on agricultural productivity in the next years include the use of existing genetically modified crops, soil and water management, pest control, and post-harvest processing. By , the tools and advances of molecular biology applied to plants, livestock, and microorganisms will most likely have the greatest impact on agricultural production. The principal challenge facing world agriculture is finding the means of increasing agricultural productivity producing more with fewer resources (land, fertilizer, water, and pesticides) to meet the demands of an increasing world population. However, the complex factors that affect productivity do not point to a single or even a handful of new technology innovations that can markedly impact agriculture. The application of existing technologies (genetically modified crops, soil and water management, pest control, and post-harvest processing) will have the largest impact on agricultural productivity in the next years. By , the tools and advances of molecular biology applied to plants, livestock, and microorganisms will most likely have the greatest impact on agricultural production. Out to the extent of development and deployment of new technologies will be varied among the different agriculture sectors grains, livestock, water and soil management, aquaculture, precision agriculture, biofuels, and post-harvest processing. Grains. The productivity of the grain segment of the agricultural industry is key to meeting global food demands. To meet the food needs of the world population in , the agricultural sector will have to produce an additional billion tons of grain per year, which is roughly a - percent increase over the production of . billion tons in . With the molecular biology tools now available, plant breeders will possibly be able to achieve grain yields sufficient to meet world population grain needs in . o The advances in plant genomics come at a cost to the farmer. The cost of genetically transformed seed can be five to seven times higher than conventional seed. Livestock. Similar to plants, livestock breeding is taking advantage of the developments in molecular biology to accelerate development of highly productive and healthy animals. Genetic analysis of animals through molecular biology has also improved the quality of livestock agriculture. Water and Soil Management. Because agriculture consumes percent of the O F F I C E O F T H E D I R E C T O R O F N A T I O N A L I N T E L L I G E N C E A T A I O R E C T C E D I N L O F F I C I G E N This paper does not represent US Government views. ii This paper does not represent US Government views. freshwater supply, and percent of the world s agriculture depends on irrigation, any sustained increase in agricultural productivity by will require efficient water management. To be more efficient, some farmers in developed countries are applying subsurface drip irrigation. This technology has higher installation costs than conventional surface irrigation but will likely become the norm by . Most of the fertilizer technology in use today was developed in the s through the s. Because publicly funded fertilizer research has mostly ceased, significant development and deployment of new and more efficient fertilizers and fertilizer manufacturing technologies will not likely occur between now and . Aquaculture. Demand for aquaculture will continue to grow to meet the world s demand for protein. Based on a World Bank report, aquaculture producers will likely see growth rates ranging from . percent to . percent per year in the next to years. The key technologies required to produce this growth are all feasible today. Precision Agriculture. Because of its history, precision agriculture the use of soil sensors and geolocation technologies for planting, watering, feeding, and harvesting is bound up heavily with the large-scale industrial- agriculture practices. They predominate in regions like the midwestern United States, southern Brazil, and parts of Canada, Germany, and Australia. For precision agriculture technologies to diffuse on a wide scale in the future they will need to scale down to work well for small plots in the developing world where the greatest potential productivity gains can be made. Biofuels. Over the next several decades, a transition to next-generation technologies that convert biomass (rather than food crops) to advanced biofuels and chemicals will be essential to improve the security and affordability of the world s food supplies. Developers are just beginning to scale up the new biofuel technologies to commercial production and still face significant technical and financial risks. Post-Harvest Processing. Most of the technologies deployed in the post-harvest processing sector are mature and reasonably effective. Application of existing irradiation technology could reduce crop losses that can be as high as percent in developing countries. However, the technology has met with public resistance to its application because of fear the basic food properties will be altered. Currently many of the biotechnologies that have been commercialized face resistance from the public and regulatory agencies. This is because of concerns that pollen from the genetically modified plants will spread the transformation to non-transformed plants in nearby fields and that genetically modified foods will be harmful to human health. In addition, for many of the emerging technologies to be deployed globally, they will have to be adapted to the mix of commodities produced, production practices, and environmental conditions of different localities. Local implementation might require additional factors such as investments in agricultural research at the developing-country level as well as in agricultural human capital and infrastructure. Further, agricultural productivity improvements will require advances in other fields beyond molecular biology, including chemistry, electrical engineering, remote sensing, and computer science. The tools from these fields are not necessarily developed specifically for agriculture, but their application can make improvements in controlling the management of soil, water, crop, and energy inputs to agriculture.

Discussion Introduction and Background The principal challenge facing world agriculture is finding the means of increasing agricultural productivity producing more with fewer resources (land, fertilizer, water, and pesticides) to meet the demands of an increasing world population. Technology will certainly be one of the primary tools for accomplishing agricultural productivity improvements, but the complex factors that affect productivity do not point to a single or even a handful of new technology innovations that can markedly impact agriculture. Although plant breeding was the key technology of the highly successful Green Revolution between the s and the late s, other technologies fertilizer, water management, and pest control were among those required to achieve the phenomenal increases in agricultural productivity experienced in developing countries from to the late s. Similarly a combination of technological innovations will likely be required to achieve future increases in agricultural productivity and product quality. The primary goal of the application of technology is increased agricultural productivity. Improving nutrition of agricultural products is the secondary goal. The technologies that will have the largest impact on agricultural productivity in the next years include the use of existing genetically modified crops, soil and water management, pest control, and post-harvest processing. Molecular biology applications to plants and animals are the technology advances most likely to have the greatest impact on agricultural productivity by . Enhancing plant and animal traits by the conventional methods of cross-pollination, grafting, and cross- breeding is a slow trial-and-error process. Advances in molecular biology provide a means of making specific changes relatively quickly through over-expression or deletion of genes or the introduction of foreign genes. The advances in plant molecular biology are supplementing the classical plant genetics used in the Green Revolution to improve plant productivity. The developments stemming from advances in animal molecular biology are supplementing conventional breeding practices to improve livestock productivity. The developments of molecular biology can lead to more effective plant and animal breeding by examining the entire genome of all organisms for potential improvements to crops and livestock. Emerging Technologies Grains The productivity of the grain segment of the agricultural industry is key to meeting global food demands. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that to meet the food needs of the world population in , the agricultural sector will have to produce an additional billion tons of grain per year, which is roughly a -percent increase over the production of . billion tons in .

This paper does not represent US Government views. With the molecular biology tools now available, plant breeders will possibly be able to achieve grain yields sufficient to meet world population food needs through to . Although many agricultural products are grown, grain crops are the most important source of food in the world. Grains are used not only for direct human consumption but also for the production of livestock and biofuels. From to , annual cereal production increased by percent from million to . billion tons even though the hectares under cultivation increased by only percent. Over those five decades, the average grain yield for the world increased from . to . metric tons/hectare (see chart on facing page). Technology advances resulting from the Green Revolution that were introduced in the s more than doubled the yield and added more than a billion tons of all grain types to the world food supply. As the graphic on the previous page shows, the rate of increase in grain yield from the advances spurred by the Green Revolution is tapering off. This indicates that yield increases through will require some new technological advances to assure the needed - percent increase in grain production. The graphic at the bottom of the previous page shows the yield and yield growth rates for different world regions. The similar annual growth rates indicate the introduction of technological advances during the Green Revolution in most of the regions. The growth rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is lower because the advances during the Green Revolution were not adapted to the different soil, climate, and geomorphic conditions of that region. Furthermore, economic conditions within the region did not support the investment in new technologies. The Rest of the World includes mostly the developed countries, and the difference in yield indicates that there is potential for some increase in the other regions. Geneticists have developed specialized seeds by mapping plant DNA that can improve the control of crops by increasing yield with fewer inputs. As biotechnology tools develop through , the cost of conducting transgenic research projects will probably decrease substantially and the productivity of transgenic plants will spread from developed countries to developing countries. Although the cost of identifying a gene in a single plant was $ a few years ago, it now is about $ . and developments now taking place could reduce this to $ for one million genes. By gene identification might become routine and no longer a significant plant development hurdle. Molecular breeding in plants will likely accelerate the commercialization of new plant cultivars that have higher grain yields and better agronomic traits. The cost of gene sequencing and mapping is steadily declining to the point where these technologies will likely become routine by . Drought- tolerant maize, which received regulatory approval by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and European Commission, is an example of the application of marker-assisted selection technology that accelerates the plant breeding process. Transgenic plant technology has advanced remarkably with a number of technical breakthroughs in pesticide and herbicide resistance. However, its application has been slowed because of public and regulatory concerns about the potential harmful effects of the technology. It is unlikely to be fully developed and deployed by . The advances in plant genomics come at a cost to the farmer. The cost of genetically Transgenic technologies transfer genes with specific traits from one species or organism into another species or organism. A cultivar is a plant or group of plants selected for desirable characteristics that can be maintained by propagation. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. transformed seed can be five to seven times higher than conventional seed. However, based on US experience, herbicide and pesticide- resistant crops pay off. In , percent of the corn crop and percent of the soybean crop in the United States were genetically transformed. As efficiencies in developing genetically transformed crops continue to increase to , the economic advantages of using these crops will also increase. Livestock Similar to plants, livestock breeding is taking advantage of the developments in molecular biology to accelerate development of highly productive and healthy animals. Genetic analysis of animals through molecular biology has also improved the quality of livestock. Transgenic technology provides the means of inserting a desirable gene or set of genes from one animal species to another. E. coli, transgenically modified with the genes from a cow that generate the hormone bovine somatotropin (BST), produces BST by fermentation. The injection of transgenic BST into dairy cows enhances the production of milk and is now widely used in US dairy farming. Marker-assisted selection, another use of advanced molecular biology, gives scientists the tools to identify genes that can enhance beneficial traits in livestock. These include controlled growth rate, resistance to disease, tolerance of heat and cold conditions, lower cholesterol in eggs, and an increased lean-to-fat ratio in pigs. Water and Soil Management Besides solar radiation and soil, agriculture depends on two other major inputs water and fertilizer. Over the last few decades, half the increases in yield resulted from increased use of fertilizer and irrigation. Because agriculture consumes percent of the freshwater supply, and percent of the world s agriculture depends on irrigation, any sustained increase in agricultural productivity by will require efficient water management. Current irrigation practices waste percent of the water drawn from freshwater sources. Because water scarcity can limit the productivity of major agricultural crops, some farmers in developed countries are applying subsurface drip irrigation technology. However, the technology has higher installation costs than conventional surface irrigation. As the price of water used for agriculture rises in response to increased demand for scarce water resources, subsurface drip irrigation, because of its high water efficiency, will likely become the norm by . Advanced drip-irrigations systems, vapor- transfer irrigation, and hydroponic greenhouse technologies are being developed and employed to enhance the efficiency of water utilization in agriculture. Drought-tolerant and salt-tolerant plants, which are being developed by using molecular biology techniques, employ emerging technologies that can reduce the consumption of freshwater sources. Global fertilizer consumption per hectare had an annual increase of . percent in the s and is projected to grow . percent annually from to . Most of the fertilizer technology in use today was developed in the s through the s. Because publicly funded fertilizer research has mostly ceased, significant development and deployment of new and more efficient fertilizers and fertilizer manufacturing technologies will not likely occur between now and . Research work currently underway focuses on agronomic efficiency and minimization of environmental impacts from fertilizer use. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. A breakthrough achievement would be the genetic alteration of non-legume plants so that they could convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into ammonia and greatly reduce the need for chemically synthesized fertilizer. The large number of genes involved in the symbiotic relationship between soil microorganisms and legumes results in a very complex problem that has only achieved a glimmer of scientific insight at this time. Research is progressing in this field, however by farmers will likely still be using conventional plant nutrient approaches. Aquaculture As an excellent source of affordable, high-quality animal protein, fish accounted for approximately percent of the global population s intake of animal protein in and approximately percent of all protein consumed. As the fastest growing animal-food-producing sector, aquaculture the growing of aquatic animals and plants contributed percent of total food fish consumption in , up from less than percent in . It will soon account for more than half of the world s supply of food fish. Major increases in aquaculture productivity through the entire production and distribution cycle have driven this growth. Prices of many aquaculture products, including large-quantity products like carp and tilapia, have fallen steadily over the last years. Demand for aquaculture will continue to grow to meet the world s demand for protein. Based on a World Bank report, aquaculture producers will likely see growth rates ranging from . percent to . percent per year in the next to years. The key technologies required to produce this growth all of which are feasible are genetically improved fish, new feed and feeding practices, closed recirculating systems, and open ocean systems (large cages in deep-ocean waters). Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture supported by information technology is increasingly employed by farmers. These technologies allow farmers to precisely control crop and livestock production. Existing precision agriculture techniques tend to focus on discovering how factors like soil quality, water availability, and drainage patterns vary within a single field. They are then used to adapt planting, harvesting, and management strategies to address those variations. Because of its history, precision agriculture is bound up heavily with the large-scale industrial-agriculture practices. They predominate in regions like the midwestern United States, southern Brazil, and parts of Canada, Germany, and Australia. For precision agriculture technologies to diffuse on a wide scale in the future and in a manner that will have a substantial impact on global food production and resource consumption, the kinds of automated systems that are emerging on large farm vehicles will have to decrease in size and price. They will also need to scale down to work well for small plots in the developing world where the greatest potential productivity gains can be made. Biofuels The use of biofuels primarily ethanol and biodiesel for transportation has grown rapidly worldwide. However, according to many government, academic, and industry experts, today s biofuels have drawbacks. They provide little environmental benefit, consume food crops, and are expensive. US corn-based ethanol production reached billion gallons in , but consumed nearly percent of the US corn crop while supplying only percent of US gasoline demand. By , a transition to next- generation technologies that convert biomass (rather than food crops) to advanced biofuels and chemicals will be essential to improve the security and affordability of the world s food This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. supplies. Such a transition would also reduce global dependence on petroleum fuels. Developers are just beginning to scale up the new biofuel technologies to commercial production and face significant technical and financial risks. One of the biggest drivers of advanced biofuels is government policies. Both the United States and the European Union have aggressive biofuel regulations in place that include sustainability standards. We do not know yet whether nations will be able to meet their targets for producing advanced biofuels using nonfood crop feedstocks. The long-term viability of advanced biofuels depends on relative prices for competing petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuels. In addition, very high-efficiency vehicle technology, including hybrid and pure electric vehicles and hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles, will help to reduce fossil-fuel use and carbon emissions and thus will also compete with advanced biofuels. Post-Harvest Processing Post-harvest losses of grain are to percent. Fruit and vegetable losses can be as high as percent in developing countries and as low as percent in developed countries. Post-harvest research receives only about percent of the total agriculture Research and Development (R&D) funding. Most of the technologies deployed in The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires percent of transportation energy from renewable energy by and that the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels consumed be at least percent less than the equivalent emissions from gasoline or diesel by (and percent less starting in ). Also, the feedstocks for biofuels ""should not be harvested from lands with high biodiversity value, from carbon- rich or forested land, or from wetlands."" The US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires at least half of the biofuels production mandated by should reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by percent. this sector are mature and reasonably effective. Existing irradiation technology might reduce losses substantially, but the technology, like transgenics, has met with public resistance to its application. FAO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been active in regulating food irradiation. Through more than countries had allowed the use of food irradiation on at least one product. Since the technology is already dispersing throughout the world, it might have a bigger role by in disinfestations and shelf-life extension. Preparing for the Long Haul Technological innovation in agriculture is complicated by the multiplicity of parameters that affect the productivity of crop or animal herds. This means that no one breakthrough technology can assure an increase in the productivity of world agriculture. Improvements in plant and animal genetics need to be cost-effectively integrated with new technologies in the management of pests and diseases, soil, animal nutrition, and water. Furthermore these technology developments have to be adapted to a wide variety of local agricultural conditions. For many of the emerging technologies to be deployed globally they will have to be adapted to the mix of commodities produced, production practices, and environmental conditions of different localities. Global research efforts of USDA and the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR) are critical to lifting global production. Local implementation might require additional factors such as investments in agricultural research at the developing- country level as well as in agricultural human capital and infrastructure. The rapid advances in molecular biology are providing the tools to delve into the complexities of plant and animal traits. These This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Technology Hurdles Assessing how new technologies will affect agricultural productivity includes an examination of the hurdles to their adoption. Currently many of the biotechnologies that have been commercialized face resistance throughout the world from the public and regulatory agencies. Transgenic technologies that have produced pest-resistant corn, genetic transformation of crops for herbicide resistance, and bovine somatotropin (BST) produced by genetic engineering have all been banned in some parts of the world. If public and regulatory resistance continues through to , the pace of agricultural productivity gains will slow down. The cost of introducing new technologies into agriculture might also limit their widespread application. Although transgenic technology research is an ongoing activity in many agricultural research institutions, application in a particular region is quite costly. For example, the Insect Resistant Maize for Africa (IRMA) project cost $ million over a five-year period, and a transgenic sweet potato research project cost $ million. Annex J shows the cost of US production of corn, soybeans, and wheat. The higher cost of seed for genetically engineered crops will probably come down by , but until the prices do come down, there will be a slow application of genetically engineered crops in developing countries where grain yields are in need of the most improvement. The more complex wheat genome and its relatively lower economic value have also hindered the development of genetically engineered wheat and will likely continue to do so. Although precision agriculture is at an early stage in developed farm economies, its potential for increased widespread deployment by may be limited. The present capital recovery costs for the three crops shown in Annex J account for to percent of the production cost. Precision agriculture would likely add considerably to these existing costs, and it may be that the yield increases with this added technology cannot compensate for the added costs. advances have already had significant impacts on agricultural productivity and are likely to continue providing improvements in agricultural practices. However, to examine the impact of emerging technology on agriculture, one needs to look beyond the advances in molecular biology to other fields including chemistry, electrical engineering, remote sensing, and computer science. The tools from these fields are not necessarily developed specifically for agriculture, but their application can make improvements in controlling the management of soil, water, crops, and energy inputs.

Annex A Emerging Technologies for Crop Productivity Improvement As occurred during the Green Revolution, the most likely technology breakthroughs to appear in agriculture through will likely come from plant breeding to improve desired plant traits. The difference in plant breeding now as opposed to or more years ago is the availability of the tools based on molecular biology, which have provided many insights into the genetic makeup of plants and its relationship to important agronomic traits related to plant productivity. Plant scientists use these molecular biology tools, most of which have been developed in the medical sciences, to introduce desirable agronomic traits in plants. The molecular biology tools include rapid sequencing, gene cloning, gene mapping, recombinant DNA, polymerase chain reaction, and biochips. In addition, bioinformatics, which uses applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, chemistry, and biochemistry, is essential to making the plant breeding process much more efficient. Historically crop improvement has been done by selecting the best performing plants or seeds and using them for planting in the following year. As genetic science becomes better, plant breeding will be done by modifying the genetic composition of a plant through cross breeding, then selecting plants that exhibit improved traits. Conventional plant breeding has limits in that it can be applied only to plants that sexually mate, limiting traits that already exist in a species. Additionally when plants are crossed, traits besides the one of interest are transferred, some of which might negatively impact the desired trait or the yield potential of the plant. Molecular biology for crop improvement has two approaches: Gene technology converts the conventional breeding process to a molecular plant breeding process. The tools of molecular biology have produced a major breakthrough in plant breeding by using gene technology to identify the genetic origin of a trait or group of traits. This technology can accelerate the process of developing improved plant cultivars from two or three decades long to less than a single decade. Transgenic technology transfers the genes from other plant species or organisms into the genome of a plant. Transgenic technology allows a single trait from any living organism to be introduced into a plant. This technology enables the introduction of new traits not found in a particular species of plant that can provide agronomic benefits. Molecular Crop Breeding Technology Numerous molecular biology tools are used in modern plant breeding technology. By and large, these technologies have been developed in the medical sciences. The technologies flowing from the Human This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Genome Project , which was sponsored by the US Government, have been essential elements of molecular crop breeding. Gene Sequencing determines the nucleotide sequence of the entire DNA in a genome. It is a formidable task with the genome of maize having . billion base pairs of DNA in , genes in chromosomes. Scientists have also sequenced the genomes of rice, sorghum, cassava, and poplar, and the sequencing of other plants is underway. Because highly automated sequencing innovations are simplifying the task and reducing the cost, sequencing of a particular species of plant by might become a routine task costing only thousands of dollars. The research effort on maize conducted at Washington University in cost approximately $ million. Automated sequencing instruments now have the capability of generating million DNA base pairs per day. Annotated Plant Genomes follows the completion of gene sequencing. Annotation is the process in which the DNA sequences are analyzed to determine a gene location in the chromosome, the gene structure (open reading frames, exons, introns, and regulating regions), and gene function (the role of gene products and regulatory features). By using the existing genomes in databases, e.g., Arabidopsis and rice, as models, the annotation of a particular crop in an agricultural region can be more rapidly developed. By , the complete sequences of many crops will likely be known, all genes will be identified, alleles (variants) of important genes will be known, and the association of relevant genes with traits will be established to increase yield or establish other important agronomic characteristics. Proteomics complements DNA technology. Because DNA sequences alone are not sufficient for understanding how genes are transcribed and translated into functional proteins, another emerging technology derived from molecular biology proteomics provides a tool for further annotation of the structural and functional characteristics of a genome. The direct identification and quantification of the proteins from a genome has been made possible by advances in chromatography, electrospray ionization of peptides, tandem mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, and computer technology. These technologies have enabled the monitoring of , or more proteins of whole plants with reproducible quantitative comparison of different samples. Peptide mass spectrometry has the ability of identifying single amino acid polymorphisms derived from alleles, which facilitates the detection of genetic markers. DNA Markers are sequences of DNA known to be related to particular genes or traits. Using marker assisted breeding to determine the best cross breeding and progeny shortens the time of having a crop cultivar with improved characteristics by two to five years when the relationship of a gene variant to a trait is known, then the variant gene can be used as a marker of that trait. A plant for cross breeding can then be identified by the presence of the marker in its genome without the need of testing for the expression of a trait. This helps the selection of diverse parents for development of a specific trait and reduces the number of breeding generations. Although great strides have been made by geneticists in locating on genetic maps the loci linked to a particular trait using genetic markers, the measurement of phenotypes (observable characteristics such as morphology, crop or product development, biochemical or physiological properties, and product composition) nevertheless remains a lengthy process. Plant breeders need to assess hundreds of thousands of progeny from many plant crossings in multiple environments to show which loci on a The Human Genome Project matured technologies, instrumentation, and robotics for more efficient DNA sequencing. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. chromosome move together in heritable associations (haplotypes). Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) technology is a method that can reduce the effort required to establish gene-trait associations. QTL analysis uses the statistical frequencies of alleles to indicate the relationship between chromosome loci and quantitative or continuous traits. These associations have been extensively analyzed on multiple species (rice, maize, and other crops); results can help infer gene-trait relationships in other crops. Another technique that could add efficiency in identifying gene-trait relationships is functional genomics, which examines the dynamic aspects of genomics. In plants, manipulating or adding genes and then examining the effects on a trait has the potential of identifying genes that regulate a trait. Induced Mutation Breeding is a technology that has been used since the s for creating genetic variation of traits for crop improvement. Plant breeding requires genetic variation, but natural variation is limited and genes with a desired trait might not be in the gene pool. To induce genetic variation, mutagenic agents, such as radiation or certain chemicals, are used on seeds from which mutants with desired properties can be selected. Before the tools of molecular biology and plant cell culture became available, the selection of desirable mutants was tedious and took many years of observing multiple generations of field plantings. These new tools have moved much of the work from the field to the laboratory. Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genomes (TILLING) is an approach to accelerate the plant breeding process by inducing mutations in known genes in large populations of plants, which are then screened for mutations with the high-throughput genetic analysis tools of molecular biology. Crop improvement fundamentally depends on identifying genetic variation in crops. The emerging technology advances resulting from the Human Genome Project that relate human genetic characteristics to healthcare needs are transferable to crop improvement needs. Applying the tools of molecular biology to plant breeding is leading to an extensive understanding of the variations (alleles) in every gene in a plant so that the genetic diversity of equivalent segments (haplotypes) in a crop germplasm would provide the ability to select efficiently and rapidly parent plants and subsequent progeny. Key traits such as drought tolerance and long-lasting resistance to diseases and pests, however, are complex and involve many genes. Gaining that level of understanding requires a Systems Biology approach in which the dynamic interaction among proteins, metabolites, biochemical pathways, and signaling pathways are analyzed in an integrated fashion. This requires progress in computer modeling to guide experimental observations. The search for higher productivity in crops, including the understanding of these complex traits and the application of a systems approach, might be one of the ways of gaining the needed breakthroughs by . Transgenic Crop Technology To avoid limitation to the natural and induced genetic variations of a crop, scientists have developed transgenic technologies in which traits from other plant species or organisms are inserted into a crop genome. Herbicide resistance and insect resistance are commercialized seed products of transgenic plant technology in common use. A gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that produces a toxin to kill insect pests has been inserted by recombinant DNA technology into the genome of maize, cotton, and potato, resulting in higher yields and requiring fewer chemical pesticide applications. By inserting a gene from Agrobacterium that produces enzymes resistant to glyphosate, a common herbicide, scientists have used recombinant DNA technology to develop herbicide-resistant crops that make weed control more efficient. Herbicide-resistant soybean, maize, canola, sugar beet and cotton are all commercialized and herbicide-resistant wheat and alfalfa are under development. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. The transgenic development process requires a plant to go through seven steps before its modified form becomes commercialized: DNA extraction from a desired organism. Gene cloning by separating the single gene of interest from the extracted DNA and using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology to produce many copies of the gene. Gene design by modifying the gene to function in the crop plant cells using new promoter and termination sequences and adding a marker gene for antibiotic resistance. Gene insertion into the nucleus of cells of a callus tissue of the crop plant by Agrobacterium, using a gene gun or microporation technology. Propagation of the plant in tissue culture in a medium containing an antibiotic so that only the transformed callus tissue can grow into a plant. Maturation of the transgenic plants in a greenhouse and collection of the seeds. Backcross breeding to combine the desired traits of the parents with transgenic plant to produce a single line with the offspring crossed back with the parent elite line until a high yielding transgenic line is produced. About to years are needed for the transgenic line to be commercialized. Hundreds of known transgenes can affect the traits of crop plants, but few have been commercialized. As more fundamental knowledge is developed about plant genomics and the dynamics of plant cells, those transgenes that affect crop productivity will be applied. Researchers are developing technologies that can refine the process for applying transgenes to agronomic problems: Directed Evolution of Genes. Laboratory techniques have been developed to shuffle domains of genes or to generate random mutations in gene sequences that can alter enzymes or proteins encoded by these genes. This approach has been used to alter Rubisco, an enzyme in plants that converts carbon dioxide to biological molecules, and enhance photosynthesis and plant growth. This approach has also been proposed for altering Bt to provide toxicity in plants to specific pests. Gene Silencing. The discovery that small RNA molecules are active in plant development and resistant to stress has led to the examination of RNA Interference (RNAi) technology. Although at an early stage of research, researchers can design and overexpress (enhance the functionality of) genes encoding RNAs that target pests or pathogens. Likewise, researchers can silence genes that are unique to pests or pathogens and as a result the pests and pathogens cannot survive. This technology has shown some promise in control of bollworm in cotton. Metabolic Pathway Engineering. As the understanding of metabolic pathways in plants increases, transgenically enabled traits will become more common. An example of this technology currently underway is Golden Rice, a rice that contains carotene as a means of producing a fortified food for areas deficient in foodstuffs containing Vitamin A. The technology involves three transgenes one from bacteria, one from maize, and one from a daffodil. The combination of these genes gives a metabolic pathway that produces beta-carotene (Vitamin A precursor). This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Site-Specific Gene Insertion. Current transgenic practice inserts genes into a plant chromosome at random, which leads to large variations in expression of traits and the need to screen hundreds of transgenic plants to determine the optimum insertion. If one allele could be replaced by another at a specific site in a homologous recombination, then the process of plant improvement would be greatly enhanced because it enables the study of functions of specific genes. Homologous recombination requires a double strand break in a chromosome. Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) technology enables a method for making precise double-strand breaks in chromosomes for a homologous recombination of an allele. Different zinc finger nucleases can be engineered to specifically make a break at a particular gene. In addition to ZNF technology, other enzymes can be used that are capable of recombining two identical specific sequences. This technology can be used to stack multiple transgenes at a target site to provide several new traits to a plant. Single transgene insertions have been performed in rice, wheat, and corn. Artificial Chromosomes. Ultimately crop improvement will require stacking the best alleles for important genes into a single plant variety at a single locus so that the transgenes do not segregate in later generations. Although homologous recombination and site-specific gene insertion provide this capability, artificial chromosomes might be a more efficient method. The process consists of synthesizing a mini-chromosome by linking genes of interest and forming a singular loop of DNA. The artificial chromosomes are then inserted into plant cells by particle bombardment. In experiments with maize, the artificial chromosomes were regularly inherited in up to percent of the plant offspring after three generations. The technology has the capability of stacking up to ten genes. Syngenta Biotechnology and Monsanto have both formed partnerships with the inventing company, Chromatin. Because about genes are involved in nitrogen fixation, artificial chromosome technology might be a route to install nitrogen fixation capabilities in non-legume crops like rice, wheat, and maize. Apomixis. Because hybrid seeds are more expensive than seeds saved from a previous harvest, farmers might chose not to use them, even though they have higher yields and greater resistance to pests and diseases. If the performance of hybrid seeds could be maintained from one harvest to the next, the cost of seed would be considerably reduced. In some wild plant species, a hybrid genotype is preserved through apomixes, which is a process by which progeny seed are produced in a plant without sexual fertilization. Research is underway to see if transgenes can be designed to change the mode of plant seed production from sexual fertilization to apomixes. Signals of Plant Stress. Research has shown that transgenes can be designed and inserted in a plant that responds to stress and provides an observable signal indicating deficiencies in soil or water or early-stage disease. A signal such as a pigment change produced by the plant at an early stage in its development could give the farmer time to take corrective action to preserve the productivity of the crop. Biocontrol Technology Although most farmers use pesticides and herbicides or genetically engineered plants for pest and weed control, biocontrol technology is an alternative that has also been used. Biocontrol consists of releasing a specific natural enemy (parasites, predators, or naturally occurring pathogens) to control invasive weeds and insect pests, nematodes, and plant pathogens. This technology requires extensive research of a particular pest in a particular region and for a particular crop. The United States Department of This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Agriculture (USDA) and a number of universities have biocontrol research programs aimed at specific pests. The USDA biocontrol projects include control of Asian citrus plant lice with a parasitoid, control of rangeland grasshoppers with fungal pathogens, and control of the Russian knapweed with a gall midge. The EU Specific Targeted Research Project is studying the enhancement and exploitation of soil biocontrol agents for bio-constraint management in crops. The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization have an extensive list of biological control agents that are widely used in the member countries. Although biocontrol technology has been used for many decades, it might have an increasing impact in the future as concerns about the use of chemical pesticides increases. Biocontrol is a component of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which is a process for managing a pest problem that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical controls that minimize economic, safety, and environmental risks. Farmers currently use some aspects of integrated pest management and will probably include more of its elements as knowledge gained from molecular biology of pests and weeds increases, and the advantages of using less pesticide and herbicides increase. Application of molecular biology has been proposed by scientists around the world as a means of making biocontrol and biopesticides more effective by improving their success rate, robustness, and reliability. Genetic engineering could enhance the speed of pest kill, reduce the initial amount of biocontrol agent required, and enhance persistence of the agents. This technology is at a very early stage of development. As an example of its potential, scientists at the Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences and the University of Maryland increased the virulence of an insecticidal fungus by using a transgene from a scorpion that expresses an insect-specific neurotoxin. The genetically engineered fungus had its toxicity to the tobacco hornworm increased fold. Other research has demonstrated genetically engineered hypervirulent viruses and fungi as controls of pests and weeds. However since genetically engineered biocontrol is still in the early stages, it will not likely have a measurable impact on agriculture by . This paper does not represent US Government views.

Annex B Emerging Technologies for Livestock Breeding and Health In a process similar to plant breeding and protection, the advances in molecular biology are having an important impact on livestock management. For centuries, livestock breeders have been observing variation of traits in breeding animals and selecting those with genetically superior traits, such as growth rate, quality/quantity of products (milk, meat, eggs), fertility, survival in different environments, and disease resistance. Worldwide in there were cattle breeds, sheep breeds, pig breeds, and about , chicken breeds. The selective animal breeding process takes several decades to reach a highly productive livestock pedigree. Through a lengthy process, animal breeding has proved to be successful as exemplified by the three-fold increase in milk yield from dairy cattle over a period of years without any knowledge of the relationship between genes and traits. The emerging use of genomic information, however, will likely increase the efficiency of the breeding process as well as enhance the health of livestock by . Marker-Assisted Selection Technology in Livestock Breeding Genome sequencing of economically important livestock has been proceeding rapidly by leveraging the technologies applied in the Human Genome Project. Genome sequences for chickens, cattle, swine, sheep, fish, and horses are now available and provide a basis for understanding the genetic variation related to economically important traits. Similar to results in the Human Genome Project, sequencing of animal genomes has uncovered a large number of genetic polymorphisms that can be used as markers for evaluating the genetic basis of phenotypes. The genomes that have been sequenced can be used as a reference for a particular family of animals. Using gene mapping, scientists have begun to locate regions of DNA in an animal genome that influence production traits. They use molecular biology and quantitative genetics to find differences in the DNA sequences in these regions. To discover individual animals with superior traits, breeders apply Marker- Assisted Selection (MAS) technology in which Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) analyses are used to locate markers in the genome. Markers are not normally the actual gene sequence, but rather a sequence that is near the gene of interest in the chromosome. Laboratory tests can then genotype individuals to determine which DNA-marker alleles they carry. Some simple traits such as coat color and presence or absence of horns are controlled by one gene whereas economically important traits (e.g. birth weight, reproduction, meat quality, or milk production) are complex traits controlled by protein products of multiple genes and affected by the environment of the animal. This process is an emerging technology that will likely become increasingly more precise through . MAS has the potential of more rapidly discovering superior livestock genetics and enhancing the productivity of livestock farming. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Genetic Engineering of Livestock MAS has the potential of vastly increasing the efficiency of selective breeding livestock, but it cannot introduce traits that are not part of a particular animal species as can genetic engineering of animals. The technology has been available for almost years, and it has evolved from a very inefficient level at which only to percent of the offspring were transgenic because the pronuclear microinjection into an animal egg immediately after fertilization produced random integration of the transgene in the genome. The introduction of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology greatly advanced the transgenic modification of animals. This technology consists of inserting a transgene in the nucleus of the cell of the animal and then transferring that nucleus into the denucleated egg of the animal, and then transplanting that egg into the womb of a surrogate animal. This technology can also be used to clone livestock as was done with the sheep, Dolly. It is now the most efficient option for producing transgenic or cloned animals. In recent years, other efficient methods of delivering transgenes have been developed. Transposon-mediated transgenesis technology consists of microinjecting a transposon-containing plasmid DNA into fertilized eggs, which are then transferred to a surrogate female. This technology has produced transgenic animals with an average frequency of percent. Viral-mediated technologies are also being developed for transferring the transgene. Currently a number of livestock species with a variety of transgenes have been successfully produced using these methods. Other areas still require technology improvement, such as when a non-targeted gene insertion can disrupt important genes in the host animal; this decreases the efficiency of producing animals that express the transgene. Until the present, the only application of transgenics in animals that has been commercialized is a drug, a recombinant antithrombin, produced in transgenic goats milk. Transgenic animals for food production have not achieved regulatory approval anywhere in the world, and the technology has met with public resistance for food applications. Some potential applications, however, could benefit livestock agriculture by increasing the efficiency of production, improving animal health, and altering the nutritional value of animal products. A genetically engineered Atlantic salmon with a growth hormone transgene is undergoing the FDA approval process. These transgenic salmon reach market weight faster and use feed more efficiently than wild salmon. Another potential application is genetically engineering a pig to synthesize lysine, an essential amino acid. A metabolic pathway for synthesizing lysine is not part of any pig breed; as a consequence, pig feed must be supplemented with lysine. By introducing a transgene for lysine synthesis from a bacterium or yeast into a pig genome, the process of separately adding lysine to pig feed could be eliminated. Transgenics can also be used to protect animal health. Using a transgene from a nonpathogenic species of Staphylococcus that produces lysostaphin, scientists genetically engineered cows that produced lysostaphin in their milk to resist the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus that causes mastitis. Despite the potential for genetic engineering technology to produce major breakthroughs in livestock production, the technical and regulatory hurdles that transgenic and cloning face make them unlikely to have a major impact on agriculture by .

Annex C Emerging Water Management Technologies Because agriculture uses approximately percent of the global freshwater supply and percent of agriculture uses irrigation, technology that reduces irrigation requirements is critical to the long-term availability of water. Global population increase will put more demand on arable land and water resources. Irrigation as generally practiced is very inefficient. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reported that agricultural irrigation wastes on average percent of the water withdrawn from freshwater sources. Losses occur through evaporation, deep infiltration, or weed growth. Increasing the efficiency of irrigation for the global food production dependent on irrigation would have a major impact on water availability. Although rainfed agriculture, which represents percent of global agriculture production, does not rely on rivers and lakes for its water, technologies do exist that can contribute to increasing the yield of rainfed agriculture and reduce the need for withdrawal from surface water sources. Worldwide percent of all cereal area is rainfed, including percent of rice, percent of wheat, percent of corn and percent of coarse grains. Adopting water management technologies in rainfed agricultural regions can contribute to overall agricultural productivity. Desalination of seawater and brackish water is widely practiced and has in some cases achieved water cost of production close to that of freshwater acquisition. Even though desalination might be economically feasible for household and industrial water, it is not feasible for large-scale agriculture. Adopting technologies that increase water-use efficiency is the only option farmers have for confronting global water scarcity. Advanced Irrigation Technology Subsurface-Drip-Irrigation Systems. Recognizing the low-water efficiency of irrigation, farmers have begun using drip irrigation, which reduces water losses substantially. Drip-irrigation systems consist of plastic tubing with regularly spaced emitters or pores that distribute a controlled flow of water directly onto the ground. To avoid evaporation and apply water at the active root zone of plants, subsurface, drip- irrigation (SDI) systems are becoming the norm. Since the s, Israel has led the application of drip irrigation in the world as the most efficient way of delivering water to plants and has made innovations applicable to large- scale agriculture. In desert climates evaporation causes as much as percent loss of water in conventional surface or spray irrigation. Drip irrigation can reduce evaporative losses by to percent. Generally water-application efficiency (percentage of water delivered to a field that is stored in the crop-root zone) for SDI is - percent compared to furrow irrigation of - percent or sprinkler systems of - percent. Initially farmers used SDI for annual row crops and permanent tree fruits, but design improvements have made the technology suitable for any crop, including those not planted in rows or beds. Advances in drip-irrigation technology are well under way, especially in Israel, and the technology will likely evolve through . The major limitation of SDI is its initial cost, which is about This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. $ -$ /hectare compared to $ -$ /hectare for conventional irrigation. An additional cost advantage of SDI is its efficient application of fertilizer. SDI applies water directly to roots so less nitrate is leached from the soil and less fertilizer is needed. Other advantages of SDI include: Better weed and disease control because the absence of moisture above the soil limits seed germination and disease conditions Less concern about wastewater contaminating the crop with disease-causing microorganisms Long system life, typically years because it is buried underground and out of the heat and sunlight Except for Israel, SDI is not widely applied currently, but its high-water efficiency and likely cost reductions with improved designs will likely make it the norm for irrigation by . Vapor-Transfer Irrigation. To use salt water or other contaminated water for agriculture, vapor-transfer irrigation uses buried tubular pervaporation membranes that allow only vapor to transfer from inside the tube to the external soil. The vapor condenses in the soil where the plants can absorb the water; the salt or other contaminating minerals remain in the tube. This technology is at an early stage with only a few experimental applications completed so far. No cost data or long-term results have been published. As with any desalination technology, the issue of concentrate disposal remains. Although this technique might represent the beginning of a breakthrough in using saltwater for irrigation, we do not know how competitive it will be in with other desalination technologies to produce water for agriculture. Variable-Rate Irrigation. Farmers can use precision agriculture to save water in crop irrigation. Precision agriculture uses advanced technologies such as global positioning satellites (GPS), remote sensors, aerial images, and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess agronomic condition-related to in-field variability. A farmer can use the information gathered by these systems to evaluate precisely sowing density, fertilizer requirements, and other conditions, including the timing and quantity of water for optimum plant growth in various sections of the farmer s field. A GPS receiver provides location data in a field to one meter or less. This information, along with remote sensing of soil conditions, leads to a series of GPS maps of a field. These maps show the moisture and fertilizer levels as well as other soil factors affecting crop growth. This process has given birth to an emerging technology: variable-rate irrigation. Because of the variability in a field resulting from different soil types, topography, or multiple crops different timing and amounts of water are needed in various areas. The rate of water application is controlled by varying the amount of time water flows in the irrigation system in specific locations in the field. In a study done in south Georgia using center pivot irrigation systems, . million gallons of water per year were saved on acres, in comparison with uniform application of water on these fields. The tools to apply variable-rate irrigation are well developed and by their cost will likely come down sufficiently to lead to widespread application.

Yield Advantages with Selected Cultivars and Improved Water Management in Kamataka, India Source: CAB International Rainfed Agriculture. (NOTE: source does not explain blank cells) Water Management Technologies in Rainfed Agriculture. Managing water in a rainfed farm operation can substantially increase crop yield as shown in the table. The yield improvement with improved water management alone, even using a local cultivar, is evident. When integrated with a high-yielding variety, the yield improvement is remarkably improved. Of the rain falling on a crop in a semi-arid zone, - percent is used by the plant in transpiration, - percent is non-productively evaporated from the soil, - percent percolates through the soil, and - percent is surface run-off. Water management in rainfed agriculture involves two basic technologies: harvesting and evaporation control. Water is harvested by collecting and storing runoff and drainage for irrigation in dry spells. Secondly minimizing evaporation from the soil and maximizing transpiration by the crop accomplishes a vapor shift. Water has been stored in tanks and ponds for centuries, but an emerging technology stores water in an underground aquifer through a recharge basin or through a recharge- extraction well. Soil management to reduce evaporation using mulching, zero tillage, intercropping, and windbreaks also results in vapor shift. Greenhouse Agriculture Hydroponic Greenhouse Agriculture. By growing crops on a large scale in hydroponic greenhouses, water usage can be reduced by percent by precisely monitoring plants water needs. Besides saving water, this technology has other advantages: reducing dependency on weather conditions, maintaining consistent crop quality, and avoiding pest control chemicals. Furthermore, greenhouse enclosures that use films to block infrared and ultraviolet light reduce water evaporation and require less cooling. The economics of crop production with greenhouse agriculture currently are not established, but even though greenhouses are currently being used in many parts of the world, their future growth depends on the cost of the greenhouses and the level of automation that can be applied. Vertical Farms. The use of vertical farms for crop production, a step further than hydroponic greenhouse agriculture, would radically alter current agricultural practice for food production. The technology might be Yield Improvement (percent) Crop Local Cultivar with Improved Management High-Yielding Variety with Usual Management High-Yielding Variety with Improved Management Finger Millet - - Groundnut - - Soybean Sunflower - - Maize Sorghum This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. able to produce yields times those of conventional agriculture with percent less water. Envisioned as a means of keeping food production close to urban centers, it would have the advantages of greenhouse agriculture but also eliminate the need for additional farmland, reduce the extent of transportation of food products, and readily recycle the wastewater produced in urban centers. Vertical farming faces some foreboding challenges. It will probably not be energy efficient unless its design includes renewable energy (e.g. wind or solar power), especially since it is not able to rely entirely on sunlight. At this stage, vertical farming is a concept that envisions a radical change in agricultural production that has not been tested, giving its future adoption a high degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, a cost analysis comparing it to conventional farming has yet not been prepared. Water Saving with Plant Genetic Engineering Drought-Tolerant Crops. Another approach to save water in agriculture is to design plants that can survive and grow with less water. When a plant takes CO from the atmosphere, it loses to grams of water for each gram of harvested product. A drought-tolerant plant adapts to dry or drought conditions. Even though scientists have for years been breeding drought-tolerant plants, the genetic traits that contribute to drought tolerance are usually associated with low growth rates and poor yields. Scientists are now using the tools of genetic engineering to breed plants that can survive and grow with less water without a loss of yield. Researchers have discovered genes or molecules that they can alter to produce plants that are drought tolerant. Three approaches exist to engineer drought-tolerant plants: expression of functional proteins, manipulation of transcription factors, and regulation of signaling pathways. Functional proteins (glycine betaine and proline) are osmolytes that increase a plant s water uptake and retention. Transcription factors control the expression of genes involved in drought tolerance. Regulation of signaling pathways involves messenger molecules such as nitric oxide, which prevents loss of cell function and death when low-water conditions stress a plant. Scientists have developed drought tolerance in several large-acreage crops. Monsanto, Pioneer Hi-Bred, and Syngenta are testing genetically modified corn varieties that can tolerate periodic drought conditions without loss of yield stability. Arcadia Biosciences and the University of California, Davis have developed and are field-testing genetically engineered rice that displays drought tolerance. Monsanto and BASF have jointly developed genetically engineered maize that has been subjected to field trials in South Africa and the western United States. Without additional irrigation, the drought-tolerant maize produced yields that were percent higher than conventionally grown maize. Research on developing drought tolerance in crops has been ongoing for many decades. The task is foreboding because over genes are reportedly active in drought tolerance. Performance Plants in Kingston, Ontario is commercializing drought-tolerant corn, soybean, cotton, ornamentals, and turf grass with yields reported to be to percent higher than non- transgenic control crops. Pioneer Hi-Bred began selling drought-tolerant corn in . Salt-Tolerant Crops. Developing salt-tolerant crops might be a way to reduce the freshwater requirements of agriculture. Wild plants (halophytes) exist that tolerate salt and grow in saline environments. Genetic engineering to make salt-tolerant crops uses three general approaches: sodium exclusion from the plant cells, compartmentation of the sodium, and excretion of sodium. Scientists at the University of California, Davis have engineered tomato and canola plants. These transgenic plants were able to tolerate water with a salt concentration equivalent to percent of the salt in seawater, a level that normally inhibits the growth of all crop plants. The edible portion of these plants showed only marginal increases in sodium. Scientists at the University of Adelaide in collaboration with scientists at the University of Cambridge are developing salt-tolerant wheat, rice, and barley. They modified genes This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. involved with the conduction of water in the plant so that salt is removed before transpiration and does not enter the plant shoot. Scientists at Arcadia Biosciences in Davis, California are developing technology that allows plants to have normal yields and quality in saline conditions. They expect the technology to be widely applicable to various crops, including corn, rice, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa, vegetable, and turf. Although this salt-tolerant crop technology would reduce the need for freshwater in some agricultural regions, it currently has been only tested in field trials. It has not been tested in long-term trials to see whether the technology has adverse effects. Furthermore, regulatory approval has not yet been sought for genetically engineered salt-tolerant crops. The technology faces many hurdles before it can be commercialized, which is unlikely by . This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views.

Annex D Emerging Technologies in Soil Management Soil productivity depends on how well the soil provides the physical, chemical, moisture, and biological conditions to sustain plant growth. In searching for increased agricultural productivity, scientists are examining technologies that restore and maintain the physical structure of soils, improve the efficiency of water and nutrient use, and enhance the rhizosphere where microbes interact with plant roots. The content and structure of soils varies considerably in different regions, as does the climate, so that localized soil management technologies are necessary. Current agricultural practices include a number of technologies for maintaining soil productivity and improving soil nutrition: mulching, application of manure, crop rotation, contouring, conservation tillage and nontilling, irrigation control, soil nutrient management, biological nitrogen fixation, and controlled use of fertilizers. Soil organic carbon (SOC) correlates strongly with soil productivity, for example, in India when soil management practices increased SOC, yields increased by a factor of . . Nitrogen Fixation Technology in Non-Legumes Transgenics. Because nitrogen in soils is the limiting factor on plant growth, chemical fertilizers are used for most crops. Bacteria can convert atmospheric nitrogen to a form that can be used by a plant for nitrogen fixation. In legumes, a symbiotic relationship exists between nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi that interact with the roots of a plant to supply nitrogen to the plant. Scientists have for many years worked on ways of transferring the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of legumes to other crops like cereal grains, but have had little success. In , scientists at Recherche pour le Developpement and the University of Munich discovered the genetic element in leguminous plants that gives them nitrogen-fixing capability. This might be a first step in developing a transgenetic technology for installing a nitrogen-fixing capability in cereal crops like rice, corn, and wheat. However, it is only a first step because at least genes would have to be inserted into a non-legume to transform it with the capacity of fixing nitrogen. Facilitated Evolution. The development of nitrogen fixation in non-legumes by facilitated evolution is another research approach for developing nitrogen-fixing for non-legumes. The method entails a stepwise genetic improvement of both the nitrogen-fixating microbes and the host plant with the aim of eventually finding an effective nitrogen-fixation association. The research requires identification of dozens of genes related to the complex interaction between the bacteria and the host plant. Scientists have worked with the main cereal crops and the bacteria Rhizobia, Frankia, and cyanobacteria by inserting the bacteria into the roots of a plant or the entire plant. So far, they have gained some initial insights in genetically controlling the ability of nitrogen-fixing bacteria to colonize in plants. If either transgenics or facilitated evolution were successful in transferring nitrogen-fixing capability to the major grain crops, this breakthrough would be extraordinary in agricultural technology. However, technical hurdles that the transgenic technology faces are especially difficult to overcome: one, the linkage of desired nitrogen-fixing genes to genes providing disease and pest resistance might interfere with a plant s resistance to pests and diseases; two, the insertion of bacterial plasmid sequences along with the desired nitrogen-fixing genes might harm the plant; and three, genes might flow from the This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. transformed plant to non-transgenic plants or wild plants. Because of the difficult technical challenges and the limited ongoing research effort, nitrogen-fixation might not be accomplished in cereal crops by . Soil Microorganism Modification Technology Phytostimulation. The rhizosphere consists of root tissue, root surfaces, and the soil influenced by the root. Microbes exist in this environment on plant roots and soil surfaces in thin water biofilms. The rhizosphere is different from the bulk soil biologically and chemically, and the effects of plant pathology and growth promoting microorganisms affect the yield and quality of crops. Research on the rihizosphere has indicated that modifying soil microorganisms might reduce the need for fertilizer and pesticides and stimulate growth. Phytostimulation refers to the technology of stimulating the effect of the rhizosphere on plant health and growth. Farmers use soil inoculants to enhance crop growth and yield, but the relationship between plants and rhizosphere microorganisms is not well understood. Application of molecular biology to the microorganisms of the rhizosphere might lead to increases in crop yield. For example, scientists have shown that the phytohormones of cyanobacteria can improve the growth and yield of wheat plants. Disease-Suppressive Soils. Scientists have discovered that some groups of soil microorganisms can protect plants and suppress plant pathogens. Because many of these organisms cannot be cultured in a laboratory, metagenomic analysis has been used to study them in their natural environment, identify them, and use them in soil inoculants. Further developments in this area might lead to better control of plant diseases and reduce the need for pesticides. Phosphorous Uptake. Another key input to plant growth is phosphorous, which must be externally supplied to the plant. Phosphorous uptake in plants is very inefficient because much of it is locked up in the soil and is unavailable to the plant. The plant recovers only to percent of the applied phosphorous. In addition the world supply of phosphorous used in fertilizers is limited with forecasts projecting its total depletion before the end of the century. Bacteria and fungi can also enhance phosphorous uptake, but so far progress has been limited in developing this technology. Research on the relationship between crops and phosphorous uptake organisms might eventually lead to major improvement in phosphorus fertilizer efficiency. However, in view of the limited progress so far, this development is unlikely by . Nano-Particles. Zeolites are used as soil amendments to improve the efficiency of fertilizer, improve water infiltration and retention, and retain nutrients for plants. Research on zeolites has focused on changing its molecular structure to improve its effectiveness. Some researchers are investigating nanotechnology as a way to improve the performance of zeolites. The atom-by-atom arrangement in nanotechnology enables the ability to control the size, shape, and orientation for reaction with soil or plant tissue. The soil applications of nanotechnology that have been proposed include nanoporous zeolites for slow release of fertilizer and water, nanocapsules for controlled release of herbicide and pesticide delivery, and nanosensors for pest detection. Concern about the health effects of nano-particles is growing, and some organizations have advocated not using them in soils until their safety has been established.

Annex E Emerging Technologies in Aquaculture Fish food supplies have grown significantly since , fueled by the rapid increase in aquaculture the growing of aquatic animals and plants for food. It is increasing at an annual rate of . percent since , compared to the annual rate of increase for the world s population of . percent. As an excellent source of affordable, high-quality animal protein, fish accounted for approximately percent of the global population s intake of animal protein in and approximately percent of all protein consumed. With capture-fish production stagnating, the increase in demand for fish products will have to be met by aquaculture. As the fastest growing animal-food-producing sector, aquaculture s contribution to total food fish consumption has increased from less than percent in to percent in , and will soon account for more than half of the world s supply of food fish. The Asia-Pacific region dominates aquaculture, which accounts for percent of production in terms of quantity. Per capita supply of food fish from aquaculture increased from . kg in to . kg in , an average annual growth rate of . percent. In a World Bank report, all forecast scenarios where stagnating capture-fish production was a key assumption showed the demand for aquaculture would continue to grow to , with growth rates ranging from . percent to . percent per year. Major increases in aquaculture productivity through the entire production and distribution cycle have driven the growth in aquaculture. Key developments have included advances in fish seeds (genetically improved fish), fish nutrition, and disease control; the developments of new forms of aquaculture; the integration with farming and waste disposal systems; and the development of a global supply, distribution, and retain chain. In Asia, many large processors have established large centralized processing plants to improve yields and respond better to evolving quality and safety requirements. Improved processing technologies also contribute to better utilization of fish waste for a wide variety of uses, including water treatment, cosmetics, agrochemicals, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals. As a result of the productivity improvements and significant output increases, prices of many aquaculture products, including large quantity products like carp and tilapia, have fallen steadily over the last years. Through to , four technologies will fuel the growth in supply of aquaculture and very likely falling prices: Genetically Improved Fish. Genetic improvement of cultured species will likely continue to improve aquaculture productivity and reduce the impact on the environment. Culture biology advancements and genetic improvements focus on the domestication of new species, development of new rearing methods in hatcheries, and development of new breeding stocks to increase the yield and help reduce disease and requirements for feed, space, and water. In , Gjedrem of the Institute of Aquaculture Research in Norway estimated that only percent of aquaculture production was based on genetically improved fish and shellfish, but expects this percentage to increase by . Nutrition, Feeds, and Feeding Practices. Feed is typically the largest cost item in commercial aquaculture systems in which animals are fed, accounting for approximately percent of total costs. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Research is continuing on the development of alternative ingredients to fish meal and fish oil, such as chicken-processing waste or plant products like soybean and canola; the development of optimized high- efficiency, low-polluting diet formulations; and more precise, automated feed delivery systems. Salmon farmers, for example, have reduced the food-conversion ratio (ratio of the total weight of feed eaten by a crop of fish from the time they are purchased as juveniles to the time they are harvested to the weight of the fish at harvest) from : in the s to . : in the first decade of the st Century, resulting in substantial savings in cost and reduction in wastes discharged. Gains in the future will likely reduce this ratio to below : . Closed Recirculating Systems. Aquaculture is leveraging advances in biological processes and the complex interactions among nutrients, bacteria, and cultured organisms to engineer closed aquaculture systems that will even allow farming of marine organisms at locations far from the sea. In recirculating systems, some or all of the water in a fish culture facility is reused to control better the rearing environment, minimize water usage, effectively remove waste products from the system, and provide for more efficient heating and cooling of the water. A key advantage of these closed systems is the isolation of the aquaculture systems from the natural ecosystems, minimizing the risk of disease or genetic impacts on the environment. Recirculating systems have been producing eels in Denmark for many years, helping Denmark to be a leading eel producer in Europe. Coinciding with the development of large-scale recirculating technology will be the development of alternative fish feeds that use plant-based proteins to replace fish meal and fish oil. Open Ocean Systems. With oceans occupying most of the earth s surface, the use of open ocean systems could dramatically change the nature of human food production. Today most ocean aquaculture takes place in protected coastal areas. However, inshore experiences and technology from marine engineering and the offshore oil and gas industry will likely combine to facilitate the use of large cages or containment structures in open seas for rearing and harvesting fish. The key barriers will be the costs of the large offshore installations and the challenge of minimizing the potential for environmental impacts from those facilities when in operation. To withstand the harsh conditions offshore, mechanization of key tasks will be required to minimize human involvement, continuous monitoring of key environmental conditions and fish behavior and health will be needed to ensure productive and efficient operations, and surface containment structures that can survive rough seas or below-the-surface facilities will be required. The engineering knowledge exists to design large-scale open-ocean farms. Since , several early commercial designs have been deployed around the world, including in the United States. A UK water analysis in concluded a large open ocean farm in UK waters would be economically viable for fast- growing species of marine finfish. A NOAA Technical Memorandum in also highlighted the current commercial potential of open-ocean systems. This paper does not represent US Government views.

Annex F Emerging Precision Agriculture Technologies Precision agriculture encompasses a range of related technologies and practices that help farmers understand and manage land variations that can affect crop growth. Existing precision agriculture techniques tend to focus on discovering how factors like soil quality, water availability, drainage patterns, and the like vary within a single field, and then adapting planting, harvesting, and management strategies to address those variations. Information about within-field variations can come from a range of sources, including sampling and testing; handheld, equipment-mounted, or field-distributed sensors; or ground- based, aerial, or satellite-based surveys. Management strategies can vary widely in sophistication, aim to increase crop yields, or reduce the consumption of costly inputs like seed, fertilizer, and herbicides. Precision agriculture s focus on understanding and adapting to within-field variations likely results from various factors that helped fuel precision agriculture s development. Although crop scientists have long been experimenting with methods to leverage information from aerial and satellite photographs and field surveys to inform crop-management practices, precision agriculture techniques did not begin to see widespread adoption until the s, when changes in the US agribusiness landscape began to increasingly favor very large farms and high levels of vertical integration. As farm fields grew, conventional field-management methods that treated each field as a monolithic entity gave way to alternative management techniques that emphasized understanding of intra-field variations and their impacts on crop yield. At the same time, satellite-navigation systems were falling rapidly in price, and the various information-technology resources necessary to generate, update, and leverage customized field maps were becoming accessible to and affordable by commercial farmers. Because of its development history, precision agriculture is bound up heavily with the large-scale industrial-agriculture practices that predominate in regions like the midwestern United States, southern Brazil, and parts of Canada, Germany, and Australia. Relatively low capital costs, high land availability, and an emphasis on efficiency (including labor-efficiency) help motivate farmers in these regions to purchase larger and more sophisticated farm vehicles that integrate precision agriculture technologies. Although some precision agriculture techniques can be employed on small-scale farms that rely on human labor instead of mechanical labor, the most advanced precision agriculture technologies rely on a very high level of automation not just in terms of application but also in terms of decisionmaking. The capital recovery costs for US corn (maize), soybeans, and wheat shown in Annex J account for to percent of the production cost. Precision agriculture would likely add considerably to these existing costs, and it may be that by the yield increases with this added technology cannot compensate for the added costs. For precision agriculture technologies to diffuse on a wide scale in the future and in a manner that will have a substantial impact on global food production and resource consumption, the kinds of automated guidance and application systems that are emerging on large farm vehicles will have to decrease in size and cost to also work well in small-scale plots in the developing world, where the greatest potential productivity gains can be made. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. The following overview of precision agriculture technologies illustrates a potential pathway of progression that could see mechanized agriculture undergo a dramatic transformation that would make it suitable for application almost anywhere. Basic Elements: Mapping and Managing In many respects, satellite-navigation receivers are a foundational technology for precision agriculture and have the most widespread adoption of all precision agriculture technologies. Such receivers typically use signals from the US Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation, together with correction signals from a fixed ground-based transmitter to provide the kind of extremely accurate location information that is important for precision agriculture applications. One of the most common uses of GPS receivers in precision agriculture is generating geo-referenced soil maps. Farmers use handheld GPS receivers to mark the precise within-field locations of soil samples, and then correlate soil samples and GPS coordinates in a geographic information systems (GIS) database. Various technologies and techniques are available for measuring soil properties, including laboratory testing of samples, probes that can measure soil s electrical conductivity (to determine water content), and handheld pH meters (many of which integrate or connect to GPS receivers to produce geo-referenced data without requiring the farmer to input such data separately). Many sensors can also mount on vehicles to facilitate faster testing in large fields. Remote sensors can also take continuous measurements of soil quality indicators and transmit those measurements for incorporation in a central database. GPS and GIS are also used to measure and map indicators of crop health and vigor, and as with soil sampling, a wide range of sensors and methods can be used to conduct such geo-referenced measurements. For example, handheld and vehicle-mounted sensors are available that can measure the chlorophyll content in crop leaves by measuring the light energy reflected off the leaves. Low chlorophyll content can indicate nutrient deficiency, plant diseases, or other problems. Similar sensors are available for measuring other health indicators including crop temperature (which can indicate water deficiencies), sugar content (to help determine the ripeness of fruit), and insect infestation. Farmers can use geo-referenced monitoring data to support site-specific field management practices that vary the application of crop inputs (seed, fertilizer, and pesticide) based on factors like crop vigor and soil fertility. A common technique for site-specific input management is to break down a field into management zones and then calculate the optimal distribution of inputs within each zone. The zone method is popular because it is relatively easy to use with imprecise application systems that disperse uniform amounts of inputs in a broadcast pattern. Calculating required inputs is typically the job of specialized software that often requires expensive licenses. However, inputs can be calculated manually using formulas, assuming the farmer possesses the requisite knowledge. A major ongoing issue with precision agriculture is determining what levels of inputs are appropriate for various field conditions. Current recommended formulas generally are based on many decades worth of crop science research. However, they are typically used for conventional whole-field management on a region-by-region basis, and are not necessarily well suited for the much smaller scale management techniques in use in precision agriculture. Researchers are developing new suites of algorithms that are tailored for precision agriculture applications and can be customized to conditions within individual fields regardless of region. Unlike many precision agriculture technologies, geospatial-referenced input mapping might be relatively straightforward to adapt to work with the kind of small-scale farming operations that are common within the developing world. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Because of their centrality to both mechanized and possible future nonmechanized precision agriculture, mapping and recommendation technologies are likely to become the most critical precision agriculture components. The First Integrated Systems: Yield Monitors Yield monitors, the first integrated precision agriculture solutions to emerge, became available on combine harvesters in the s and are currently the most popular type of integrated precision agriculture system. A typical yield monitor uses an impact sensor to measure the flow of processed grain as it enters a harvester s grain tank. A separate sensor measures the grain s moisture level to help correct for moisture-induced variations in grain mass, thereby improving the reliability of the grain-flow measurement. Yield monitors enable farmers to track yields with considerably more accuracy than is possible using legacy methods (such as weighing grain at the time of sale to a downstream processor). Such accurate yield data help farmers manage the business aspects of running a farm, such as negotiating crop leases. Farmers also have used moisture sensor components in yield monitors to gather information about crop conditions that can inform subsequent planting strategies and crop-handling practices. Yield monitors become a far more powerful tool when combined with satellite-navigation information and mapping software. Combine harvesters equipped with both yield monitors and GPS systems can correlate instantaneous yield measurements with precise locations within a field. Specialized software can then use those correlated data to generate yield maps, which can show farmers which areas of the field generate exceptionally high or low-yield levels. Yield maps can help farmers troubleshoot a wide range of issues with their fields that they would otherwise have had great difficulty in uncovering using other techniques like geo-referenced soil mapping. For example, a low-yield area of a field that also produces grain with unusually high moisture content might have drainage problems. Yield monitoring can also help farmers track the results of experimentation with different planting strategies and management techniques to determine what works best for specific areas of their fields. Emerging Technologies: Variable-Rate Application and Automated Guidance One of the most significant developments in integrated precision agriculture systems to occur in the past decade was the introduction of variable-rate application systems for fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, and herbicides. Such systems replace conventional fixed-rate application systems on farm implements or purpose-specific vehicles. Variable-rate systems can allow a farmer to deliver a targeted dose of crop inputs precisely where they are needed. The most basic variable-rate application systems are controller- operated, meaning that a farmer must manually adjust the system s outputs when the vehicle s navigation system indicates that it is entering a new management zone. Increasingly, variable-rate application systems link directly to a vehicle s onboard GPS/GIS systems and modulate input dispersion rates based on mapping data. The most advanced systems use on-the-go sensing and application technology, in which implement- or tractor-mounted sensor arrays measure crop status indicators dynamically and direct spray nozzles or other variable-rate applicators to deliver appropriate inputs to address problems. For example, an herbicide-spraying implement equipped with on-the-go technology can identify weeds using optical sensors and deliver just enough targeted herbicide to kill each weed using articulated spray heads. On-the-go sensing and application systems can also leverage data from mapping databases to This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. improve accuracy and responsiveness, and the sensors inputs can, in turn, provide valuable information to update those databases to facilitate future decision support. Farmers frequently pair variable-rate application systems with guidance systems that help keep tractors and implements on course within a field, reducing farmer workload while improving the accuracy of variable-rate application. Even without variable-rate application systems, farmers can find guidance systems helpful in navigating fields and determining crossover points between management zones. The most basic guidance systems supplement a navigation map display with a light bar indicator that assists the farmer to keep the vehicle on a predetermined path as precisely as possible. More advanced systems increasingly incorporate active guidance, including automated tractor steering and a separate guidance and steering system for the implement. Basic automated steering systems keep tractors on a very precise straight-line course through a field, but the farmer still needs to turn the tractor around manually to initiate another field pass. The best current systems can both steer and turn a tractor and can achieve extremely high levels of precision, directing massive farm implements that span dozens of crop rows in repeatable patterns with +/- inch tolerance even over rough or sloping fields. Future Technologies: Farm Robots and Smart Fields Future trends in precision agriculture point to increasing automation of farm vehicle and implement control. Several manufacturers have already demonstrated guidance systems that allow tractors to drive themselves, performing limited tasks like following alongside a human-driven combine harvester while pulling a grain-collecting wagon, autonomously driving the wagon to a preset point to drop off the grain, and then returning to the harvester s location to collect more grain. Within the next five to ten years, autonomous tractors will likely begin taking on a full range of roles on large-scale farms. Efficiency gains from widespread use of automated guidance and on-the-go sensing and application technology might help autonomous farming become much more profitable than conventional farming, spurring increased investment in autonomous farming technologies. More importantly, once the benefits of autonomous farming become well established, experts widely expect that efficiency-driven trends toward ever-bigger farm vehicles will reverse themselves. Many experts expect that efficiency concerns will instead favor deployment of large swarms of small, specialized farm robots that will work on small sections of field at a time, perhaps hours a day. Each vehicle will equip sufficient sensors and software (either through onboard control systems or data links to remote systems) to allow it to manage its field section in an optimal way. Together with distributed sensor networks that monitor soil and crop conditions and the software that integrates data gathering and command-and-control, future smart fields could all but farm themselves. Among other things, economies of scale that could result from a proliferation of smart fields in the developed world might help make mechanized precision agriculture more feasible in smallholder- and urban-agriculture contexts, dramatically increasing the amount of land undergoing high-intensity, high-yield cultivation in the future. The path from autonomous tractors to farm robots might not be a smooth one. Experts have noted that autonomous farm vehicles present novel safety and security concerns. Although autonomous farm machines might operate far more safely than human-driven machines, accidents still might occur. Depending on jurisdiction, a court might have a relatively easy time applying current product liability laws to a future case in which an autonomous farm machine injures or kills a person who happened to stray into its path. But such an incident or, especially, a rash of such incidents might have very uncertain This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. consequences public acceptance of the technology. If the public comes rightly or wrongly to regard autonomous farm vehicles as a menace, then lawmakers might act to ban or severely restrict application of the technology. Depending on when and under what circumstances such a ban occurs, and the nature of the ban, development of the kinds of farm robots that could help bring precision agriculture to the masses would stall. A related concern involves malicious actors taking control of autonomous farm vehicles and using them to wreak havoc. An autonomous tractor the size of a large bulldozer, even without its implement (which can be wider than a four-lane highway) could be a potent terrorist s weapon. Smaller farm robots might be less readily weaponizable, but still certainly present concern. A number of potential strategies exist for manufacturers to ensure that farm robots are not misused. Whether such strategies will be effective at deterring attacks is unknown. Another unknown is whether lawmakers will impose so many security- related restrictions on farm robots that deploying such robots in areas where they can have the highest impact might become impossible. Of course, many of the gains possible from precision agriculture do not require farm robot swarms or smart fields; human workers could perform variable-rate application by hand by using handheld sensors and GPS maps. But precision agriculture is much more than sensing and application; it is also extremely challenging knowledge work. Specialized software for data-processing and decision-support can automate much of that knowledge work and help make precision agriculture easier for individuals to practice. However, using such software still generally requires a significant level of knowledge. The same trends that might drive down the size of farm vehicles might also end up helping to move many of the planning and decision making aspects of precision agriculture so that the human farmer is out of the loop. In such a scenario, the self-managing smart fields of the future might be agnostic as to whether humans or robots tend to them. In the case of human-managed fields, software might be able to provide field hands with exact, easy-to-follow instructions on where to go, when and how to apply inputs, which fruit to pick, and so on. In any case, farm labor is extremely difficult and demanding work, and chemicals used on farms can be very harmful to humans. A future of smart farms managed by what are essentially human robots is not necessarily a desirable one, but the high cost of robotic smart field systems might ensure that much of the developed world uses a mix of human- and robot-managed fields.

Annex G Emerging Biofuel Technologies The use of transportation biofuels primarily ethanol and biodiesel has grown rapidly worldwide, but according to some experts, today s biofuels have drawbacks: they provide little environmental benefit, consume food crops, and are expensive. US corn-based ethanol production reached billion gallons in , but consumed percent of the US corn crop and billions of dollars in federal government subsidies while supplying only percent of US gasoline demand. Next-generation technologies that convert biomass (rather than food crops) to advanced biofuels and chemicals promise to be more sustainable and lower cost. These emerging technologies are critical to the long-term security of the world s food supplies and help reduce global dependence on petroleum fuels. This section provides an overview of new technologies and market issues that will influence the success of advanced biofuels over the next several decades. One of the biggest drivers of advanced biofuels is government policies. The United States and the European Union have aggressive biofuel mandates in place that include sustainability standards. The US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires billion gallons of biofuels by with increasing amounts of advanced biofuels that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions below a fossil-fuel baseline. A variety of advanced biofuel technologies is in development that might meet the requirements, but costs are still too high and the technologies are not yet proven at commercial scale. Achieving the RFS goals will require years of consistent government support, including Research and Development funding, tax credits, and loan guarantees that support the construction of commercial-scale plants. The viability of advanced biofuels will also depend on relative prices for competing transportation fuels. Biofuels face significant competition from petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuels, which are widely available to consumers through a highly developed distribution and retail system in most countries. High crude oil prices improve the cost competitiveness of renewable biofuels. Very high-efficiency vehicles, including hybrid and pure electric vehicles and hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles, help reduce fossil- fuel use and carbon emissions and thus will also compete with advanced biofuels. Cellulosic Ethanol Cellulosic ethanol is the nearest-term advanced biofuel. This second-generation biofuel is derived from various types of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks including agricultural and forest residues (such as corn stover, rice straw, wheat straw, and bagasse), nonfood energy crops (grasses and trees such as switchgrass, poplar, and miscanthus), and municipal solid waste. Lignocellulosic biomass consists of complex cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin polymers, which are much tougher to break down than corn kernels. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Current Status. The basic biomass conversion technologies biochemical and thermochemical designs have been around for decades, and researchers have made significant progress in reducing costs over the past ten years. Biochemical (sugar-based) pathways use acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose to create sugars, such as glucose and xylose, which subsequently ferment to cellulosic ethanol. Thermochemical pathways use gasification to convert feedstocks to syngas, which subsequently ferment or catalytically convert syngas to cellulosic ethanol and other valuable products. A variety of cellulosic ethanol demonstration plants has operated worldwide since , but developers still do not know which approaches and feedstocks will be most successful at a commercial scale. A major R&D focus is improving the efficiency of the multistep processes. For the biochemical pathways, researchers are working to improve the pretreatment process for breaking down hemicellulose into fermentable sugars. Cellulase enzyme complexes that break down plant cell walls are available commercially but still cost about ten times more than enzymes for corn-based ethanol. Researchers are also engineering specialized yeasts that can ferment the difficult-to-metabolize C and C sugars from cellulosic feedstocks to ethanol. In addition, researchers have identified microbes that that can break down cellulose and ferment sugar in one step eliminating the costly pretreatment step. Future breakthroughs as a result of these efforts are likely to result from alterations by molecular biologists to the genetic code of microorganisms in order to improve enzymatic activity and other functions. Plant breeding and biotechnology can also offer major benefits such as improving biomass yield, reducing feedstock quality variations, and increasing the performance of biomass feedstocks in downstream conversion processes. Researchers at Massachusetts-based firm Agrivida and Swiss-based Syngenta International AG have already incorporated cell wall degrading enzymes directly into the genome of plants. The enzymes activate only under biofuel-processing conditions and initiate hydrolysis of the plant polysaccharides from within the modified biomass, greatly reducing the need for costly pretreatment enzymes. California-based Ceres is developing seeds and traits for high-biomass energy crops and has identified hundreds of candidate genes for traits such as biomass yields, plant architecture, tolerance to environmental stress, more efficient use of soil nitrogen, and disease resistance. Researchers at DOE s BioEnergy Science Center discovered the gene that controls ethanol production capacity in a microorganism, which will allow scientists to genetically alter biomass plants to produce more ethanol. DOE s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy is funding breakthrough plant technologies through its Plants-Engineered-to-Replace-Oil (PETRO) program. PETRO researchers are developing enhanced crops that scan deliver more energy per acre by improving plant photosynthetic processes and producing high-energy fuel molecules within plant leaves and stems, in addition to seeds. Outlook. Cellulosic ethanol companies say they are ready to build at least a dozen commercial-scale facilities over the next few years that could supply several hundred million gallons of cellulosic ethanol. Obtaining financing for risky new plants has been a major barrier. The USDA and DOE have awarded loan guarantees to several cellulosic-ethanol projects. Recent recipients include INEOS Bio, part of Swiss-based chemical firm INEOS, and Illinois-based Coskata, Inc., which plan to start up hybrid plants that combine feedstock-flexible gasification processes with biological fermentation in . Midwestern ethanol producers Abengoa Bioenergy and Poet have announced plans to start up biochemical-based cellulosic-ethanol plants in . Government and other studies suggest that initial production costs will be significantly higher than costs to make ethanol from corn even with corn prices at historic highs. Nonetheless, one or more early developers might be able to produce cellulosic ethanol successfully. The coming wave of commercial plants will provide valuable insights and might lay the groundwork for a viable cellulosic-biofuel industry to begin to develop. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Successful cellulosic-biofuel developers will also need to build up new regional supply chains in which all of the necessary pieces fit together efficiently collecting biomass from fields or forests; creating, storing, and delivering high quality biomass feedstocks to biorefineries; and converting biomass to bioenergy products. A recent study by the DOE s Oak Ridge National Laboratory indicates that the United States has more than enough lignocellulosic biomass from forest and agricultural sources one billion tons of dry biomass annually to displace percent of US petroleum consumption by . Meeting the one- billion-ton benchmark requires adequate biomass market pricing ($ per dry ton at the roadside or farmgate according to the study) without any major changes in agricultural practices (only percent annual yield growth in corn and energy crops and current trends toward no-till cultivation). A new USDA initiative is funding R&D projects that address advanced biofuel needs across supply chains from sustainable production of forest and agricultural energy crops to production of high-value biofuels. Projects include planting grasses with legumes to provide nutrients to marginal land while reducing nitrogen runoff into waterways. Many cellulosic-biofuel developers have partnered with large industrial firms to help speed the commercialization of novel technologies. Oil companies have a natural affinity for the biofuels business, including knowledge of how to manage large-scale commercial projects and produce and market transportation fuels on a massive scale. Royal Dutch Shell is a long-term investor in Iogen Corp., which makes cellulosic ethanol from agricultural residues at a large demonstration plant in Canada. Shell also has an interest in California biocatalyst developer Codexis, focusing on the development of more powerful enzymes for faster conversion of biomass to fuels. BP recently acquired all of the assets of Vercipia Biofuels, a cellulosic-ethanol business that BP created with Massachusetts-based Verenium. Chemical giant DuPont owns DuPont Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC, which operates a demonstration plant in Tennessee and is planning to build a commercial facility within the next few years. Biomass-Based Biodiesel Biodiesel has seen rapid growth worldwide, especially in Europe. Most biodiesel currently is derived from food plant oils such as rapeseed, soy, and palm oil, used cooking oils discarded as waste from restaurants, and animal fats. Biodiesel is typically blended with conventional diesel fuel in low concentrations since pure biodiesel has a tendency to solidify or gel at low temperatures. Finland s Neste Oil produces an enhanced product (NExBTL renewable diesel) that can be used in blends in any concentration. Researchers are also developing cellulosic-biodiesel technologies that use biomass feedstocks and do not depend on food crops. Choren Industries GmbH, with collaboration from Shell and other partners, has developed a biomass-to-liquids process involving high-temperature gasification of biomass followed by a catalytic process to make a clean, high quality, synthetic biodiesel. Choren s Carbo-V process converts more than percent of woody biomass material, whereas conventional biodiesel processing converts less than percent of the mass of dried plants. In , Choren commissioned a large biomass-to-liquids pilot plant at Freiberg, Germany, and is studying the feasibility of larger-scale facilities. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Biobutanol Biobutanol is a new biofuel that is not yet commercially available. Biobutanol gained wide prominence in when BP and DuPont announced plans to produce it commercially using a fermentation process. Most butanol (for chemical uses) today comes from petrochemical feedstocks. Butanol has several advantages over ethanol, including higher energy density and immiscibility with water, allowing it to blend more easily with gasoline and other fuels. Biobutanol production processes are still at the lab scale or early pilot stage of development. However, published data on butanol-producing organisms indicate low yields relative to ethanol production via fermentation. BP-DuPont Biofuels and several other companies are working to develop and commercialize new biobutanol technologies using proprietary biocatalysts and microbes. Initially, developers will use the same agricultural food crops as ethanol such as corn, wheat, sugar beet, cassava, and sugarcane. The use of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks is planned for later and requires further technology development. Colorado-based Gevo, Inc. recently received a USDA research grant to enhance its cellulosic yeast strain and fermentation process to produce biobutanol jet fuel from woody biomass. Drop-in Biofuels Since the mid- s, many advanced biofuel developers and investors have shifted their focus to third- generation drop-in biofuels that have higher energy potential than ethanol or biobutanol and can blend with conventional petroleum fuels at high percentages without changes to existing transportation-fuel infrastructures. By contrast, ethanol cannot be mixed with gasoline at refineries or transported by pipelines. Instead, ethanol is typically transported by rail or truck and blended into gasoline at terminals near the end users, which adds costs and can strain distribution systems. Drop-in technologies include renewable hydrocarbons produced by algae and advanced processes that convert plant sugars to hydrocarbons. These technologies are less mature and costs are still high. Many developers are initially targeting higher-value fuel, chemical, and specialty markets rather than commodity fuel markets. Algae-Based Biofuels. Algae are potentially rich sources of biofuels and have become a subject of intense research and investor interest. Algae-based technologies offer major benefits including very high production rates; the ability to use otherwise nonproductive, nonarable land and a wide variety of water sources fresh, saline, and wastewater; and the potential to recycle carbon dioxide and other wastes. More than percent of algae mass might consist of bio-oils that can be used as drop-in replacements for diesel, gasoline, aviation fuels, and specialty products. The DOE was a major force in early algal- biofuels development from to . That work ended because crude oil prices were far too low for algae-based fuels to compete, but the National Renewable Energy Laboratory s Aquatic Species Program demonstrated impressive productivity, with photosynthetic algae yields in excess of dry tons per acre in an open-pond system. The DOE s latest algal-biofuels-development roadmap published in indicates that a dedicated R&D program can bring algal-fuel economics to a competitive level within ten years, although that time frame might be optimistic. Major technical challenges remain from basic algal biology to cultivation to production and scale up of integrated processes. Synthetic-biology techniques are helping to bring down the costs of algae-based biofuels by changing the way microalgae use light and improving their efficiency in producing fuels. However, growing and harvesting algae is still somewhat of an art. Technology approaches include the cultivation of photosynthetic algae in large open ponds, growing genetically This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. engineered algae in enclosed photobioreactors, and growing genetically engineered algae that consume sugar inside dark fermentation tanks. Each approach has drawbacks. In open ponds, for example, wild algae strains from the environment can crowd out highly productive strains, and high-growth algae in sealed bioreactors can overheat. Algae production is energy intensive technologies typically produce biofuels indirectly by growing algal biomass; then harvesting, dewatering, and extracting oil; and then processing the oil into a biodiesel or other fuel product. Researchers also need to better understand and manage high water-related costs. Algae can grow in wastewater, but potential pathogens can kill the algae and water-treatment technologies are expensive. For the open-pond option, large amounts of freshwater are necessary to replenish evaporated water to avoid concentrating contaminants. Some investors have begun to question whether algae-based biofuels will ever be economically viable. California-based algal-biotechnology developer Solazyme, Inc. has had success in lowering production costs significantly by growing algae in fermentation tanks without sunlight by feeding them sugar a concentrated source of energy that allows the algae to grow rapidly. Solazyme received an order from the US Navy in late to provide , gallons of its algae-based biofuel. Solazyme s recent S- filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that its lead algae strain for fuels and chemicals could make a crude oil for less than $ , per metric ton (about $ per barrel) at a commercial scale using sugarcane feedstock. Renewable Hydrocarbons. Wisconsin-based Virent Energy Systems has developed new technology the BioForming process to make renewable hydrocarbons from bio-based feedstocks. This process converts plant sugars into biogasoline using a chemical-reforming catalyst. Virent claims that the biogasoline s performance is similar to that of petroleum gasoline. The company began operating a demonstration plant in using conventional biofuel feedstocks such as sugar beets. Virent has also shown that it can convert cellulosic biomass including corn stover and pine tree residuals to biogasoline. Virent s technology is one of six different process strategies in the DOE s grant program with the National Advanced Biofuels Consortium. Virent is collaborating with Royal Dutch Shell and Cargill to help commercialize its technology. Researchers are also developing highly engineered designer microorganisms using synthetic-biology- platform technologies to produce renewable hydrocarbon drop-in biofuels. These technologies are still at the laboratory stage. Massachusetts-based Joule Biotechnologies is developing an algal technology that it claims is fundamentally different from other algae-based systems. First, Joule is using a different type of engineered microorganisms (prokaryotic rather than eukaryotic microorganisms that fit the scientific definition of algae). Joule s engineered microorganisms directly produce and secrete liquid hydrocarbons in a continuous, single-step process. Other custom-designed biofuels developers include two California start-ups LS , Inc. and Amyris, Inc. Both companies are focusing on high-value fuel products such as high-quality diesel and jet-fuel formulations as well as specialty biochemicals from plant sugar sources. A fundamental challenge will be scaling up the processes and using more sustainable feedstock sources. Artificial Photosynthesis Researchers are in the early stages of developing fundamentally new technology to make liquid fuels directly from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide similar to photosynthesis in plants. Although still in its infancy, the technology has long-term potential to replace the use of biomass-based fuels and thus free up agricultural land for the production of food. A report by the DOE s Basic Energy Sciences This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Advisory Committee identified fuels-from-sunlight technology as a key strategic goal to help transform US dependence on imported oil and limit rising emissions of carbon dioxide. The ultimate aim for artificial photosynthesis is to produce large amounts of fuels that are as easy to store, ship, and use as current petroleum-based transportation fuels. In , the DOE began funding the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP), led by the California Institute of Technology, to lay the groundwork for creating a direct-solar-fuels industry within five years. JCAP s mission is to demonstrate a scalable, robust, and cost-effective, solar-fuels generator to produce fuel derived from solar energy ten times more efficiently than can current crops including corn, sugarcane, and switchgrass. Developing practical and economically viable solar-fuel-generation systems requires deeper scientific understanding than exists today as well as the development of new materials and processes for the transfer of energy among light, electricity, and chemical fuels at the atomic and molecular level. Many researchers are initially working on producing hydrogen in solar-fuel devices with later efforts to produce natural gas, methanol, gasoline, or diesel fuels. Daniel Nocera and his research team at MIT have demonstrated artificial-leaf systems made from inexpensive components nickel and cobalt catalysts incorporated into a silicon photovoltaic cell and electronics.

Annex H Emerging Post-Harvest Technologies The productivity of the agricultural industry depends to some extent on what happens to a food product after it is harvested. Postharvest losses for grain products are to percent and for fresh fruits and vegetables to percent in developed countries and to percent in developing countries. Causes of these losses include microbiological deterioration, mechanical damage of processing equipment, insect infestation, and over-ripening. Post-harvest technology (PHT) consists of three elements: Primary processing: Removes foreign matter and immature and damaged product; stabilizes the product by drying, refrigeration or fumigation; segregates the product into different grades Secondary processing: Converts the raw material from primary processing to a product suitable for consumer preparation Tertiary processing: Converts the product of secondary processing into a ready-to-eat product. Most of the post-harvest losses occur in primary processing; the secondary and tertiary processing focus more on the nutrition and safety of food products. All of PHT research receives only about percent of the total research funding directed at the agricultural industry, whereas agriculture production receives the remaining percent. The research effort aimed at reducing losses in primary processing is limited, takes place mostly in developing countries, and relates mostly to fruit and vegetable crops. PHT is not likely to produce any breakthrough technologies by ; however technologies applied in the developed countries will increasingly diffuse to developing countries. Primary Processing Technologies Controlled Atmosphere Storage. The horticultural industry in developed countries has used controlled atmosphere (CA) storage for decades. It consists of controlling the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide atmosphere as well as the temperature and humidity for the storage of fruits or vegetables. CA provides stability during long-term storage and preserves quality by slowing down the respiration rate of the fruits or vegetables. Each fruit or vegetable requires a different atmospheric composition, but typical concentrations are - percent oxygen, - percent carbon dioxide, and the remainder nitrogen. Storage warehouses keep the temperature near degrees Celsius and vary storage from one to six months. Most of the CA research on fruits and vegetables has been aimed at finding the optimum conditions for storage of particular species of fruits and vegetables. CA has been quite successful at reducing losses of fruits and vegetables by extending the time of availability as well as extending the geographic market availability. There is no evidence that any breakthrough in this technology will occur before . R&D is likely to continue to refine the conditions of storage for various fruits and vegetables and extend the technology to more developing countries. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Modified Atmosphere Packaging By extending the shelf life of perishable food products, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) has contributed to reducing losses of agricultural products in the distribution chain. The MAP process changes the composition of the internal atmosphere of packaged meat products, seafood, or fruits and vegetables. In the case of meat products and seafood, the composition is mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen, which inhibits the growth of bacteria. Some oxygen ( - percent) needs to remain in packages of fruits and vegetable to avoid anaerobic respiration. The polymer packaging films are the key to this technology. Meat products and seafood use barrier films that prevent exchange of gases, whereas respiring fruits and vegetables require exchange of gases and use permeable films. The development of films that allow selective permeation of gases has been an advance in MAP technology in the last years that allows further extension of shelf life. Disinfestation Technologies. The USDA has an ongoing research program seeking alternatives to widely used methyl bromide, which is being phased out because of EPA regulations. CA has been proposed as a substitute for fumigation by methyl bromide, which is highly toxic, potentially a mutagen and carcinogen, and depletes ozone. Grains can be disinfested by adding pure carbon dioxide or combustion gas and oxygen or by using hermetic storage where the natural respiration of grains will subside. Scientists at USDA are testing chemical and non-chemical means of disinfestations of both durable commodities (dried fruits and nuts) and perishable commodities (fresh fruit and vegetables). Irradiation Technology. Applying electron beam, gamma rays or x-rays to harvested products inactivates microorganisms (Salmonella, E. coli, Campylbacter, and Listeria) that cause foodborne illnesses, reduces post-harvest losses due to insects and spoilage, and extends the shelf life of perishable foods. The technology has been tested for almost a century without showing any risks to human health. Commercialization has been limited, however, because of public concerns about radiation effects on food products. The large number of scientific studies showing no ill effects has led to domestic and international standards for irradiated foods. In the United States, the FDA regulates irradiation as a food additive so that its safety must be verified before any commercial application. According to FAO and IAEA, more than countries have regulations allowing the use of irradiation for at least one product. Most of the applications are related to the control of insect pests especially for internationally traded products. Given the current level of commercialization and regulatory control, irradiation will probably replace other methods of disinfestation by and find wider use in extending shelf life of some perishable products. Postharvest Biocontrol. Applying microorganisms that interfere with other spoilage microorganisms to perishable food products is a post-harvest biocontrol that is being proposed as a substitute for chemical fungicides. Although post-harvest biocontrol research has been ongoing for over years, it has had only limited commercialization. Pseudomonas syringae has been developed to control spoilage of potatoes and sweet potatoes and Metschnikowia fructicola for sweet potato and carrots. The complex mechanisms of the biocontrol microorganisms include nutrient and space competition, parasitism, induction of resistance in the food product, and volatile metabolites. Because the understanding of the complex interactions among the food product, biocontrol microorganism, and the pathogenic microorganism is incomplete, the technology is not likely to have an impact by .

Annex I Global Agricultural Research Research Organizations The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the USDA has a broad research agenda that addresses most of technological issues facing agricultural development; over its many decades of existence, it has been the source of innovative technologies. Its research includes over research projects organized into four research programs (see below). The ARS complements the research of the land-grant universities in the United States, all of which have research programs devoted to the agricultural products of their state. Past research by ARS and land-grant universities has produced hybrid crop and animal strains, labor- saving equipment, improved cultural practices, animal disease control, and availability of chemicals to promote growth and protect plants from pests. The innovations arising from decades of this agricultural research has resulted in an increase in output of US agriculture of . fold from to with an annual growth rate of . percent. International research organizations are another source of innovative agricultural technology. The most widely know are the international agricultural research centers, supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which carry out research on various agricultural commodities, livestock, fish, water, forests, and policy and management: Africa Rice Center (Cotonou, Benin) Bioversity International (Rome, Italy) CIAT Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (Cali, Colombia) CIFOR Center for International Forestry Research (Bogor, Indonesia) CIMMYT Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo (Mexico City, Mexico) CIP Centro Internacional de la Papa (Lima, Peru) ICARDA International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Aleppo, Syrian Arab Republic) ICRIAST International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (Patancheru, India) IFPRI International Food Policy Research Institute (Washington, DC) IITA International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (Ibadan, Nigeria) ILRI International Livestock Research Institute (Nairobi, Kenya) IRRI International Rice Research Institute (Los Banos, Philippines) IWMI International Water Management Institute (Colombo, Sri Lanka) World Agroforestry Centre (Nairobi, Kenya) World Fish Center (Penang, Malaysia) In the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report on emerging technologies in agriculture aimed at benefiting farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. A committee of agricultural scientists examined about technologies that could increase agricultural productivity; they selected of these technologies as having the greatest potential to impact agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia as follows: This paper does not represent US Government views.

This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Scope Note Global Food Security: Emerging Technologies to This is not an IC-coordinated report. In July , the National Intelligence Council (NIC) asked Strategic Business Insights (SBI) to identify emerging, potentially breakthrough technologies for agriculture grains, fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish by . This effort was targeted towards agriculture products that can be used for human consumption, animal feed, energy production (biofuels), and other industrial processes (e.g. corn resin). Research was focused on technologies that would impact medium-to-large enterprises in developing and developed countries; not considered were technologies that would be exclusively used in subsistence farming in the underdeveloped world. The developed world is the most likely source of new technology that could be employed in the most advanced agriculture sectors. SBI reviewed their existing publications (Scan, Signals of Change, and Technology Maps) and other open-source material to identify emerging technologies. The timelines implied in the report reflect deployment in the developed world unless specifically stated otherwise. The year was selected as the target end point for this research to enable consideration of longer- term impacts from climate change, growing populations, continued global economic development, and technology development and deployment. This report is the third of four external efforts the NIC will conduct during to explore global food security. The first report Global Food Security: Key Drivers was a conference report introducing the topic of food security. The second report Global Food Security: Market Forces and Selected Case Studies explored market forces that will affect food security to . Finally, the fourth report will be a -plus nations study of global food security and the potential impacts on US national security. Following these external studies, the NIC will lead an Intelligence Community (IC) analytic effort to report on food security and potential impacts on US national security. Food Security Definition The World Food Summit of defined food security as a condition when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life. Commonly, the concept of food security is defined as including both physical and economic access to food that meets people s dietary needs as well as their food preferences.

Global Food Security: Emerging Technologies to Executive Summary Our Bottom Line: Technology will certainly be one of the primary means for improving agricultural productivity necessary to meet the demands of an increasing world population. However, the complex factors that affect productivity do not point to a single or even a handful of new technology innovations that can markedly impact agriculture. The technologies that will have the largest impact on agricultural productivity in the next years include the use of existing genetically modified crops, soil and water management, pest control, and post-harvest processing. By , the tools and advances of molecular biology applied to plants, livestock, and microorganisms will most likely have the greatest impact on agricultural production. The principal challenge facing world agriculture is finding the means of increasing agricultural productivity producing more with fewer resources (land, fertilizer, water, and pesticides) to meet the demands of an increasing world population. However, the complex factors that affect productivity do not point to a single or even a handful of new technology innovations that can markedly impact agriculture. The application of existing technologies (genetically modified crops, soil and water management, pest control, and post-harvest processing) will have the largest impact on agricultural productivity in the next years. By , the tools and advances of molecular biology applied to plants, livestock, and microorganisms will most likely have the greatest impact on agricultural production. Out to the extent of development and deployment of new technologies will be varied among the different agriculture sectors grains, livestock, water and soil management, aquaculture, precision agriculture, biofuels, and post-harvest processing. Grains. The productivity of the grain segment of the agricultural industry is key to meeting global food demands. To meet the food needs of the world population in , the agricultural sector will have to produce an additional billion tons of grain per year, which is roughly a - percent increase over the production of . billion tons in . With the molecular biology tools now available, plant breeders will possibly be able to achieve grain yields sufficient to meet world population grain needs in . o The advances in plant genomics come at a cost to the farmer. The cost of genetically transformed seed can be five to seven times higher than conventional seed. Livestock. Similar to plants, livestock breeding is taking advantage of the developments in molecular biology to accelerate development of highly productive and healthy animals. Genetic analysis of animals through molecular biology has also improved the quality of livestock agriculture. Water and Soil Management. Because agriculture consumes percent of the O F F I C E O F T H E D I R E C T O R O F N A T I O N A L I N T E L L I G E N C E A T A I O R E C T C E D I N L O F F I C I G E N This paper does not represent US Government views. ii This paper does not represent US Government views. freshwater supply, and percent of the world s agriculture depends on irrigation, any sustained increase in agricultural productivity by will require efficient water management. To be more efficient, some farmers in developed countries are applying subsurface drip irrigation. This technology has higher installation costs than conventional surface irrigation but will likely become the norm by . Most of the fertilizer technology in use today was developed in the s through the s. Because publicly funded fertilizer research has mostly ceased, significant development and deployment of new and more efficient fertilizers and fertilizer manufacturing technologies will not likely occur between now and . Aquaculture. Demand for aquaculture will continue to grow to meet the world s demand for protein. Based on a World Bank report, aquaculture producers will likely see growth rates ranging from . percent to . percent per year in the next to years. The key technologies required to produce this growth are all feasible today. Precision Agriculture. Because of its history, precision agriculture the use of soil sensors and geolocation technologies for planting, watering, feeding, and harvesting is bound up heavily with the large-scale industrial- agriculture practices. They predominate in regions like the midwestern United States, southern Brazil, and parts of Canada, Germany, and Australia. For precision agriculture technologies to diffuse on a wide scale in the future they will need to scale down to work well for small plots in the developing world where the greatest potential productivity gains can be made. Biofuels. Over the next several decades, a transition to next-generation technologies that convert biomass (rather than food crops) to advanced biofuels and chemicals will be essential to improve the security and affordability of the world s food supplies. Developers are just beginning to scale up the new biofuel technologies to commercial production and still face significant technical and financial risks. Post-Harvest Processing. Most of the technologies deployed in the post-harvest processing sector are mature and reasonably effective. Application of existing irradiation technology could reduce crop losses that can be as high as percent in developing countries. However, the technology has met with public resistance to its application because of fear the basic food properties will be altered. Currently many of the biotechnologies that have been commercialized face resistance from the public and regulatory agencies. This is because of concerns that pollen from the genetically modified plants will spread the transformation to non-transformed plants in nearby fields and that genetically modified foods will be harmful to human health. In addition, for many of the emerging technologies to be deployed globally, they will have to be adapted to the mix of commodities produced, production practices, and environmental conditions of different localities. Local implementation might require additional factors such as investments in agricultural research at the developing-country level as well as in agricultural human capital and infrastructure. Further, agricultural productivity improvements will require advances in other fields beyond molecular biology, including chemistry, electrical engineering, remote sensing, and computer science. The tools from these fields are not necessarily developed specifically for agriculture, but their application can make improvements in controlling the management of soil, water, crop, and energy inputs to agriculture.

Discussion Introduction and Background The principal challenge facing world agriculture is finding the means of increasing agricultural productivity producing more with fewer resources (land, fertilizer, water, and pesticides) to meet the demands of an increasing world population. Technology will certainly be one of the primary tools for accomplishing agricultural productivity improvements, but the complex factors that affect productivity do not point to a single or even a handful of new technology innovations that can markedly impact agriculture. Although plant breeding was the key technology of the highly successful Green Revolution between the s and the late s, other technologies fertilizer, water management, and pest control were among those required to achieve the phenomenal increases in agricultural productivity experienced in developing countries from to the late s. Similarly a combination of technological innovations will likely be required to achieve future increases in agricultural productivity and product quality. The primary goal of the application of technology is increased agricultural productivity. Improving nutrition of agricultural products is the secondary goal. The technologies that will have the largest impact on agricultural productivity in the next years include the use of existing genetically modified crops, soil and water management, pest control, and post-harvest processing. Molecular biology applications to plants and animals are the technology advances most likely to have the greatest impact on agricultural productivity by . Enhancing plant and animal traits by the conventional methods of cross-pollination, grafting, and cross- breeding is a slow trial-and-error process. Advances in molecular biology provide a means of making specific changes relatively quickly through over-expression or deletion of genes or the introduction of foreign genes. The advances in plant molecular biology are supplementing the classical plant genetics used in the Green Revolution to improve plant productivity. The developments stemming from advances in animal molecular biology are supplementing conventional breeding practices to improve livestock productivity. The developments of molecular biology can lead to more effective plant and animal breeding by examining the entire genome of all organisms for potential improvements to crops and livestock. Emerging Technologies Grains The productivity of the grain segment of the agricultural industry is key to meeting global food demands. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that to meet the food needs of the world population in , the agricultural sector will have to produce an additional billion tons of grain per year, which is roughly a -percent increase over the production of . billion tons in .

This paper does not represent US Government views. With the molecular biology tools now available, plant breeders will possibly be able to achieve grain yields sufficient to meet world population food needs through to . Although many agricultural products are grown, grain crops are the most important source of food in the world. Grains are used not only for direct human consumption but also for the production of livestock and biofuels. From to , annual cereal production increased by percent from million to . billion tons even though the hectares under cultivation increased by only percent. Over those five decades, the average grain yield for the world increased from . to . metric tons/hectare (see chart on facing page). Technology advances resulting from the Green Revolution that were introduced in the s more than doubled the yield and added more than a billion tons of all grain types to the world food supply. As the graphic on the previous page shows, the rate of increase in grain yield from the advances spurred by the Green Revolution is tapering off. This indicates that yield increases through will require some new technological advances to assure the needed - percent increase in grain production. The graphic at the bottom of the previous page shows the yield and yield growth rates for different world regions. The similar annual growth rates indicate the introduction of technological advances during the Green Revolution in most of the regions. The growth rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is lower because the advances during the Green Revolution were not adapted to the different soil, climate, and geomorphic conditions of that region. Furthermore, economic conditions within the region did not support the investment in new technologies. The Rest of the World includes mostly the developed countries, and the difference in yield indicates that there is potential for some increase in the other regions. Geneticists have developed specialized seeds by mapping plant DNA that can improve the control of crops by increasing yield with fewer inputs. As biotechnology tools develop through , the cost of conducting transgenic research projects will probably decrease substantially and the productivity of transgenic plants will spread from developed countries to developing countries. Although the cost of identifying a gene in a single plant was $ a few years ago, it now is about $ . and developments now taking place could reduce this to $ for one million genes. By gene identification might become routine and no longer a significant plant development hurdle. Molecular breeding in plants will likely accelerate the commercialization of new plant cultivars that have higher grain yields and better agronomic traits. The cost of gene sequencing and mapping is steadily declining to the point where these technologies will likely become routine by . Drought- tolerant maize, which received regulatory approval by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and European Commission, is an example of the application of marker-assisted selection technology that accelerates the plant breeding process. Transgenic plant technology has advanced remarkably with a number of technical breakthroughs in pesticide and herbicide resistance. However, its application has been slowed because of public and regulatory concerns about the potential harmful effects of the technology. It is unlikely to be fully developed and deployed by . The advances in plant genomics come at a cost to the farmer. The cost of genetically Transgenic technologies transfer genes with specific traits from one species or organism into another species or organism. A cultivar is a plant or group of plants selected for desirable characteristics that can be maintained by propagation. This paper does not represent US Government views.

However, based on US experience, herbicide and pesticide- resistant crops pay off. In , percent of the corn crop and percent of the soybean crop in the United States were genetically transformed. As efficiencies in developing genetically transformed crops continue to increase to , the economic advantages of using these crops will also increase. Livestock Similar to plants, livestock breeding is taking advantage of the developments in molecular biology to accelerate development of highly productive and healthy animals. Genetic analysis of animals through molecular biology has also improved the quality of livestock. Transgenic technology provides the means of inserting a desirable gene or set of genes from one animal species to another. E. coli, transgenically modified with the genes from a cow that generate the hormone bovine somatotropin (BST), produces BST by fermentation. The injection of transgenic BST into dairy cows enhances the production of milk and is now widely used in US dairy farming. Marker-assisted selection, another use of advanced molecular biology, gives scientists the tools to identify genes that can enhance beneficial traits in livestock. These include controlled growth rate, resistance to disease, tolerance of heat and cold conditions, lower cholesterol in eggs, and an increased lean-to-fat ratio in pigs. Water and Soil Management Besides solar radiation and soil, agriculture depends on two other major inputs water and fertilizer. Over the last few decades, half the increases in yield resulted from increased use of fertilizer and irrigation. Because agriculture consumes percent of the freshwater supply, and percent of the world s agriculture depends on irrigation, any sustained increase in agricultural productivity by will require efficient water management. Current irrigation practices waste percent of the water drawn from freshwater sources. Because water scarcity can limit the productivity of major agricultural crops, some farmers in developed countries are applying subsurface drip irrigation technology. However, the technology has higher installation costs than conventional surface irrigation. As the price of water used for agriculture rises in response to increased demand for scarce water resources, subsurface drip irrigation, because of its high water efficiency, will likely become the norm by . Advanced drip-irrigations systems, vapor- transfer irrigation, and hydroponic greenhouse technologies are being developed and employed to enhance the efficiency of water utilization in agriculture. Drought-tolerant and salt-tolerant plants, which are being developed by using molecular biology techniques, employ emerging technologies that can reduce the consumption of freshwater sources. Global fertilizer consumption per hectare had an annual increase of . percent in the s and is projected to grow . percent annually from to . Most of the fertilizer technology in use today was developed in the s through the s. Because publicly funded fertilizer research has mostly ceased, significant development and deployment of new and more efficient fertilizers and fertilizer manufacturing technologies will not likely occur between now and . Research work currently underway focuses on agronomic efficiency and minimization of environmental impacts from fertilizer use. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. A breakthrough achievement would be the genetic alteration of non-legume plants so that they could convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into ammonia and greatly reduce the need for chemically synthesized fertilizer. The large number of genes involved in the symbiotic relationship between soil microorganisms and legumes results in a very complex problem that has only achieved a glimmer of scientific insight at this time. Research is progressing in this field, however by farmers will likely still be using conventional plant nutrient approaches. Aquaculture As an excellent source of affordable, high-quality animal protein, fish accounted for approximately percent of the global population s intake of animal protein in and approximately percent of all protein consumed. As the fastest growing animal-food-producing sector, aquaculture the growing of aquatic animals and plants contributed percent of total food fish consumption in , up from less than percent in . It will soon account for more than half of the world s supply of food fish. Major increases in aquaculture productivity through the entire production and distribution cycle have driven this growth. Prices of many aquaculture products, including large-quantity products like carp and tilapia, have fallen steadily over the last years. Demand for aquaculture will continue to grow to meet the world s demand for protein. Based on a World Bank report, aquaculture producers will likely see growth rates ranging from . percent to . percent per year in the next to years. The key technologies required to produce this growth all of which are feasible are genetically improved fish, new feed and feeding practices, closed recirculating systems, and open ocean systems (large cages in deep-ocean waters). Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture supported by information technology is increasingly employed by farmers. These technologies allow farmers to precisely control crop and livestock production. Existing precision agriculture techniques tend to focus on discovering how factors like soil quality, water availability, and drainage patterns vary within a single field. They are then used to adapt planting, harvesting, and management strategies to address those variations. Because of its history, precision agriculture is bound up heavily with the large-scale industrial-agriculture practices. They predominate in regions like the midwestern United States, southern Brazil, and parts of Canada, Germany, and Australia. For precision agriculture technologies to diffuse on a wide scale in the future and in a manner that will have a substantial impact on global food production and resource consumption, the kinds of automated systems that are emerging on large farm vehicles will have to decrease in size and price. They will also need to scale down to work well for small plots in the developing world where the greatest potential productivity gains can be made. Biofuels The use of biofuels primarily ethanol and biodiesel for transportation has grown rapidly worldwide. However, according to many government, academic, and industry experts, today s biofuels have drawbacks. They provide little environmental benefit, consume food crops, and are expensive. US corn-based ethanol production reached billion gallons in , but consumed nearly percent of the US corn crop while supplying only percent of US gasoline demand. By , a transition to next- generation technologies that convert biomass (rather than food crops) to advanced biofuels and chemicals will be essential to improve the security and affordability of the world s food This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. supplies. Such a transition would also reduce global dependence on petroleum fuels. Developers are just beginning to scale up the new biofuel technologies to commercial production and face significant technical and financial risks. One of the biggest drivers of advanced biofuels is government policies. Both the United States and the European Union have aggressive biofuel regulations in place that include sustainability standards. We do not know yet whether nations will be able to meet their targets for producing advanced biofuels using nonfood crop feedstocks. The long-term viability of advanced biofuels depends on relative prices for competing petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuels. In addition, very high-efficiency vehicle technology, including hybrid and pure electric vehicles and hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles, will help to reduce fossil-fuel use and carbon emissions and thus will also compete with advanced biofuels. Post-Harvest Processing Post-harvest losses of grain are to percent. Fruit and vegetable losses can be as high as percent in developing countries and as low as percent in developed countries. Post-harvest research receives only about percent of the total agriculture Research and Development (R&D) funding. Most of the technologies deployed in The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires percent of transportation energy from renewable energy by and that the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels consumed be at least percent less than the equivalent emissions from gasoline or diesel by (and percent less starting in ). Also, the feedstocks for biofuels ""should not be harvested from lands with high biodiversity value, from carbon- rich or forested land, or from wetlands."" The US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires at least half of the biofuels production mandated by should reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by percent. this sector are mature and reasonably effective. Existing irradiation technology might reduce losses substantially, but the technology, like transgenics, has met with public resistance to its application. FAO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been active in regulating food irradiation. Through more than countries had allowed the use of food irradiation on at least one product. Since the technology is already dispersing throughout the world, it might have a bigger role by in disinfestations and shelf-life extension. Preparing for the Long Haul Technological innovation in agriculture is complicated by the multiplicity of parameters that affect the productivity of crop or animal herds. This means that no one breakthrough technology can assure an increase in the productivity of world agriculture. Improvements in plant and animal genetics need to be cost-effectively integrated with new technologies in the management of pests and diseases, soil, animal nutrition, and water. Furthermore these technology developments have to be adapted to a wide variety of local agricultural conditions. For many of the emerging technologies to be deployed globally they will have to be adapted to the mix of commodities produced, production practices, and environmental conditions of different localities. Global research efforts of USDA and the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR) are critical to lifting global production. Local implementation might require additional factors such as investments in agricultural research at the developing- country level as well as in agricultural human capital and infrastructure. The rapid advances in molecular biology are providing the tools to delve into the complexities of plant and animal traits. These This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Technology Hurdles Assessing how new technologies will affect agricultural productivity includes an examination of the hurdles to their adoption. Currently many of the biotechnologies that have been commercialized face resistance throughout the world from the public and regulatory agencies. Transgenic technologies that have produced pest-resistant corn, genetic transformation of crops for herbicide resistance, and bovine somatotropin (BST) produced by genetic engineering have all been banned in some parts of the world. If public and regulatory resistance continues through to , the pace of agricultural productivity gains will slow down. The cost of introducing new technologies into agriculture might also limit their widespread application. Although transgenic technology research is an ongoing activity in many agricultural research institutions, application in a particular region is quite costly. For example, the Insect Resistant Maize for Africa (IRMA) project cost $ million over a five-year period, and a transgenic sweet potato research project cost $ million. Annex J shows the cost of US production of corn, soybeans, and wheat. The higher cost of seed for genetically engineered crops will probably come down by , but until the prices do come down, there will be a slow application of genetically engineered crops in developing countries where grain yields are in need of the most improvement. The more complex wheat genome and its relatively lower economic value have also hindered the development of genetically engineered wheat and will likely continue to do so. Although precision agriculture is at an early stage in developed farm economies, its potential for increased widespread deployment by may be limited. The present capital recovery costs for the three crops shown in Annex J account for to percent of the production cost. Precision agriculture would likely add considerably to these existing costs, and it may be that the yield increases with this added technology cannot compensate for the added costs. advances have already had significant impacts on agricultural productivity and are likely to continue providing improvements in agricultural practices. However, to examine the impact of emerging technology on agriculture, one needs to look beyond the advances in molecular biology to other fields including chemistry, electrical engineering, remote sensing, and computer science. The tools from these fields are not necessarily developed specifically for agriculture, but their application can make improvements in controlling the management of soil, water, crops, and energy inputs.

Annex A Emerging Technologies for Crop Productivity Improvement As occurred during the Green Revolution, the most likely technology breakthroughs to appear in agriculture through will likely come from plant breeding to improve desired plant traits. The difference in plant breeding now as opposed to or more years ago is the availability of the tools based on molecular biology, which have provided many insights into the genetic makeup of plants and its relationship to important agronomic traits related to plant productivity. Plant scientists use these molecular biology tools, most of which have been developed in the medical sciences, to introduce desirable agronomic traits in plants. The molecular biology tools include rapid sequencing, gene cloning, gene mapping, recombinant DNA, polymerase chain reaction, and biochips. In addition, bioinformatics, which uses applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, chemistry, and biochemistry, is essential to making the plant breeding process much more efficient. Historically crop improvement has been done by selecting the best performing plants or seeds and using them for planting in the following year. As genetic science becomes better, plant breeding will be done by modifying the genetic composition of a plant through cross breeding, then selecting plants that exhibit improved traits. Conventional plant breeding has limits in that it can be applied only to plants that sexually mate, limiting traits that already exist in a species. Additionally when plants are crossed, traits besides the one of interest are transferred, some of which might negatively impact the desired trait or the yield potential of the plant. Molecular biology for crop improvement has two approaches: Gene technology converts the conventional breeding process to a molecular plant breeding process. The tools of molecular biology have produced a major breakthrough in plant breeding by using gene technology to identify the genetic origin of a trait or group of traits. This technology can accelerate the process of developing improved plant cultivars from two or three decades long to less than a single decade. Transgenic technology transfers the genes from other plant species or organisms into the genome of a plant. Transgenic technology allows a single trait from any living organism to be introduced into a plant. This technology enables the introduction of new traits not found in a particular species of plant that can provide agronomic benefits. Molecular Crop Breeding Technology Numerous molecular biology tools are used in modern plant breeding technology. By and large, these technologies have been developed in the medical sciences. The technologies flowing from the Human This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Genome Project , which was sponsored by the US Government, have been essential elements of molecular crop breeding. Gene Sequencing determines the nucleotide sequence of the entire DNA in a genome. It is a formidable task with the genome of maize having . billion base pairs of DNA in , genes in chromosomes. Scientists have also sequenced the genomes of rice, sorghum, cassava, and poplar, and the sequencing of other plants is underway. Because highly automated sequencing innovations are simplifying the task and reducing the cost, sequencing of a particular species of plant by might become a routine task costing only thousands of dollars. The research effort on maize conducted at Washington University in cost approximately $ million. Automated sequencing instruments now have the capability of generating million DNA base pairs per day. Annotated Plant Genomes follows the completion of gene sequencing. Annotation is the process in which the DNA sequences are analyzed to determine a gene location in the chromosome, the gene structure (open reading frames, exons, introns, and regulating regions), and gene function (the role of gene products and regulatory features). By using the existing genomes in databases, e.g., Arabidopsis and rice, as models, the annotation of a particular crop in an agricultural region can be more rapidly developed. By , the complete sequences of many crops will likely be known, all genes will be identified, alleles (variants) of important genes will be known, and the association of relevant genes with traits will be established to increase yield or establish other important agronomic characteristics. Proteomics complements DNA technology. Because DNA sequences alone are not sufficient for understanding how genes are transcribed and translated into functional proteins, another emerging technology derived from molecular biology proteomics provides a tool for further annotation of the structural and functional characteristics of a genome. The direct identification and quantification of the proteins from a genome has been made possible by advances in chromatography, electrospray ionization of peptides, tandem mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, and computer technology. These technologies have enabled the monitoring of , or more proteins of whole plants with reproducible quantitative comparison of different samples. Peptide mass spectrometry has the ability of identifying single amino acid polymorphisms derived from alleles, which facilitates the detection of genetic markers. DNA Markers are sequences of DNA known to be related to particular genes or traits. Using marker assisted breeding to determine the best cross breeding and progeny shortens the time of having a crop cultivar with improved characteristics by two to five years when the relationship of a gene variant to a trait is known, then the variant gene can be used as a marker of that trait. A plant for cross breeding can then be identified by the presence of the marker in its genome without the need of testing for the expression of a trait. This helps the selection of diverse parents for development of a specific trait and reduces the number of breeding generations. Although great strides have been made by geneticists in locating on genetic maps the loci linked to a particular trait using genetic markers, the measurement of phenotypes (observable characteristics such as morphology, crop or product development, biochemical or physiological properties, and product composition) nevertheless remains a lengthy process. Plant breeders need to assess hundreds of thousands of progeny from many plant crossings in multiple environments to show which loci on a The Human Genome Project matured technologies, instrumentation, and robotics for more efficient DNA sequencing.

Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) technology is a method that can reduce the effort required to establish gene-trait associations. QTL analysis uses the statistical frequencies of alleles to indicate the relationship between chromosome loci and quantitative or continuous traits. These associations have been extensively analyzed on multiple species (rice, maize, and other crops); results can help infer gene-trait relationships in other crops. Another technique that could add efficiency in identifying gene-trait relationships is functional genomics, which examines the dynamic aspects of genomics. In plants, manipulating or adding genes and then examining the effects on a trait has the potential of identifying genes that regulate a trait. Induced Mutation Breeding is a technology that has been used since the s for creating genetic variation of traits for crop improvement. Plant breeding requires genetic variation, but natural variation is limited and genes with a desired trait might not be in the gene pool. To induce genetic variation, mutagenic agents, such as radiation or certain chemicals, are used on seeds from which mutants with desired properties can be selected. Before the tools of molecular biology and plant cell culture became available, the selection of desirable mutants was tedious and took many years of observing multiple generations of field plantings. These new tools have moved much of the work from the field to the laboratory. Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genomes (TILLING) is an approach to accelerate the plant breeding process by inducing mutations in known genes in large populations of plants, which are then screened for mutations with the high-throughput genetic analysis tools of molecular biology. Crop improvement fundamentally depends on identifying genetic variation in crops. The emerging technology advances resulting from the Human Genome Project that relate human genetic characteristics to healthcare needs are transferable to crop improvement needs. Applying the tools of molecular biology to plant breeding is leading to an extensive understanding of the variations (alleles) in every gene in a plant so that the genetic diversity of equivalent segments (haplotypes) in a crop germplasm would provide the ability to select efficiently and rapidly parent plants and subsequent progeny. Key traits such as drought tolerance and long-lasting resistance to diseases and pests, however, are complex and involve many genes. Gaining that level of understanding requires a Systems Biology approach in which the dynamic interaction among proteins, metabolites, biochemical pathways, and signaling pathways are analyzed in an integrated fashion. This requires progress in computer modeling to guide experimental observations. The search for higher productivity in crops, including the understanding of these complex traits and the application of a systems approach, might be one of the ways of gaining the needed breakthroughs by . Transgenic Crop Technology To avoid limitation to the natural and induced genetic variations of a crop, scientists have developed transgenic technologies in which traits from other plant species or organisms are inserted into a crop genome. Herbicide resistance and insect resistance are commercialized seed products of transgenic plant technology in common use. A gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that produces a toxin to kill insect pests has been inserted by recombinant DNA technology into the genome of maize, cotton, and potato, resulting in higher yields and requiring fewer chemical pesticide applications. By inserting a gene from Agrobacterium that produces enzymes resistant to glyphosate, a common herbicide, scientists have used recombinant DNA technology to develop herbicide-resistant crops that make weed control more efficient. Herbicide-resistant soybean, maize, canola, sugar beet and cotton are all commercialized and herbicide-resistant wheat and alfalfa are under development. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. The transgenic development process requires a plant to go through seven steps before its modified form becomes commercialized: DNA extraction from a desired organism. Gene cloning by separating the single gene of interest from the extracted DNA and using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology to produce many copies of the gene. Gene design by modifying the gene to function in the crop plant cells using new promoter and termination sequences and adding a marker gene for antibiotic resistance. Gene insertion into the nucleus of cells of a callus tissue of the crop plant by Agrobacterium, using a gene gun or microporation technology. Propagation of the plant in tissue culture in a medium containing an antibiotic so that only the transformed callus tissue can grow into a plant. Maturation of the transgenic plants in a greenhouse and collection of the seeds. Backcross breeding to combine the desired traits of the parents with transgenic plant to produce a single line with the offspring crossed back with the parent elite line until a high yielding transgenic line is produced. About to years are needed for the transgenic line to be commercialized. Hundreds of known transgenes can affect the traits of crop plants, but few have been commercialized. As more fundamental knowledge is developed about plant genomics and the dynamics of plant cells, those transgenes that affect crop productivity will be applied. Researchers are developing technologies that can refine the process for applying transgenes to agronomic problems: Directed Evolution of Genes. Laboratory techniques have been developed to shuffle domains of genes or to generate random mutations in gene sequences that can alter enzymes or proteins encoded by these genes. This approach has been used to alter Rubisco, an enzyme in plants that converts carbon dioxide to biological molecules, and enhance photosynthesis and plant growth. This approach has also been proposed for altering Bt to provide toxicity in plants to specific pests. Gene Silencing. The discovery that small RNA molecules are active in plant development and resistant to stress has led to the examination of RNA Interference (RNAi) technology. Although at an early stage of research, researchers can design and overexpress (enhance the functionality of) genes encoding RNAs that target pests or pathogens. Likewise, researchers can silence genes that are unique to pests or pathogens and as a result the pests and pathogens cannot survive. This technology has shown some promise in control of bollworm in cotton. Metabolic Pathway Engineering. As the understanding of metabolic pathways in plants increases, transgenically enabled traits will become more common. An example of this technology currently underway is Golden Rice, a rice that contains carotene as a means of producing a fortified food for areas deficient in foodstuffs containing Vitamin A. The technology involves three transgenes one from bacteria, one from maize, and one from a daffodil. The combination of these genes gives a metabolic pathway that produces beta-carotene (Vitamin A precursor). This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Site-Specific Gene Insertion. Current transgenic practice inserts genes into a plant chromosome at random, which leads to large variations in expression of traits and the need to screen hundreds of transgenic plants to determine the optimum insertion. If one allele could be replaced by another at a specific site in a homologous recombination, then the process of plant improvement would be greatly enhanced because it enables the study of functions of specific genes. Homologous recombination requires a double strand break in a chromosome. Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) technology enables a method for making precise double-strand breaks in chromosomes for a homologous recombination of an allele. Different zinc finger nucleases can be engineered to specifically make a break at a particular gene. In addition to ZNF technology, other enzymes can be used that are capable of recombining two identical specific sequences. This technology can be used to stack multiple transgenes at a target site to provide several new traits to a plant. Single transgene insertions have been performed in rice, wheat, and corn. Artificial Chromosomes. Ultimately crop improvement will require stacking the best alleles for important genes into a single plant variety at a single locus so that the transgenes do not segregate in later generations. Although homologous recombination and site-specific gene insertion provide this capability, artificial chromosomes might be a more efficient method. The process consists of synthesizing a mini-chromosome by linking genes of interest and forming a singular loop of DNA. The artificial chromosomes are then inserted into plant cells by particle bombardment. In experiments with maize, the artificial chromosomes were regularly inherited in up to percent of the plant offspring after three generations. The technology has the capability of stacking up to ten genes. Syngenta Biotechnology and Monsanto have both formed partnerships with the inventing company, Chromatin. Because about genes are involved in nitrogen fixation, artificial chromosome technology might be a route to install nitrogen fixation capabilities in non-legume crops like rice, wheat, and maize. Apomixis. Because hybrid seeds are more expensive than seeds saved from a previous harvest, farmers might chose not to use them, even though they have higher yields and greater resistance to pests and diseases. If the performance of hybrid seeds could be maintained from one harvest to the next, the cost of seed would be considerably reduced. In some wild plant species, a hybrid genotype is preserved through apomixes, which is a process by which progeny seed are produced in a plant without sexual fertilization. Research is underway to see if transgenes can be designed to change the mode of plant seed production from sexual fertilization to apomixes. Signals of Plant Stress. Research has shown that transgenes can be designed and inserted in a plant that responds to stress and provides an observable signal indicating deficiencies in soil or water or early-stage disease. A signal such as a pigment change produced by the plant at an early stage in its development could give the farmer time to take corrective action to preserve the productivity of the crop. Biocontrol Technology Although most farmers use pesticides and herbicides or genetically engineered plants for pest and weed control, biocontrol technology is an alternative that has also been used. Biocontrol consists of releasing a specific natural enemy (parasites, predators, or naturally occurring pathogens) to control invasive weeds and insect pests, nematodes, and plant pathogens. This technology requires extensive research of a particular pest in a particular region and for a particular crop. The United States Department of This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Agriculture (USDA) and a number of universities have biocontrol research programs aimed at specific pests. The USDA biocontrol projects include control of Asian citrus plant lice with a parasitoid, control of rangeland grasshoppers with fungal pathogens, and control of the Russian knapweed with a gall midge. The EU Specific Targeted Research Project is studying the enhancement and exploitation of soil biocontrol agents for bio-constraint management in crops. The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization have an extensive list of biological control agents that are widely used in the member countries. Although biocontrol technology has been used for many decades, it might have an increasing impact in the future as concerns about the use of chemical pesticides increases. Biocontrol is a component of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which is a process for managing a pest problem that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical controls that minimize economic, safety, and environmental risks. Farmers currently use some aspects of integrated pest management and will probably include more of its elements as knowledge gained from molecular biology of pests and weeds increases, and the advantages of using less pesticide and herbicides increase. Application of molecular biology has been proposed by scientists around the world as a means of making biocontrol and biopesticides more effective by improving their success rate, robustness, and reliability. Genetic engineering could enhance the speed of pest kill, reduce the initial amount of biocontrol agent required, and enhance persistence of the agents. This technology is at a very early stage of development. As an example of its potential, scientists at the Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences and the University of Maryland increased the virulence of an insecticidal fungus by using a transgene from a scorpion that expresses an insect-specific neurotoxin. The genetically engineered fungus had its toxicity to the tobacco hornworm increased fold. Other research has demonstrated genetically engineered hypervirulent viruses and fungi as controls of pests and weeds. However since genetically engineered biocontrol is still in the early stages, it will not likely have a measurable impact on agriculture by . This paper does not represent US Government views.

Annex B Emerging Technologies for Livestock Breeding and Health In a process similar to plant breeding and protection, the advances in molecular biology are having an important impact on livestock management. For centuries, livestock breeders have been observing variation of traits in breeding animals and selecting those with genetically superior traits, such as growth rate, quality/quantity of products (milk, meat, eggs), fertility, survival in different environments, and disease resistance. Worldwide in there were cattle breeds, sheep breeds, pig breeds, and about , chicken breeds. The selective animal breeding process takes several decades to reach a highly productive livestock pedigree. Through a lengthy process, animal breeding has proved to be successful as exemplified by the three-fold increase in milk yield from dairy cattle over a period of years without any knowledge of the relationship between genes and traits. The emerging use of genomic information, however, will likely increase the efficiency of the breeding process as well as enhance the health of livestock by . Marker-Assisted Selection Technology in Livestock Breeding Genome sequencing of economically important livestock has been proceeding rapidly by leveraging the technologies applied in the Human Genome Project. Genome sequences for chickens, cattle, swine, sheep, fish, and horses are now available and provide a basis for understanding the genetic variation related to economically important traits. Similar to results in the Human Genome Project, sequencing of animal genomes has uncovered a large number of genetic polymorphisms that can be used as markers for evaluating the genetic basis of phenotypes. The genomes that have been sequenced can be used as a reference for a particular family of animals. Using gene mapping, scientists have begun to locate regions of DNA in an animal genome that influence production traits. They use molecular biology and quantitative genetics to find differences in the DNA sequences in these regions. To discover individual animals with superior traits, breeders apply Marker- Assisted Selection (MAS) technology in which Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) analyses are used to locate markers in the genome. Markers are not normally the actual gene sequence, but rather a sequence that is near the gene of interest in the chromosome. Laboratory tests can then genotype individuals to determine which DNA-marker alleles they carry. Some simple traits such as coat color and presence or absence of horns are controlled by one gene whereas economically important traits (e.g. birth weight, reproduction, meat quality, or milk production) are complex traits controlled by protein products of multiple genes and affected by the environment of the animal. This process is an emerging technology that will likely become increasingly more precise through . MAS has the potential of more rapidly discovering superior livestock genetics and enhancing the productivity of livestock farming. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Genetic Engineering of Livestock MAS has the potential of vastly increasing the efficiency of selective breeding livestock, but it cannot introduce traits that are not part of a particular animal species as can genetic engineering of animals. The technology has been available for almost years, and it has evolved from a very inefficient level at which only to percent of the offspring were transgenic because the pronuclear microinjection into an animal egg immediately after fertilization produced random integration of the transgene in the genome. The introduction of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology greatly advanced the transgenic modification of animals. This technology consists of inserting a transgene in the nucleus of the cell of the animal and then transferring that nucleus into the denucleated egg of the animal, and then transplanting that egg into the womb of a surrogate animal. This technology can also be used to clone livestock as was done with the sheep, Dolly. It is now the most efficient option for producing transgenic or cloned animals. In recent years, other efficient methods of delivering transgenes have been developed. Transposon-mediated transgenesis technology consists of microinjecting a transposon-containing plasmid DNA into fertilized eggs, which are then transferred to a surrogate female. This technology has produced transgenic animals with an average frequency of percent. Viral-mediated technologies are also being developed for transferring the transgene. Currently a number of livestock species with a variety of transgenes have been successfully produced using these methods. Other areas still require technology improvement, such as when a non-targeted gene insertion can disrupt important genes in the host animal; this decreases the efficiency of producing animals that express the transgene. Until the present, the only application of transgenics in animals that has been commercialized is a drug, a recombinant antithrombin, produced in transgenic goats milk. Transgenic animals for food production have not achieved regulatory approval anywhere in the world, and the technology has met with public resistance for food applications. Some potential applications, however, could benefit livestock agriculture by increasing the efficiency of production, improving animal health, and altering the nutritional value of animal products. A genetically engineered Atlantic salmon with a growth hormone transgene is undergoing the FDA approval process. These transgenic salmon reach market weight faster and use feed more efficiently than wild salmon. Another potential application is genetically engineering a pig to synthesize lysine, an essential amino acid. A metabolic pathway for synthesizing lysine is not part of any pig breed; as a consequence, pig feed must be supplemented with lysine. By introducing a transgene for lysine synthesis from a bacterium or yeast into a pig genome, the process of separately adding lysine to pig feed could be eliminated. Transgenics can also be used to protect animal health. Using a transgene from a nonpathogenic species of Staphylococcus that produces lysostaphin, scientists genetically engineered cows that produced lysostaphin in their milk to resist the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus that causes mastitis. Despite the potential for genetic engineering technology to produce major breakthroughs in livestock production, the technical and regulatory hurdles that transgenic and cloning face make them unlikely to have a major impact on agriculture by .

Annex C Emerging Water Management Technologies Because agriculture uses approximately percent of the global freshwater supply and percent of agriculture uses irrigation, technology that reduces irrigation requirements is critical to the long-term availability of water. Global population increase will put more demand on arable land and water resources. Irrigation as generally practiced is very inefficient. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reported that agricultural irrigation wastes on average percent of the water withdrawn from freshwater sources. Losses occur through evaporation, deep infiltration, or weed growth. Increasing the efficiency of irrigation for the global food production dependent on irrigation would have a major impact on water availability. Although rainfed agriculture, which represents percent of global agriculture production, does not rely on rivers and lakes for its water, technologies do exist that can contribute to increasing the yield of rainfed agriculture and reduce the need for withdrawal from surface water sources. Worldwide percent of all cereal area is rainfed, including percent of rice, percent of wheat, percent of corn and percent of coarse grains. Adopting water management technologies in rainfed agricultural regions can contribute to overall agricultural productivity. Desalination of seawater and brackish water is widely practiced and has in some cases achieved water cost of production close to that of freshwater acquisition. Even though desalination might be economically feasible for household and industrial water, it is not feasible for large-scale agriculture. Adopting technologies that increase water-use efficiency is the only option farmers have for confronting global water scarcity. Advanced Irrigation Technology Subsurface-Drip-Irrigation Systems. Recognizing the low-water efficiency of irrigation, farmers have begun using drip irrigation, which reduces water losses substantially. Drip-irrigation systems consist of plastic tubing with regularly spaced emitters or pores that distribute a controlled flow of water directly onto the ground. To avoid evaporation and apply water at the active root zone of plants, subsurface, drip- irrigation (SDI) systems are becoming the norm. Since the s, Israel has led the application of drip irrigation in the world as the most efficient way of delivering water to plants and has made innovations applicable to large- scale agriculture. In desert climates evaporation causes as much as percent loss of water in conventional surface or spray irrigation. Drip irrigation can reduce evaporative losses by to percent. Generally water-application efficiency (percentage of water delivered to a field that is stored in the crop-root zone) for SDI is - percent compared to furrow irrigation of - percent or sprinkler systems of - percent. Initially farmers used SDI for annual row crops and permanent tree fruits, but design improvements have made the technology suitable for any crop, including those not planted in rows or beds. Advances in drip-irrigation technology are well under way, especially in Israel, and the technology will likely evolve through . The major limitation of SDI is its initial cost, which is about This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. $ -$ /hectare compared to $ -$ /hectare for conventional irrigation. An additional cost advantage of SDI is its efficient application of fertilizer. SDI applies water directly to roots so less nitrate is leached from the soil and less fertilizer is needed. Other advantages of SDI include: Better weed and disease control because the absence of moisture above the soil limits seed germination and disease conditions Less concern about wastewater contaminating the crop with disease-causing microorganisms Long system life, typically years because it is buried underground and out of the heat and sunlight Except for Israel, SDI is not widely applied currently, but its high-water efficiency and likely cost reductions with improved designs will likely make it the norm for irrigation by . Vapor-Transfer Irrigation. To use salt water or other contaminated water for agriculture, vapor-transfer irrigation uses buried tubular pervaporation membranes that allow only vapor to transfer from inside the tube to the external soil. The vapor condenses in the soil where the plants can absorb the water; the salt or other contaminating minerals remain in the tube. This technology is at an early stage with only a few experimental applications completed so far. No cost data or long-term results have been published. As with any desalination technology, the issue of concentrate disposal remains. Although this technique might represent the beginning of a breakthrough in using saltwater for irrigation, we do not know how competitive it will be in with other desalination technologies to produce water for agriculture. Variable-Rate Irrigation. Farmers can use precision agriculture to save water in crop irrigation. Precision agriculture uses advanced technologies such as global positioning satellites (GPS), remote sensors, aerial images, and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess agronomic condition-related to in-field variability. A farmer can use the information gathered by these systems to evaluate precisely sowing density, fertilizer requirements, and other conditions, including the timing and quantity of water for optimum plant growth in various sections of the farmer s field. A GPS receiver provides location data in a field to one meter or less. This information, along with remote sensing of soil conditions, leads to a series of GPS maps of a field. These maps show the moisture and fertilizer levels as well as other soil factors affecting crop growth. This process has given birth to an emerging technology: variable-rate irrigation. Because of the variability in a field resulting from different soil types, topography, or multiple crops different timing and amounts of water are needed in various areas. The rate of water application is controlled by varying the amount of time water flows in the irrigation system in specific locations in the field. In a study done in south Georgia using center pivot irrigation systems, . million gallons of water per year were saved on acres, in comparison with uniform application of water on these fields. The tools to apply variable-rate irrigation are well developed and by their cost will likely come down sufficiently to lead to widespread application.

Yield Advantages with Selected Cultivars and Improved Water Management in Kamataka, India Source: CAB International Rainfed Agriculture. (NOTE: source does not explain blank cells) Water Management Technologies in Rainfed Agriculture. Managing water in a rainfed farm operation can substantially increase crop yield as shown in the table. The yield improvement with improved water management alone, even using a local cultivar, is evident. When integrated with a high-yielding variety, the yield improvement is remarkably improved. Of the rain falling on a crop in a semi-arid zone, - percent is used by the plant in transpiration, - percent is non-productively evaporated from the soil, - percent percolates through the soil, and - percent is surface run-off. Water management in rainfed agriculture involves two basic technologies: harvesting and evaporation control. Water is harvested by collecting and storing runoff and drainage for irrigation in dry spells. Secondly minimizing evaporation from the soil and maximizing transpiration by the crop accomplishes a vapor shift. Water has been stored in tanks and ponds for centuries, but an emerging technology stores water in an underground aquifer through a recharge basin or through a recharge- extraction well. Soil management to reduce evaporation using mulching, zero tillage, intercropping, and windbreaks also results in vapor shift. Greenhouse Agriculture Hydroponic Greenhouse Agriculture. By growing crops on a large scale in hydroponic greenhouses, water usage can be reduced by percent by precisely monitoring plants water needs. Besides saving water, this technology has other advantages: reducing dependency on weather conditions, maintaining consistent crop quality, and avoiding pest control chemicals. Furthermore, greenhouse enclosures that use films to block infrared and ultraviolet light reduce water evaporation and require less cooling. The economics of crop production with greenhouse agriculture currently are not established, but even though greenhouses are currently being used in many parts of the world, their future growth depends on the cost of the greenhouses and the level of automation that can be applied. Vertical Farms. The use of vertical farms for crop production, a step further than hydroponic greenhouse agriculture, would radically alter current agricultural practice for food production. The technology might be Yield Improvement (percent) Crop Local Cultivar with Improved Management High-Yielding Variety with Usual Management High-Yielding Variety with Improved Management Finger Millet - - Groundnut - - Soybean Sunflower - - Maize Sorghum This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. able to produce yields times those of conventional agriculture with percent less water. Envisioned as a means of keeping food production close to urban centers, it would have the advantages of greenhouse agriculture but also eliminate the need for additional farmland, reduce the extent of transportation of food products, and readily recycle the wastewater produced in urban centers. Vertical farming faces some foreboding challenges. It will probably not be energy efficient unless its design includes renewable energy (e.g. wind or solar power), especially since it is not able to rely entirely on sunlight. At this stage, vertical farming is a concept that envisions a radical change in agricultural production that has not been tested, giving its future adoption a high degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, a cost analysis comparing it to conventional farming has yet not been prepared. Water Saving with Plant Genetic Engineering Drought-Tolerant Crops. Another approach to save water in agriculture is to design plants that can survive and grow with less water. When a plant takes CO from the atmosphere, it loses to grams of water for each gram of harvested product. A drought-tolerant plant adapts to dry or drought conditions. Even though scientists have for years been breeding drought-tolerant plants, the genetic traits that contribute to drought tolerance are usually associated with low growth rates and poor yields. Scientists are now using the tools of genetic engineering to breed plants that can survive and grow with less water without a loss of yield. Researchers have discovered genes or molecules that they can alter to produce plants that are drought tolerant. Three approaches exist to engineer drought-tolerant plants: expression of functional proteins, manipulation of transcription factors, and regulation of signaling pathways. Functional proteins (glycine betaine and proline) are osmolytes that increase a plant s water uptake and retention. Transcription factors control the expression of genes involved in drought tolerance. Regulation of signaling pathways involves messenger molecules such as nitric oxide, which prevents loss of cell function and death when low-water conditions stress a plant. Scientists have developed drought tolerance in several large-acreage crops. Monsanto, Pioneer Hi-Bred, and Syngenta are testing genetically modified corn varieties that can tolerate periodic drought conditions without loss of yield stability. Arcadia Biosciences and the University of California, Davis have developed and are field-testing genetically engineered rice that displays drought tolerance. Monsanto and BASF have jointly developed genetically engineered maize that has been subjected to field trials in South Africa and the western United States. Without additional irrigation, the drought-tolerant maize produced yields that were percent higher than conventionally grown maize. Research on developing drought tolerance in crops has been ongoing for many decades. The task is foreboding because over genes are reportedly active in drought tolerance. Performance Plants in Kingston, Ontario is commercializing drought-tolerant corn, soybean, cotton, ornamentals, and turf grass with yields reported to be to percent higher than non- transgenic control crops. Pioneer Hi-Bred began selling drought-tolerant corn in . Salt-Tolerant Crops. Developing salt-tolerant crops might be a way to reduce the freshwater requirements of agriculture. Wild plants (halophytes) exist that tolerate salt and grow in saline environments. Genetic engineering to make salt-tolerant crops uses three general approaches: sodium exclusion from the plant cells, compartmentation of the sodium, and excretion of sodium. Scientists at the University of California, Davis have engineered tomato and canola plants. These transgenic plants were able to tolerate water with a salt concentration equivalent to percent of the salt in seawater, a level that normally inhibits the growth of all crop plants. The edible portion of these plants showed only marginal increases in sodium. Scientists at the University of Adelaide in collaboration with scientists at the University of Cambridge are developing salt-tolerant wheat, rice, and barley. They modified genes This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. involved with the conduction of water in the plant so that salt is removed before transpiration and does not enter the plant shoot. Scientists at Arcadia Biosciences in Davis, California are developing technology that allows plants to have normal yields and quality in saline conditions. They expect the technology to be widely applicable to various crops, including corn, rice, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa, vegetable, and turf. Although this salt-tolerant crop technology would reduce the need for freshwater in some agricultural regions, it currently has been only tested in field trials. It has not been tested in long-term trials to see whether the technology has adverse effects. Furthermore, regulatory approval has not yet been sought for genetically engineered salt-tolerant crops. The technology faces many hurdles before it can be commercialized, which is unlikely by . This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views.

Annex D Emerging Technologies in Soil Management Soil productivity depends on how well the soil provides the physical, chemical, moisture, and biological conditions to sustain plant growth. In searching for increased agricultural productivity, scientists are examining technologies that restore and maintain the physical structure of soils, improve the efficiency of water and nutrient use, and enhance the rhizosphere where microbes interact with plant roots. The content and structure of soils varies considerably in different regions, as does the climate, so that localized soil management technologies are necessary. Current agricultural practices include a number of technologies for maintaining soil productivity and improving soil nutrition: mulching, application of manure, crop rotation, contouring, conservation tillage and nontilling, irrigation control, soil nutrient management, biological nitrogen fixation, and controlled use of fertilizers. Soil organic carbon (SOC) correlates strongly with soil productivity, for example, in India when soil management practices increased SOC, yields increased by a factor of . . Nitrogen Fixation Technology in Non-Legumes Transgenics. Because nitrogen in soils is the limiting factor on plant growth, chemical fertilizers are used for most crops. Bacteria can convert atmospheric nitrogen to a form that can be used by a plant for nitrogen fixation. In legumes, a symbiotic relationship exists between nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi that interact with the roots of a plant to supply nitrogen to the plant. Scientists have for many years worked on ways of transferring the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of legumes to other crops like cereal grains, but have had little success. In , scientists at Recherche pour le Developpement and the University of Munich discovered the genetic element in leguminous plants that gives them nitrogen-fixing capability. This might be a first step in developing a transgenetic technology for installing a nitrogen-fixing capability in cereal crops like rice, corn, and wheat. However, it is only a first step because at least genes would have to be inserted into a non-legume to transform it with the capacity of fixing nitrogen. Facilitated Evolution. The development of nitrogen fixation in non-legumes by facilitated evolution is another research approach for developing nitrogen-fixing for non-legumes. The method entails a stepwise genetic improvement of both the nitrogen-fixating microbes and the host plant with the aim of eventually finding an effective nitrogen-fixation association. The research requires identification of dozens of genes related to the complex interaction between the bacteria and the host plant. Scientists have worked with the main cereal crops and the bacteria Rhizobia, Frankia, and cyanobacteria by inserting the bacteria into the roots of a plant or the entire plant. So far, they have gained some initial insights in genetically controlling the ability of nitrogen-fixing bacteria to colonize in plants. If either transgenics or facilitated evolution were successful in transferring nitrogen-fixing capability to the major grain crops, this breakthrough would be extraordinary in agricultural technology. However, technical hurdles that the transgenic technology faces are especially difficult to overcome: one, the linkage of desired nitrogen-fixing genes to genes providing disease and pest resistance might interfere with a plant s resistance to pests and diseases; two, the insertion of bacterial plasmid sequences along with the desired nitrogen-fixing genes might harm the plant; and three, genes might flow from the This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. transformed plant to non-transgenic plants or wild plants. Because of the difficult technical challenges and the limited ongoing research effort, nitrogen-fixation might not be accomplished in cereal crops by . Soil Microorganism Modification Technology Phytostimulation. The rhizosphere consists of root tissue, root surfaces, and the soil influenced by the root. Microbes exist in this environment on plant roots and soil surfaces in thin water biofilms. The rhizosphere is different from the bulk soil biologically and chemically, and the effects of plant pathology and growth promoting microorganisms affect the yield and quality of crops. Research on the rihizosphere has indicated that modifying soil microorganisms might reduce the need for fertilizer and pesticides and stimulate growth. Phytostimulation refers to the technology of stimulating the effect of the rhizosphere on plant health and growth. Farmers use soil inoculants to enhance crop growth and yield, but the relationship between plants and rhizosphere microorganisms is not well understood. Application of molecular biology to the microorganisms of the rhizosphere might lead to increases in crop yield. For example, scientists have shown that the phytohormones of cyanobacteria can improve the growth and yield of wheat plants. Disease-Suppressive Soils. Scientists have discovered that some groups of soil microorganisms can protect plants and suppress plant pathogens. Because many of these organisms cannot be cultured in a laboratory, metagenomic analysis has been used to study them in their natural environment, identify them, and use them in soil inoculants. Further developments in this area might lead to better control of plant diseases and reduce the need for pesticides. Phosphorous Uptake. Another key input to plant growth is phosphorous, which must be externally supplied to the plant. Phosphorous uptake in plants is very inefficient because much of it is locked up in the soil and is unavailable to the plant. The plant recovers only to percent of the applied phosphorous. In addition the world supply of phosphorous used in fertilizers is limited with forecasts projecting its total depletion before the end of the century. Bacteria and fungi can also enhance phosphorous uptake, but so far progress has been limited in developing this technology. Research on the relationship between crops and phosphorous uptake organisms might eventually lead to major improvement in phosphorus fertilizer efficiency. However, in view of the limited progress so far, this development is unlikely by . Nano-Particles. Zeolites are used as soil amendments to improve the efficiency of fertilizer, improve water infiltration and retention, and retain nutrients for plants. Research on zeolites has focused on changing its molecular structure to improve its effectiveness. Some researchers are investigating nanotechnology as a way to improve the performance of zeolites. The atom-by-atom arrangement in nanotechnology enables the ability to control the size, shape, and orientation for reaction with soil or plant tissue. The soil applications of nanotechnology that have been proposed include nanoporous zeolites for slow release of fertilizer and water, nanocapsules for controlled release of herbicide and pesticide delivery, and nanosensors for pest detection. Concern about the health effects of nano-particles is growing, and some organizations have advocated not using them in soils until their safety has been established.

Annex E Emerging Technologies in Aquaculture Fish food supplies have grown significantly since , fueled by the rapid increase in aquaculture the growing of aquatic animals and plants for food. It is increasing at an annual rate of . percent since , compared to the annual rate of increase for the world s population of . percent. As an excellent source of affordable, high-quality animal protein, fish accounted for approximately percent of the global population s intake of animal protein in and approximately percent of all protein consumed. With capture-fish production stagnating, the increase in demand for fish products will have to be met by aquaculture. As the fastest growing animal-food-producing sector, aquaculture s contribution to total food fish consumption has increased from less than percent in to percent in , and will soon account for more than half of the world s supply of food fish. The Asia-Pacific region dominates aquaculture, which accounts for percent of production in terms of quantity. Per capita supply of food fish from aquaculture increased from . kg in to . kg in , an average annual growth rate of . percent. In a World Bank report, all forecast scenarios where stagnating capture-fish production was a key assumption showed the demand for aquaculture would continue to grow to , with growth rates ranging from . percent to . percent per year. Major increases in aquaculture productivity through the entire production and distribution cycle have driven the growth in aquaculture. Key developments have included advances in fish seeds (genetically improved fish), fish nutrition, and disease control; the developments of new forms of aquaculture; the integration with farming and waste disposal systems; and the development of a global supply, distribution, and retain chain. In Asia, many large processors have established large centralized processing plants to improve yields and respond better to evolving quality and safety requirements. Improved processing technologies also contribute to better utilization of fish waste for a wide variety of uses, including water treatment, cosmetics, agrochemicals, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals. As a result of the productivity improvements and significant output increases, prices of many aquaculture products, including large quantity products like carp and tilapia, have fallen steadily over the last years. Through to , four technologies will fuel the growth in supply of aquaculture and very likely falling prices: Genetically Improved Fish. Genetic improvement of cultured species will likely continue to improve aquaculture productivity and reduce the impact on the environment. Culture biology advancements and genetic improvements focus on the domestication of new species, development of new rearing methods in hatcheries, and development of new breeding stocks to increase the yield and help reduce disease and requirements for feed, space, and water. In , Gjedrem of the Institute of Aquaculture Research in Norway estimated that only percent of aquaculture production was based on genetically improved fish and shellfish, but expects this percentage to increase by . Nutrition, Feeds, and Feeding Practices. Feed is typically the largest cost item in commercial aquaculture systems in which animals are fed, accounting for approximately percent of total costs. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Research is continuing on the development of alternative ingredients to fish meal and fish oil, such as chicken-processing waste or plant products like soybean and canola; the development of optimized high- efficiency, low-polluting diet formulations; and more precise, automated feed delivery systems. Salmon farmers, for example, have reduced the food-conversion ratio (ratio of the total weight of feed eaten by a crop of fish from the time they are purchased as juveniles to the time they are harvested to the weight of the fish at harvest) from : in the s to . : in the first decade of the st Century, resulting in substantial savings in cost and reduction in wastes discharged. Gains in the future will likely reduce this ratio to below : . Closed Recirculating Systems. Aquaculture is leveraging advances in biological processes and the complex interactions among nutrients, bacteria, and cultured organisms to engineer closed aquaculture systems that will even allow farming of marine organisms at locations far from the sea. In recirculating systems, some or all of the water in a fish culture facility is reused to control better the rearing environment, minimize water usage, effectively remove waste products from the system, and provide for more efficient heating and cooling of the water. A key advantage of these closed systems is the isolation of the aquaculture systems from the natural ecosystems, minimizing the risk of disease or genetic impacts on the environment. Recirculating systems have been producing eels in Denmark for many years, helping Denmark to be a leading eel producer in Europe. Coinciding with the development of large-scale recirculating technology will be the development of alternative fish feeds that use plant-based proteins to replace fish meal and fish oil. Open Ocean Systems. With oceans occupying most of the earth s surface, the use of open ocean systems could dramatically change the nature of human food production. Today most ocean aquaculture takes place in protected coastal areas. However, inshore experiences and technology from marine engineering and the offshore oil and gas industry will likely combine to facilitate the use of large cages or containment structures in open seas for rearing and harvesting fish. The key barriers will be the costs of the large offshore installations and the challenge of minimizing the potential for environmental impacts from those facilities when in operation. To withstand the harsh conditions offshore, mechanization of key tasks will be required to minimize human involvement, continuous monitoring of key environmental conditions and fish behavior and health will be needed to ensure productive and efficient operations, and surface containment structures that can survive rough seas or below-the-surface facilities will be required. The engineering knowledge exists to design large-scale open-ocean farms. Since , several early commercial designs have been deployed around the world, including in the United States. A UK water analysis in concluded a large open ocean farm in UK waters would be economically viable for fast- growing species of marine finfish. A NOAA Technical Memorandum in also highlighted the current commercial potential of open-ocean systems. This paper does not represent US Government views.

Annex F Emerging Precision Agriculture Technologies Precision agriculture encompasses a range of related technologies and practices that help farmers understand and manage land variations that can affect crop growth. Existing precision agriculture techniques tend to focus on discovering how factors like soil quality, water availability, drainage patterns, and the like vary within a single field, and then adapting planting, harvesting, and management strategies to address those variations. Information about within-field variations can come from a range of sources, including sampling and testing; handheld, equipment-mounted, or field-distributed sensors; or ground- based, aerial, or satellite-based surveys. Management strategies can vary widely in sophistication, aim to increase crop yields, or reduce the consumption of costly inputs like seed, fertilizer, and herbicides. Precision agriculture s focus on understanding and adapting to within-field variations likely results from various factors that helped fuel precision agriculture s development. Although crop scientists have long been experimenting with methods to leverage information from aerial and satellite photographs and field surveys to inform crop-management practices, precision agriculture techniques did not begin to see widespread adoption until the s, when changes in the US agribusiness landscape began to increasingly favor very large farms and high levels of vertical integration. As farm fields grew, conventional field-management methods that treated each field as a monolithic entity gave way to alternative management techniques that emphasized understanding of intra-field variations and their impacts on crop yield. At the same time, satellite-navigation systems were falling rapidly in price, and the various information-technology resources necessary to generate, update, and leverage customized field maps were becoming accessible to and affordable by commercial farmers. Because of its development history, precision agriculture is bound up heavily with the large-scale industrial-agriculture practices that predominate in regions like the midwestern United States, southern Brazil, and parts of Canada, Germany, and Australia. Relatively low capital costs, high land availability, and an emphasis on efficiency (including labor-efficiency) help motivate farmers in these regions to purchase larger and more sophisticated farm vehicles that integrate precision agriculture technologies. Although some precision agriculture techniques can be employed on small-scale farms that rely on human labor instead of mechanical labor, the most advanced precision agriculture technologies rely on a very high level of automation not just in terms of application but also in terms of decisionmaking. The capital recovery costs for US corn (maize), soybeans, and wheat shown in Annex J account for to percent of the production cost. Precision agriculture would likely add considerably to these existing costs, and it may be that by the yield increases with this added technology cannot compensate for the added costs. For precision agriculture technologies to diffuse on a wide scale in the future and in a manner that will have a substantial impact on global food production and resource consumption, the kinds of automated guidance and application systems that are emerging on large farm vehicles will have to decrease in size and cost to also work well in small-scale plots in the developing world, where the greatest potential productivity gains can be made. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. The following overview of precision agriculture technologies illustrates a potential pathway of progression that could see mechanized agriculture undergo a dramatic transformation that would make it suitable for application almost anywhere. Basic Elements: Mapping and Managing In many respects, satellite-navigation receivers are a foundational technology for precision agriculture and have the most widespread adoption of all precision agriculture technologies. Such receivers typically use signals from the US Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation, together with correction signals from a fixed ground-based transmitter to provide the kind of extremely accurate location information that is important for precision agriculture applications. One of the most common uses of GPS receivers in precision agriculture is generating geo-referenced soil maps. Farmers use handheld GPS receivers to mark the precise within-field locations of soil samples, and then correlate soil samples and GPS coordinates in a geographic information systems (GIS) database. Various technologies and techniques are available for measuring soil properties, including laboratory testing of samples, probes that can measure soil s electrical conductivity (to determine water content), and handheld pH meters (many of which integrate or connect to GPS receivers to produce geo-referenced data without requiring the farmer to input such data separately). Many sensors can also mount on vehicles to facilitate faster testing in large fields. Remote sensors can also take continuous measurements of soil quality indicators and transmit those measurements for incorporation in a central database. GPS and GIS are also used to measure and map indicators of crop health and vigor, and as with soil sampling, a wide range of sensors and methods can be used to conduct such geo-referenced measurements. For example, handheld and vehicle-mounted sensors are available that can measure the chlorophyll content in crop leaves by measuring the light energy reflected off the leaves. Low chlorophyll content can indicate nutrient deficiency, plant diseases, or other problems. Similar sensors are available for measuring other health indicators including crop temperature (which can indicate water deficiencies), sugar content (to help determine the ripeness of fruit), and insect infestation. Farmers can use geo-referenced monitoring data to support site-specific field management practices that vary the application of crop inputs (seed, fertilizer, and pesticide) based on factors like crop vigor and soil fertility. A common technique for site-specific input management is to break down a field into management zones and then calculate the optimal distribution of inputs within each zone. The zone method is popular because it is relatively easy to use with imprecise application systems that disperse uniform amounts of inputs in a broadcast pattern. Calculating required inputs is typically the job of specialized software that often requires expensive licenses. However, inputs can be calculated manually using formulas, assuming the farmer possesses the requisite knowledge. A major ongoing issue with precision agriculture is determining what levels of inputs are appropriate for various field conditions. Current recommended formulas generally are based on many decades worth of crop science research. However, they are typically used for conventional whole-field management on a region-by-region basis, and are not necessarily well suited for the much smaller scale management techniques in use in precision agriculture. Researchers are developing new suites of algorithms that are tailored for precision agriculture applications and can be customized to conditions within individual fields regardless of region. Unlike many precision agriculture technologies, geospatial-referenced input mapping might be relatively straightforward to adapt to work with the kind of small-scale farming operations that are common within the developing world.

Because of their centrality to both mechanized and possible future nonmechanized precision agriculture, mapping and recommendation technologies are likely to become the most critical precision agriculture components. The First Integrated Systems: Yield Monitors Yield monitors, the first integrated precision agriculture solutions to emerge, became available on combine harvesters in the s and are currently the most popular type of integrated precision agriculture system. A typical yield monitor uses an impact sensor to measure the flow of processed grain as it enters a harvester s grain tank. A separate sensor measures the grain s moisture level to help correct for moisture-induced variations in grain mass, thereby improving the reliability of the grain-flow measurement. Yield monitors enable farmers to track yields with considerably more accuracy than is possible using legacy methods (such as weighing grain at the time of sale to a downstream processor). Such accurate yield data help farmers manage the business aspects of running a farm, such as negotiating crop leases. Farmers also have used moisture sensor components in yield monitors to gather information about crop conditions that can inform subsequent planting strategies and crop-handling practices. Yield monitors become a far more powerful tool when combined with satellite-navigation information and mapping software. Combine harvesters equipped with both yield monitors and GPS systems can correlate instantaneous yield measurements with precise locations within a field. Specialized software can then use those correlated data to generate yield maps, which can show farmers which areas of the field generate exceptionally high or low-yield levels. Yield maps can help farmers troubleshoot a wide range of issues with their fields that they would otherwise have had great difficulty in uncovering using other techniques like geo-referenced soil mapping. For example, a low-yield area of a field that also produces grain with unusually high moisture content might have drainage problems. Yield monitoring can also help farmers track the results of experimentation with different planting strategies and management techniques to determine what works best for specific areas of their fields. Emerging Technologies: Variable-Rate Application and Automated Guidance One of the most significant developments in integrated precision agriculture systems to occur in the past decade was the introduction of variable-rate application systems for fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, and herbicides. Such systems replace conventional fixed-rate application systems on farm implements or purpose-specific vehicles. Variable-rate systems can allow a farmer to deliver a targeted dose of crop inputs precisely where they are needed. The most basic variable-rate application systems are controller- operated, meaning that a farmer must manually adjust the system s outputs when the vehicle s navigation system indicates that it is entering a new management zone. Increasingly, variable-rate application systems link directly to a vehicle s onboard GPS/GIS systems and modulate input dispersion rates based on mapping data. The most advanced systems use on-the-go sensing and application technology, in which implement- or tractor-mounted sensor arrays measure crop status indicators dynamically and direct spray nozzles or other variable-rate applicators to deliver appropriate inputs to address problems. For example, an herbicide-spraying implement equipped with on-the-go technology can identify weeds using optical sensors and deliver just enough targeted herbicide to kill each weed using articulated spray heads. On-the-go sensing and application systems can also leverage data from mapping databases to This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. improve accuracy and responsiveness, and the sensors inputs can, in turn, provide valuable information to update those databases to facilitate future decision support. Farmers frequently pair variable-rate application systems with guidance systems that help keep tractors and implements on course within a field, reducing farmer workload while improving the accuracy of variable-rate application. Even without variable-rate application systems, farmers can find guidance systems helpful in navigating fields and determining crossover points between management zones. The most basic guidance systems supplement a navigation map display with a light bar indicator that assists the farmer to keep the vehicle on a predetermined path as precisely as possible. More advanced systems increasingly incorporate active guidance, including automated tractor steering and a separate guidance and steering system for the implement. Basic automated steering systems keep tractors on a very precise straight-line course through a field, but the farmer still needs to turn the tractor around manually to initiate another field pass. The best current systems can both steer and turn a tractor and can achieve extremely high levels of precision, directing massive farm implements that span dozens of crop rows in repeatable patterns with +/- inch tolerance even over rough or sloping fields. Future Technologies: Farm Robots and Smart Fields Future trends in precision agriculture point to increasing automation of farm vehicle and implement control. Several manufacturers have already demonstrated guidance systems that allow tractors to drive themselves, performing limited tasks like following alongside a human-driven combine harvester while pulling a grain-collecting wagon, autonomously driving the wagon to a preset point to drop off the grain, and then returning to the harvester s location to collect more grain. Within the next five to ten years, autonomous tractors will likely begin taking on a full range of roles on large-scale farms. Efficiency gains from widespread use of automated guidance and on-the-go sensing and application technology might help autonomous farming become much more profitable than conventional farming, spurring increased investment in autonomous farming technologies. More importantly, once the benefits of autonomous farming become well established, experts widely expect that efficiency-driven trends toward ever-bigger farm vehicles will reverse themselves. Many experts expect that efficiency concerns will instead favor deployment of large swarms of small, specialized farm robots that will work on small sections of field at a time, perhaps hours a day. Each vehicle will equip sufficient sensors and software (either through onboard control systems or data links to remote systems) to allow it to manage its field section in an optimal way. Together with distributed sensor networks that monitor soil and crop conditions and the software that integrates data gathering and command-and-control, future smart fields could all but farm themselves. Among other things, economies of scale that could result from a proliferation of smart fields in the developed world might help make mechanized precision agriculture more feasible in smallholder- and urban-agriculture contexts, dramatically increasing the amount of land undergoing high-intensity, high-yield cultivation in the future. The path from autonomous tractors to farm robots might not be a smooth one. Experts have noted that autonomous farm vehicles present novel safety and security concerns. Although autonomous farm machines might operate far more safely than human-driven machines, accidents still might occur. Depending on jurisdiction, a court might have a relatively easy time applying current product liability laws to a future case in which an autonomous farm machine injures or kills a person who happened to stray into its path. But such an incident or, especially, a rash of such incidents might have very uncertain This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. consequences public acceptance of the technology. If the public comes rightly or wrongly to regard autonomous farm vehicles as a menace, then lawmakers might act to ban or severely restrict application of the technology. Depending on when and under what circumstances such a ban occurs, and the nature of the ban, development of the kinds of farm robots that could help bring precision agriculture to the masses would stall. A related concern involves malicious actors taking control of autonomous farm vehicles and using them to wreak havoc. An autonomous tractor the size of a large bulldozer, even without its implement (which can be wider than a four-lane highway) could be a potent terrorist s weapon. Smaller farm robots might be less readily weaponizable, but still certainly present concern. A number of potential strategies exist for manufacturers to ensure that farm robots are not misused. Whether such strategies will be effective at deterring attacks is unknown. Another unknown is whether lawmakers will impose so many security- related restrictions on farm robots that deploying such robots in areas where they can have the highest impact might become impossible. Of course, many of the gains possible from precision agriculture do not require farm robot swarms or smart fields; human workers could perform variable-rate application by hand by using handheld sensors and GPS maps. But precision agriculture is much more than sensing and application; it is also extremely challenging knowledge work. Specialized software for data-processing and decision-support can automate much of that knowledge work and help make precision agriculture easier for individuals to practice. However, using such software still generally requires a significant level of knowledge. The same trends that might drive down the size of farm vehicles might also end up helping to move many of the planning and decision making aspects of precision agriculture so that the human farmer is out of the loop. In such a scenario, the self-managing smart fields of the future might be agnostic as to whether humans or robots tend to them. In the case of human-managed fields, software might be able to provide field hands with exact, easy-to-follow instructions on where to go, when and how to apply inputs, which fruit to pick, and so on. In any case, farm labor is extremely difficult and demanding work, and chemicals used on farms can be very harmful to humans. A future of smart farms managed by what are essentially human robots is not necessarily a desirable one, but the high cost of robotic smart field systems might ensure that much of the developed world uses a mix of human- and robot-managed fields.

Annex G Emerging Biofuel Technologies The use of transportation biofuels primarily ethanol and biodiesel has grown rapidly worldwide, but according to some experts, today s biofuels have drawbacks: they provide little environmental benefit, consume food crops, and are expensive. US corn-based ethanol production reached billion gallons in , but consumed percent of the US corn crop and billions of dollars in federal government subsidies while supplying only percent of US gasoline demand. Next-generation technologies that convert biomass (rather than food crops) to advanced biofuels and chemicals promise to be more sustainable and lower cost. These emerging technologies are critical to the long-term security of the world s food supplies and help reduce global dependence on petroleum fuels. This section provides an overview of new technologies and market issues that will influence the success of advanced biofuels over the next several decades. One of the biggest drivers of advanced biofuels is government policies. The United States and the European Union have aggressive biofuel mandates in place that include sustainability standards. The US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires billion gallons of biofuels by with increasing amounts of advanced biofuels that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions below a fossil-fuel baseline. A variety of advanced biofuel technologies is in development that might meet the requirements, but costs are still too high and the technologies are not yet proven at commercial scale. Achieving the RFS goals will require years of consistent government support, including Research and Development funding, tax credits, and loan guarantees that support the construction of commercial-scale plants. The viability of advanced biofuels will also depend on relative prices for competing transportation fuels. Biofuels face significant competition from petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuels, which are widely available to consumers through a highly developed distribution and retail system in most countries. High crude oil prices improve the cost competitiveness of renewable biofuels. Very high-efficiency vehicles, including hybrid and pure electric vehicles and hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles, help reduce fossil- fuel use and carbon emissions and thus will also compete with advanced biofuels. Cellulosic Ethanol Cellulosic ethanol is the nearest-term advanced biofuel. This second-generation biofuel is derived from various types of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks including agricultural and forest residues (such as corn stover, rice straw, wheat straw, and bagasse), nonfood energy crops (grasses and trees such as switchgrass, poplar, and miscanthus), and municipal solid waste. Lignocellulosic biomass consists of complex cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin polymers, which are much tougher to break down than corn kernels. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Current Status. The basic biomass conversion technologies biochemical and thermochemical designs have been around for decades, and researchers have made significant progress in reducing costs over the past ten years. Biochemical (sugar-based) pathways use acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose to create sugars, such as glucose and xylose, which subsequently ferment to cellulosic ethanol. Thermochemical pathways use gasification to convert feedstocks to syngas, which subsequently ferment or catalytically convert syngas to cellulosic ethanol and other valuable products. A variety of cellulosic ethanol demonstration plants has operated worldwide since , but developers still do not know which approaches and feedstocks will be most successful at a commercial scale. A major R&D focus is improving the efficiency of the multistep processes. For the biochemical pathways, researchers are working to improve the pretreatment process for breaking down hemicellulose into fermentable sugars. Cellulase enzyme complexes that break down plant cell walls are available commercially but still cost about ten times more than enzymes for corn-based ethanol. Researchers are also engineering specialized yeasts that can ferment the difficult-to-metabolize C and C sugars from cellulosic feedstocks to ethanol. In addition, researchers have identified microbes that that can break down cellulose and ferment sugar in one step eliminating the costly pretreatment step. Future breakthroughs as a result of these efforts are likely to result from alterations by molecular biologists to the genetic code of microorganisms in order to improve enzymatic activity and other functions. Plant breeding and biotechnology can also offer major benefits such as improving biomass yield, reducing feedstock quality variations, and increasing the performance of biomass feedstocks in downstream conversion processes. Researchers at Massachusetts-based firm Agrivida and Swiss-based Syngenta International AG have already incorporated cell wall degrading enzymes directly into the genome of plants. The enzymes activate only under biofuel-processing conditions and initiate hydrolysis of the plant polysaccharides from within the modified biomass, greatly reducing the need for costly pretreatment enzymes. California-based Ceres is developing seeds and traits for high-biomass energy crops and has identified hundreds of candidate genes for traits such as biomass yields, plant architecture, tolerance to environmental stress, more efficient use of soil nitrogen, and disease resistance. Researchers at DOE s BioEnergy Science Center discovered the gene that controls ethanol production capacity in a microorganism, which will allow scientists to genetically alter biomass plants to produce more ethanol. DOE s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy is funding breakthrough plant technologies through its Plants-Engineered-to-Replace-Oil (PETRO) program. PETRO researchers are developing enhanced crops that scan deliver more energy per acre by improving plant photosynthetic processes and producing high-energy fuel molecules within plant leaves and stems, in addition to seeds. Outlook. Cellulosic ethanol companies say they are ready to build at least a dozen commercial-scale facilities over the next few years that could supply several hundred million gallons of cellulosic ethanol. Obtaining financing for risky new plants has been a major barrier. The USDA and DOE have awarded loan guarantees to several cellulosic-ethanol projects. Recent recipients include INEOS Bio, part of Swiss-based chemical firm INEOS, and Illinois-based Coskata, Inc., which plan to start up hybrid plants that combine feedstock-flexible gasification processes with biological fermentation in . Midwestern ethanol producers Abengoa Bioenergy and Poet have announced plans to start up biochemical-based cellulosic-ethanol plants in . Government and other studies suggest that initial production costs will be significantly higher than costs to make ethanol from corn even with corn prices at historic highs. Nonetheless, one or more early developers might be able to produce cellulosic ethanol successfully. The coming wave of commercial plants will provide valuable insights and might lay the groundwork for a viable cellulosic-biofuel industry to begin to develop. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Successful cellulosic-biofuel developers will also need to build up new regional supply chains in which all of the necessary pieces fit together efficiently collecting biomass from fields or forests; creating, storing, and delivering high quality biomass feedstocks to biorefineries; and converting biomass to bioenergy products. A recent study by the DOE s Oak Ridge National Laboratory indicates that the United States has more than enough lignocellulosic biomass from forest and agricultural sources one billion tons of dry biomass annually to displace percent of US petroleum consumption by . Meeting the one- billion-ton benchmark requires adequate biomass market pricing ($ per dry ton at the roadside or farmgate according to the study) without any major changes in agricultural practices (only percent annual yield growth in corn and energy crops and current trends toward no-till cultivation). A new USDA initiative is funding R&D projects that address advanced biofuel needs across supply chains from sustainable production of forest and agricultural energy crops to production of high-value biofuels. Projects include planting grasses with legumes to provide nutrients to marginal land while reducing nitrogen runoff into waterways. Many cellulosic-biofuel developers have partnered with large industrial firms to help speed the commercialization of novel technologies. Oil companies have a natural affinity for the biofuels business, including knowledge of how to manage large-scale commercial projects and produce and market transportation fuels on a massive scale. Royal Dutch Shell is a long-term investor in Iogen Corp., which makes cellulosic ethanol from agricultural residues at a large demonstration plant in Canada. Shell also has an interest in California biocatalyst developer Codexis, focusing on the development of more powerful enzymes for faster conversion of biomass to fuels. BP recently acquired all of the assets of Vercipia Biofuels, a cellulosic-ethanol business that BP created with Massachusetts-based Verenium. Chemical giant DuPont owns DuPont Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC, which operates a demonstration plant in Tennessee and is planning to build a commercial facility within the next few years. Biomass-Based Biodiesel Biodiesel has seen rapid growth worldwide, especially in Europe. Most biodiesel currently is derived from food plant oils such as rapeseed, soy, and palm oil, used cooking oils discarded as waste from restaurants, and animal fats. Biodiesel is typically blended with conventional diesel fuel in low concentrations since pure biodiesel has a tendency to solidify or gel at low temperatures. Finland s Neste Oil produces an enhanced product (NExBTL renewable diesel) that can be used in blends in any concentration. Researchers are also developing cellulosic-biodiesel technologies that use biomass feedstocks and do not depend on food crops. Choren Industries GmbH, with collaboration from Shell and other partners, has developed a biomass-to-liquids process involving high-temperature gasification of biomass followed by a catalytic process to make a clean, high quality, synthetic biodiesel. Choren s Carbo-V process converts more than percent of woody biomass material, whereas conventional biodiesel processing converts less than percent of the mass of dried plants. In , Choren commissioned a large biomass-to-liquids pilot plant at Freiberg, Germany, and is studying the feasibility of larger-scale facilities. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Biobutanol Biobutanol is a new biofuel that is not yet commercially available. Biobutanol gained wide prominence in when BP and DuPont announced plans to produce it commercially using a fermentation process. Most butanol (for chemical uses) today comes from petrochemical feedstocks. Butanol has several advantages over ethanol, including higher energy density and immiscibility with water, allowing it to blend more easily with gasoline and other fuels. Biobutanol production processes are still at the lab scale or early pilot stage of development. However, published data on butanol-producing organisms indicate low yields relative to ethanol production via fermentation. BP-DuPont Biofuels and several other companies are working to develop and commercialize new biobutanol technologies using proprietary biocatalysts and microbes. Initially, developers will use the same agricultural food crops as ethanol such as corn, wheat, sugar beet, cassava, and sugarcane. The use of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks is planned for later and requires further technology development. Colorado-based Gevo, Inc. recently received a USDA research grant to enhance its cellulosic yeast strain and fermentation process to produce biobutanol jet fuel from woody biomass. Drop-in Biofuels Since the mid- s, many advanced biofuel developers and investors have shifted their focus to third- generation drop-in biofuels that have higher energy potential than ethanol or biobutanol and can blend with conventional petroleum fuels at high percentages without changes to existing transportation-fuel infrastructures. By contrast, ethanol cannot be mixed with gasoline at refineries or transported by pipelines. Instead, ethanol is typically transported by rail or truck and blended into gasoline at terminals near the end users, which adds costs and can strain distribution systems. Drop-in technologies include renewable hydrocarbons produced by algae and advanced processes that convert plant sugars to hydrocarbons. These technologies are less mature and costs are still high. Many developers are initially targeting higher-value fuel, chemical, and specialty markets rather than commodity fuel markets. Algae-Based Biofuels. Algae are potentially rich sources of biofuels and have become a subject of intense research and investor interest. Algae-based technologies offer major benefits including very high production rates; the ability to use otherwise nonproductive, nonarable land and a wide variety of water sources fresh, saline, and wastewater; and the potential to recycle carbon dioxide and other wastes. More than percent of algae mass might consist of bio-oils that can be used as drop-in replacements for diesel, gasoline, aviation fuels, and specialty products. The DOE was a major force in early algal- biofuels development from to . That work ended because crude oil prices were far too low for algae-based fuels to compete, but the National Renewable Energy Laboratory s Aquatic Species Program demonstrated impressive productivity, with photosynthetic algae yields in excess of dry tons per acre in an open-pond system. The DOE s latest algal-biofuels-development roadmap published in indicates that a dedicated R&D program can bring algal-fuel economics to a competitive level within ten years, although that time frame might be optimistic. Major technical challenges remain from basic algal biology to cultivation to production and scale up of integrated processes. Synthetic-biology techniques are helping to bring down the costs of algae-based biofuels by changing the way microalgae use light and improving their efficiency in producing fuels. However, growing and harvesting algae is still somewhat of an art. Technology approaches include the cultivation of photosynthetic algae in large open ponds, growing genetically This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. engineered algae in enclosed photobioreactors, and growing genetically engineered algae that consume sugar inside dark fermentation tanks. Each approach has drawbacks. In open ponds, for example, wild algae strains from the environment can crowd out highly productive strains, and high-growth algae in sealed bioreactors can overheat. Algae production is energy intensive technologies typically produce biofuels indirectly by growing algal biomass; then harvesting, dewatering, and extracting oil; and then processing the oil into a biodiesel or other fuel product. Researchers also need to better understand and manage high water-related costs. Algae can grow in wastewater, but potential pathogens can kill the algae and water-treatment technologies are expensive. For the open-pond option, large amounts of freshwater are necessary to replenish evaporated water to avoid concentrating contaminants. Some investors have begun to question whether algae-based biofuels will ever be economically viable. California-based algal-biotechnology developer Solazyme, Inc. has had success in lowering production costs significantly by growing algae in fermentation tanks without sunlight by feeding them sugar a concentrated source of energy that allows the algae to grow rapidly. Solazyme received an order from the US Navy in late to provide , gallons of its algae-based biofuel. Solazyme s recent S- filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that its lead algae strain for fuels and chemicals could make a crude oil for less than $ , per metric ton (about $ per barrel) at a commercial scale using sugarcane feedstock. Renewable Hydrocarbons. Wisconsin-based Virent Energy Systems has developed new technology the BioForming process to make renewable hydrocarbons from bio-based feedstocks. This process converts plant sugars into biogasoline using a chemical-reforming catalyst. Virent claims that the biogasoline s performance is similar to that of petroleum gasoline. The company began operating a demonstration plant in using conventional biofuel feedstocks such as sugar beets. Virent has also shown that it can convert cellulosic biomass including corn stover and pine tree residuals to biogasoline. Virent s technology is one of six different process strategies in the DOE s grant program with the National Advanced Biofuels Consortium. Virent is collaborating with Royal Dutch Shell and Cargill to help commercialize its technology. Researchers are also developing highly engineered designer microorganisms using synthetic-biology- platform technologies to produce renewable hydrocarbon drop-in biofuels. These technologies are still at the laboratory stage. Massachusetts-based Joule Biotechnologies is developing an algal technology that it claims is fundamentally different from other algae-based systems. First, Joule is using a different type of engineered microorganisms (prokaryotic rather than eukaryotic microorganisms that fit the scientific definition of algae). Joule s engineered microorganisms directly produce and secrete liquid hydrocarbons in a continuous, single-step process. Other custom-designed biofuels developers include two California start-ups LS , Inc. and Amyris, Inc. Both companies are focusing on high-value fuel products such as high-quality diesel and jet-fuel formulations as well as specialty biochemicals from plant sugar sources. A fundamental challenge will be scaling up the processes and using more sustainable feedstock sources. Artificial Photosynthesis Researchers are in the early stages of developing fundamentally new technology to make liquid fuels directly from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide similar to photosynthesis in plants. Although still in its infancy, the technology has long-term potential to replace the use of biomass-based fuels and thus free up agricultural land for the production of food. A report by the DOE s Basic Energy Sciences This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Advisory Committee identified fuels-from-sunlight technology as a key strategic goal to help transform US dependence on imported oil and limit rising emissions of carbon dioxide. The ultimate aim for artificial photosynthesis is to produce large amounts of fuels that are as easy to store, ship, and use as current petroleum-based transportation fuels. In , the DOE began funding the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP), led by the California Institute of Technology, to lay the groundwork for creating a direct-solar-fuels industry within five years. JCAP s mission is to demonstrate a scalable, robust, and cost-effective, solar-fuels generator to produce fuel derived from solar energy ten times more efficiently than can current crops including corn, sugarcane, and switchgrass. Developing practical and economically viable solar-fuel-generation systems requires deeper scientific understanding than exists today as well as the development of new materials and processes for the transfer of energy among light, electricity, and chemical fuels at the atomic and molecular level. Many researchers are initially working on producing hydrogen in solar-fuel devices with later efforts to produce natural gas, methanol, gasoline, or diesel fuels. Daniel Nocera and his research team at MIT have demonstrated artificial-leaf systems made from inexpensive components nickel and cobalt catalysts incorporated into a silicon photovoltaic cell and electronics.

Annex H Emerging Post-Harvest Technologies The productivity of the agricultural industry depends to some extent on what happens to a food product after it is harvested. Postharvest losses for grain products are to percent and for fresh fruits and vegetables to percent in developed countries and to percent in developing countries. Causes of these losses include microbiological deterioration, mechanical damage of processing equipment, insect infestation, and over-ripening. Post-harvest technology (PHT) consists of three elements: Primary processing: Removes foreign matter and immature and damaged product; stabilizes the product by drying, refrigeration or fumigation; segregates the product into different grades Secondary processing: Converts the raw material from primary processing to a product suitable for consumer preparation Tertiary processing: Converts the product of secondary processing into a ready-to-eat product. Most of the post-harvest losses occur in primary processing; the secondary and tertiary processing focus more on the nutrition and safety of food products. All of PHT research receives only about percent of the total research funding directed at the agricultural industry, whereas agriculture production receives the remaining percent. The research effort aimed at reducing losses in primary processing is limited, takes place mostly in developing countries, and relates mostly to fruit and vegetable crops. PHT is not likely to produce any breakthrough technologies by ; however technologies applied in the developed countries will increasingly diffuse to developing countries. Primary Processing Technologies Controlled Atmosphere Storage. The horticultural industry in developed countries has used controlled atmosphere (CA) storage for decades. It consists of controlling the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide atmosphere as well as the temperature and humidity for the storage of fruits or vegetables. CA provides stability during long-term storage and preserves quality by slowing down the respiration rate of the fruits or vegetables. Each fruit or vegetable requires a different atmospheric composition, but typical concentrations are - percent oxygen, - percent carbon dioxide, and the remainder nitrogen. Storage warehouses keep the temperature near degrees Celsius and vary storage from one to six months. Most of the CA research on fruits and vegetables has been aimed at finding the optimum conditions for storage of particular species of fruits and vegetables. CA has been quite successful at reducing losses of fruits and vegetables by extending the time of availability as well as extending the geographic market availability. There is no evidence that any breakthrough in this technology will occur before . R&D is likely to continue to refine the conditions of storage for various fruits and vegetables and extend the technology to more developing countries. This paper does not represent US Government views. This paper does not represent US Government views. Modified Atmosphere Packaging By extending the shelf life of perishable food products, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) has contributed to reducing losses of agricultural products in the distribution chain. The MAP process changes the composition of the internal atmosphere of packaged meat products, seafood, or fruits and vegetables. In the case of meat products and seafood, the composition is mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen, which inhibits the growth of bacteria. Some oxygen ( - percent) needs to remain in packages of fruits and vegetable to avoid anaerobic respiration. The polymer packaging films are the key to this technology. Meat products and seafood use barrier films that prevent exchange of gases, whereas respiring fruits and vegetables require exchange of gases and use permeable films. The development of films that allow selective permeation of gases has been an advance in MAP technology in the last years that allows further extension of shelf life. Disinfestation Technologies. The USDA has an ongoing research program seeking alternatives to widely used methyl bromide, which is being phased out because of EPA regulations. CA has been proposed as a substitute for fumigation by methyl bromide, which is highly toxic, potentially a mutagen and carcinogen, and depletes ozone. Grains can be disinfested by adding pure carbon dioxide or combustion gas and oxygen or by using hermetic storage where the natural respiration of grains will subside. Scientists at USDA are testing chemical and non-chemical means of disinfestations of both durable commodities (dried fruits and nuts) and perishable commodities (fresh fruit and vegetables). Irradiation Technology. Applying electron beam, gamma rays or x-rays to harvested products inactivates microorganisms (Salmonella, E. coli, Campylbacter, and Listeria) that cause foodborne illnesses, reduces post-harvest losses due to insects and spoilage, and extends the shelf life of perishable foods. The technology has been tested for almost a century without showing any risks to human health. Commercialization has been limited, however, because of public concerns about radiation effects on food products. The large number of scientific studies showing no ill effects has led to domestic and international standards for irradiated foods. In the United States, the FDA regulates irradiation as a food additive so that its safety must be verified before any commercial application. According to FAO and IAEA, more than countries have regulations allowing the use of irradiation for at least one product. Most of the applications are related to the control of insect pests especially for internationally traded products. Given the current level of commercialization and regulatory control, irradiation will probably replace other methods of disinfestation by and find wider use in extending shelf life of some perishable products. Postharvest Biocontrol. Applying microorganisms that interfere with other spoilage microorganisms to perishable food products is a post-harvest biocontrol that is being proposed as a substitute for chemical fungicides. Although post-harvest biocontrol research has been ongoing for over years, it has had only limited commercialization. Pseudomonas syringae has been developed to control spoilage of potatoes and sweet potatoes and Metschnikowia fructicola for sweet potato and carrots. The complex mechanisms of the biocontrol microorganisms include nutrient and space competition, parasitism, induction of resistance in the food product, and volatile metabolites. Because the understanding of the complex interactions among the food product, biocontrol microorganism, and the pathogenic microorganism is incomplete, the technology is not likely to have an impact by .

Annex I Global Agricultural Research Research Organizations The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the USDA has a broad research agenda that addresses most of technological issues facing agricultural development; over its many decades of existence, it has been the source of innovative technologies. Its research includes over research projects organized into four research programs (see below). The ARS complements the research of the land-grant universities in the United States, all of which have research programs devoted to the agricultural products of their state. Past research by ARS and land-grant universities has produced hybrid crop and animal strains, labor- saving equipment, improved cultural practices, animal disease control, and availability of chemicals to promote growth and protect plants from pests. The innovations arising from decades of this agricultural research has resulted in an increase in output of US agriculture of . fold from to with an annual growth rate of . percent. International research organizations are another source of innovative agricultural technology. The most widely know are the international agricultural research centers, supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which carry out research on various agricultural commodities, livestock, fish, water, forests, and policy and management: Africa Rice Center (Cotonou, Benin) Bioversity International (Rome, Italy) CIAT Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (Cali, Colombia) CIFOR Center for International Forestry Research (Bogor, Indonesia) CIMMYT Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo (Mexico City, Mexico) CIP Centro Internacional de la Papa (Lima, Peru) ICARDA International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Aleppo, Syrian Arab Republic) ICRIAST International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (Patancheru, India) IFPRI International Food Policy Research Institute (Washington, DC) IITA International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (Ibadan, Nigeria) ILRI International Livestock Research Institute (Nairobi, Kenya) IRRI International Rice Research Institute (Los Banos, Philippines) IWMI International Water Management Institute (Colombo, Sri Lanka) World Agroforestry Centre (Nairobi, Kenya) World Fish Center (Penang, Malaysia) In the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report on emerging technologies in agriculture aimed at benefiting farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. A committee of agricultural scientists examined about technologies that could increase agricultural productivity; they selected of these technologies as having the greatest potential to impact agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia as follows: This paper does not represent US Government views.

National Intelligence Council Assessments (NICAs),2021AssessmentExtremism.pdf,2021: Unclassified Summary of Assessment on Domestic Violent Extremism,2021,Joseph Biden,Democratic,Avril Haines,Director of National Intelligence (ODNI),"UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (U) Domestic Violent Extremism Poses Heightened Threat in March UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED (U) Executive Summary (U) The IC assesses that domestic violent extremists (DVEs) who are motivated by a range of ideologies and galvanized by recent political and societal events in the United States pose an elevated threat to the Homeland in . Enduring DVE motivations pertaining to biases against minority populations and perceived government overreach will almost certainly continue to drive DVE radicalization and mobilization to violence. Newer sociopolitical developments such as narratives of fraud in the recent general election, the emboldening impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol, conditions related to the COVID- pandemic, and conspiracy theories promoting violence will almost certainly spur some DVEs to try to engage in violence this year. (U) The IC assesses that lone offenders or small cells of DVEs adhering to a diverse set of violent extremist ideologies are more likely to carry out violent attacks in the Homeland than organizations that allegedly advocate a DVE ideology. DVE attackers often radicalize independently by consuming violent extremist material online and mobilize without direction from a violent extremist organization, making detection and disruption difficult. (U) The IC assesses that racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVEs) and militia violent extremists (MVEs) present the most lethal DVE threats, with RMVEs most likely to conduct mass-casualty attacks against civilians and MVEs typically targeting law enforcement and government personnel and facilities. The IC assesses that the MVE threat increased last year and that it will almost certainly continue to be elevated throughout because of contentious sociopolitical factors that motivate MVEs to commit violence. (U) The IC assesses that US RMVEs who promote the superiority of the white race are the DVE actors with the most persistent and concerning transnational connections because individuals with similar ideological beliefs exist outside of the United States and these RMVEs frequently communicate with and seek to influence each other. We assess that a small number of US RMVEs have traveled abroad to network with like-minded individuals. (U) The IC assesses that DVEs exploit a variety of popular social media platforms, smaller websites with targeted audiences, and encrypted chat applications to recruit new adherents, plan and rally support for in- person actions, and disseminate materials that contribute to radicalization and mobilization to violence. (U) The IC assesses that several factors could increase the likelihood or lethality of DVE attacks in and beyond, including escalating support from persons in the United States or abroad, growing perceptions of government overreach related to legal or policy changes and disruptions, and high-profile attacks spurring follow-on attacks and innovations in targeting and attack tactics. (U) DVE lone offenders will continue to pose significant detection and disruption challenges because of their capacity for independent radicalization to violence, ability to mobilize discretely, and access to firearms. UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED (U) Scope Note (U) As part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) mission to lead and support Intelligence Community (IC) integration and deliver insights, the ODNI has leveraged IC components to provide a comprehensive intelligence assessment on domestic violent extremists (DVEs). This assessment was prepared under the auspices of the DNI in consultation with the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security and was drafted by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with contributions from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The FBI and DHS lead the IC s counter DVE missions and are thus positioned to bring domestic collection to bear in understanding and addressing this issue while the NCTC supports them. Other IC elements, such as CIA and DIA, contribute their unique accesses or expertise, including on ties that foreign elements have to DVEs. All agencies are mindful of the duty to respect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties and to act within the authorities granted to them as they seek to put together as complete an intelligence and analytic picture as is possible. (U) For the purposes of this assessment, the IC defines a DVE as an individual based and operating primarily in the United States without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or other foreign power and who seeks to further political or social goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence. This assessment does not evaluate the actions of individuals engaged solely in activities protected by the First Amendment or other rights secured by the Constitution of the United States.

It was drafted by the National Intelligence Council and coordinated with CIA, DIA, NGA, NSA, and State/INR. Afghanistan: Women s Economic, Political, Social Status Driven by Cultural Norms Afghanistan s progress since the end of Taliban rule toward meeting broadly accepted international standards for the conditions of women has been uneven, reflecting cultural norms and conflict. The Taliban regime barred girls from attending school and prohibited women from working outside the home or being in public without a male relative. Although the Taliban s fall officially ended some policies, many continue in practice even in government-controlled areas, and years of war have left millions of women maimed, widowed, impoverished, and displaced. Roughly . million of the million Afghans enrolled in school are female. However, only percent of rural girls attend secondary school, compared to percent of their urban peers, and more than percent of Afghan women over age are illiterate. The number of schools rose more than tenfold after , but many have been shuttered in recent years by rising insecurity. Afghan women have less access than men to capital, struggle to own property, and face obstacles to operating in mixed-gender workplaces. As of , approximately percent of working-age women were employed compared to percent of men and just percent of business owners and mid- and upper-level managers were women. Progress is concentrated in cities and ethnic minority enclaves, where violence is lower and women had more freedom before Taliban rule. Gains are less pronounced in rural areas, where roughly percent of Afghans live. Progress probably owes more to external pressure than domestic support, suggesting it would be at risk after coalition withdrawal, even without Taliban efforts to reverse it. After decades of intensive international focus and funding, Afghanistan still ranks at or near the bottom of multiple UN and other global indices of conditions for women. In some rural Pashtun areas, tribal codes that predate the Taliban require women s full-body covering or seclusion in their homes as a means of protecting their perceived virtue and their families honor. Nationwide, child marriage and stoning for adultery persist, and rape victims are killed by relatives for shaming their families. A UN study in found that only percent of Afghan men think women should work outside the home after marriage, and two-thirds complained that women have too many rights. Taliban Maintains Rigid Views The Taliban remains broadly consistent in its restrictive approach to women s rights and would roll back much of the past two decades progress if the group regained national power. The Taliban has seen minimal leadership turnover, maintains inflexible negotiating positions, and enforces strict social constraints in areas that it already controls. Some Taliban officials publicly say that the group will respect women s rights, but they caveat that these protections must align with Taliban interpretations of sharia. The group also claimed April SOCM - -A [ ] during its previous regime that it afforded women all of the rights that Islam guaranteed them. Since the current peace process started in , Taliban officials have issued statements opposing alien-culture clothes worn by women and have accused women s rights advocates of promoting immorality, indecency, and non-Islamic culture. If the Taliban were again Afghanistan s dominant power, we assess that any prospect for moderating the group s policies toward women would lie with ethnic minorities ability to maintain local variation and technological development since the Taliban s previous rule. International pressure could play a reinforcing role. Successive Kabul governments struggles to extend their writ countrywide and previous resistance to Taliban rule in ethnic minority areas could lead to inconsistent implementation of Taliban edicts, whether by lack of capacity or local accommodation. Thus far, the Taliban's effect on girls' education in areas under its control has ranged from total shutdown to negotiated agreements on which subjects are taught. The proliferation of Afghan cell phone accounts about million in would offer Afghans greater access to the broader world and could make extreme Taliban behavior more visible than it was in the s. International attention to Afghanistan probably would also be greater, at least for a few years after coalition withdrawal. The Taliban s desires for foreign aid and legitimacy might marginally moderate its conduct over time. However, in the early days of reestablishing its Emirate, the Taliban probably would focus on extending control on its own terms. Previous Reforms Faced Pushback Efforts to raise Afghan women s status began long before the Taliban s fall but have met strong rural and religious resistance. King Amanullah Shah ( - ) advocated for girls education, abolished forced marriage, and restricted polygamy. His wife famously removed her veil in public and was regularly photographed wearing European fashion. However, backlash to his reforms pace and scope contributed to him being forced into exile amid violent demonstrations. King Zahir Shah ( - ) took a more cautious approach to change, including abolishing gender segregation and enacting women s suffrage. His wife and daughter also appeared unveiled, igniting condemnation from clerics, but many urban women followed suit. The Communist era brought compulsory co-ed schooling and expanded female employment, but after rural protests, the government focused reform efforts on cities.

Iran's path most likely will be nrrbulent domestically and defiant on the international stage as the regime defends its strategic goals while seeking relief from sanctions that have isolated Tehran and kept the economy persistently weak. To retain its hold on power, the regime probably will rely on its loyal and responsive security forces and use repressive tactics to control the public and a disjointed political opposition. The consolidation of power mainly among Iran's hard.line elites is likely to pose new challenges for US interests. We assess that Tehran will sustain its adversarial posnrre toward the United States in the region and would be reticent toward any efforts at rapprochement with Washington. The Iranian regime almost certainly will remain committed to developing robust civilian nuclear and advanced missile capabilities. Key Judgment : The IC assesses that increased political competition among Iranian conservatives and hardliners and the resulting power consolidation and emergence of younger elites through will widen rifts between the regime and the public, further eroding the regime's claims to popular legitimacy- We assess that the regime will counter domestic challengers, including with violence, and that it will endure as it transitions to a new cohort of leaders. Key Judgment : The IC assesses that Iran's economy will continue to underperform through , raising the prospect of cycles of unrest and repressive crackdowns. The economy's health will be one of the key metrics in the Iranian public's evaluation of the Islamic Republic's success in governing. We have moderate confidence in this judgment because of uncertainties about the future of sanctions relief from a potential Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal, oil prices, and the willingness of foreign partners to invest in Iran. We assess that the Iranian public will continue to place greater emphasis on economic opportunities and conditions over political motivations in its evaluation of the regime. Key Judgment : We assess that power consolidation by hardliners will ensure that Iran remains committed to its core policy objectives, holding steady the prospect of confrontation with the United States. Iran probably would remain wary of US-backed initiatives even following a potential international nuclear deal. During the next five years, Iran's foreign and security policies probably will deviate little from the Supreme Leader's guidance, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) will remain an unchallenged policy implementer, and Iran most likely will advance its civilian nuclear, ballistic missile, and advanced conventional weapons capabilities. Barring a substantial commitment of US military forces in the region, Tehran probably will view the United States as a waning power that is pivoting to Asia and hesitant to employ military power against Iran.

Intelligence Community Assessments (ICAs),2024GlobalHealthAssessments.pdf,"Updated Assessment of Anomalous Health Incidents, as of December 2024",2024,Joseph Biden,Democratic,Avril Haines,Director of National Intelligence (ODNI),"UNCLASSIFIED This Intelligence Community Assessment was prepared under the auspices of the National Intelligence Officer (NIO) for Counterintelligence. It was drafted by the National Intelligence Council with contributions from the Intelligence Community. UNCLASSIFIED Updated Assessment of Anomalous Health Incidents, as of December January ICA - -B Approved for Public Release by ODNI on January UNCLASSIFIED [ ] UNCLASSIFIED Executive Summary Scope Note: This Intelligence Community (IC)-drafted and coordinated Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) addresses the IC s evaluation of new information possibly related to anomalous health incidents (AHIs) since the publication of the ICA Updated Assessment of Anomalous Health Incidents, ICA - , on March . In line with the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), most of the IC continues to assess that it is very unlikely a foreign adversary is responsible for the events reported as possible anomalous health incidents (AHIs). IC components base this overall judgment on updates to the three lines of inquiry identified in the ICA: ( ) whether collection either indicates a foreign actor was seeking to target US Government (USG) personnel who reported events as possible AHIs or links a foreign actor to events reported as possible AHIs; ( ) the feasibility and existence of a deliberate causal mechanism, such as a pulsed RF energy weapon or prototype device, that could cause the types of symptoms and sensory phenomena reported as possible AHIs; and ( ) the state and reliability of medical analysis on whether at least some of the USG personnel reporting AHIs had a common set of physical injuries. In judging that it is very unlikely that a foreign actor is responsible, five IC components place emphasis on sensitive intelligence reporting continuing to point away from foreign involvement in AHIs, the IC s investigations of key incidents reported as possible AHIs, and a review of foreign intelligence and research regarding the development of novel weapons. Two components still have moderate-to-high confidence in this judgment, and three components still have moderate confidence. These components also judge it is very unlikely a foreign actor has used a novel weapon or prototype device to harm even a subset of the USG personnel or dependents who reported medical symptoms or sensory phenomena as AHIs. In contrast, one IC component judges there is a roughly even chance a foreign actor has used a novel weapon or prototype device to harm a small, undetermined subset of the USG personnel or dependents who reported medical symptoms or sensory phenomena as AHIs. Another IC component judges there is a roughly even chance a foreign actor has developed a novel weapon or prototype device that could have harmed a small, undetermined subset of the USG personnel or dependents who reported medical symptoms or sensory phenomena as AHIs. However, this component continues to assess it is unlikely a foreign actor has deployed such a weapon in any events reported as possible AHIs. Both of these IC components have low confidence in these judgments. These shifts are based on reporting they evaluate to indicate that foreign actors are making progress in scientific research and weapons development. In support of this updated assessment, IC components each revisited the three lines of inquiry they considered in , identifying judgments and confidence levels about each. All IC components agree that most of the new intelligence was consistent with the judgments reached in the ICA but new reporting led two components to shift their assessments about whether a foreign actor has a capability that could cause biological effects consistent with some of the symptoms reported as possible AHIs. This shift consequently led two IC components to subtly change their overall judgment about whether a foreign actor might have played a role in a small number of events. January ICA - -B Updated Assessment of Anomalous Health Incidents, as of December UNCLASSIFIED [ ] UNCLASSIFIED Foreign Actors: IC components continue to assess that it is either very unlikely or unlikely that any foreign actor caused any of the events reported as possible AHIs because intelligence reporting points away from key US adversaries being involved, and IC targeting, collection, and investigations have not linked any foreign actor to any reported incident. Five IC components assess it is very unlikely, and one component judges that it is unlikely. One IC component abstains. In reaffirming their judgments from , IC components note that details from events newly reported as possible AHIs and intelligence reporting the IC has collected since March point away from foreign actors being responsible. This intelligence picture is consistent with the body of information considered in the last ICA published in and all IC components agree that years of IC collection, targeting, and analytic efforts have not surfaced compelling intelligence reporting that ties a foreign actor to any specific event reported as a possible AHI. Foreign Actor Capability: Five IC components continue to assess it is very unlikely a foreign actor has a capability, such as a pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy weapon or prototype device, to cause the symptoms and sensory phenomena associated with events reported as possible AHIs. Two IC components have changed their judgments since based on new reporting that they evaluated to indicate that foreign directed-energy research programs have been making progress. One component assesses it is likely a foreign actor has an RF antipersonnel capability and that this capability can cause biological effects consistent with some of the symptoms reported as possible AHIs. The other component assesses there is a roughly even chance that a foreign actor has a capability that could have caused some of the experiences reported as possible AHIs. For all IC components, this supporting judgment takes into account two factors: foreign adversary research and development of novel weapons, especially those using RF energy; and the scientific possibility of that research being able to harm humans in ways that are consistent with the symptoms and sensations reported as possible AHIs. Medical Research: The IC continues to assess that medical research indicates that US personnel and dependents reporting possible AHIs do not have a consistent set of physical injuries, based on research published in from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that reaffirms prior medical analysis. One component abstains. No IC component calls into question the experiences or suffering of USG personnel and dependents. All components recognize that USG personnel and dependents experienced genuine, sometimes painful and traumatic, physical symptoms and sensory phenomena and honestly and sincerely reported those events as possible AHIs. All IC components continue to acknowledge that it cannot rule out the possibility that a small number of events reported as possible AHIs were caused by a foreign actor because the IC could not examine every location where an AHI was reported. Consistent with their judgments in , five IC components assess such a scenario would be most likely if a foreign actor used a mechanism based on well-established scientific principles designed for harassment, such as an acoustic device or an incapacitating but nonlethal chemical agent, rather than a novel weapon. The IC will continue to collect and analyze information that might reveal a foreign effort to harm USG personnel and their dependents and will update its findings as appropriate. The IC will focus on collecting on foreign actor weapons programs; investigating health incidents with a counterintelligence (CI) nexus; providing intelligence support to USG- affiliated labs conducting biological effects research; monitoring USG lab findings on potential causal mechanisms; and examining any additional medical studies. The IC is supporting USG-affiliated lab research on whether RF signals can cause bioeffects consistent with those reported as possible AHIs. The majority of results have historically shown no harmful bioeffects; however more recent, limited studies have produced mixed preliminary results. In support of the IC s efforts to produce this assessment, the Department of Defense (DOD) organized a workshop during which USG- UNCLASSIFIED [ ] UNCLASSIFIED affiliated scientists briefed their ongoing and completed research, but deferred to the IC on what research to address in this product. The IC chose to only evaluate published findings in this ICA and will incorporate additional research into its findings when the labs have completed testing and published results. As the IC did in , the IC identified scenarios on how our analysis could be wrong. The IC collaborated with analysts with no prior experience working this topic to identify four possible scenarios: ( ) a covert intelligence activity evading detection; ( ) a scientific breakthrough that circumvents Western scientific and ethical standards; ( ) critical medical symptoms relevant for the IC to evaluate were hidden amid more common symptoms; and ( ) early, naturally- caused incidents inspired an adversary to develop a harassment device as part of a deception campaign.
