1,Joseph Biden,2021,2021-2024,Democratic,speech,"Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good to be back.  And Mitch and Chuck will understand it’s good to be almost home, down the hall.  Anyway, thank you all.

Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President — (applause) — no President has ever said those words from this podium.  No President has ever said those words, and it’s about time.  (Applause.)

First Lady — (applause) — I’m her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different — a reminder of the extraordinary times we’re in.

Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation, and to the world to declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities.

Tonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.

I stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day
of my administration — 100 days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation — we all did — that was in crisis.

The worst pandemic in a century.  The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.

Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again — (applause) — turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.

We all know life can knock us down.  But in America, we never, ever, ever stay down.  Americans always get up.  Today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.

After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view.  We’re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again.

We have shown each other and the world that there’s no quit in America — none.

One hundred days ago, America’s house was on fire.  We had to act.  And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Malor- — Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people — Democrats, independents, and Republicans — we did act.

Together we passed the American Rescue Plan — one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history.  We’re already seeing the results.  (Applause.)   We’re already seeing the results. 

After I promised we’d get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people’s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days.  (Applause.)

Thanks to all the help of all of you, we’re marshalling — with your help, everyone’s help — we’re marshalling every federal resource.  We’ve gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000
pharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached.  We’re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities.

Today, 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site.  Everyone over the age of 16 — everyone
is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away.  (Applause.)  Go get vaccinated, America.  Go and get the vaccination.  They’re available.  You’re eligible now.

When I was sworn in on January 20th, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected — fully protected.  

Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January — down 80 percent because of all of you.  And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot.

At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse — I said, “What’s it like?”  She looked at me and she said, “It’s like every shot is giving a dose of hope” — was the phrase.  “A dose of hope.”

A dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease — wrote to me, said she’s worried — that she was worrying about bringing the virus home.  She said she then got vaccinated at a — at a large site, in her car.  She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated, and just cried — cried out of joy and cried out of relief.

Parents see the smiles on their kids’ faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.

Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye.

It means everything.  Those things mean everything.

You know, there’s still — you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans — there’s still more work to do to beat this virus.  We can’t let our guard down.

But tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements — logistical achievements this country has ever seen.

What else have we done in those first 100 days?

We kept our commitment — Democrats and Republicans — of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households.  We’ve already sent more than one — 160 million checks out the door.  It’s making the difference.  You all know it when you go home.  For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world.

A single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn’t work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.

A grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she said she put off for months because she didn’t have the money. 

One of the defining images, at least from my perspective, of this crisis has been cars lined up — cars lined up for miles.  And not — not people who just barely ever start those cars — nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.

I don’t know about you, but I didn’t ever think I’d see that in America.  And all of this is through no fault of their own.  No fault of their own these people are in this position.

That’s why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already. 

We’re also providing rental assistance — you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand — keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.

During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special sign-up period to do that — 800,000 in that period.

We’re making one of the largest one-time ever investments — ever — in improving healthcare for veterans.  Critical investments to address the opioid crisis.  And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’re on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.  (Applause.)

And in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days — more jobs in the first — (applause) — more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.

The International Monetary Fund — (applause) — the International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year.  That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.

America is moving — moving forward — but we can’t stop now.  We’re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century.  We’re at a great inflection point in history.

We have to do more than just build back better — I mean “build back.”  We have to build back better.  We have to compete more strenuously than we have.

Throughout our history, if you think about it, public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed America — our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.

The transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America.

Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity.

Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon — now we’re on Mars; discovering vaccines; gave us the Internet and so much more.

These are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make.  Time and again, they propel us into the future.

That’s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.  This is the largest jobs plan since World War Two.

It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines. 

It’s clean water.  And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water — a clear and present danger to our children’s health.

The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water.  (Applause.)

And in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs.  It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed Internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn’t have it.

This is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.

And I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would —

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Of course.

THE PRESIDENT:  — because I know it will get done.  (Applause.)

It creates jobs, building a modern power grid.  Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures — with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms.

The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid.  We can do that.  (Applause.)

Look, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers.

Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic — two million.  And too often because they couldn’t get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.

Eight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability.  If you think it’s not important, check out in your own district.

Democrat or Republican — Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern — almost as much as their children — is taking care of an elderly loved one who can’t be left alone.  Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.

For too long, we’ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: “jobs.”  Jobs.  Jobs.  (Applause.) 

For me, when I think “climate change,” I think “jobs.”

The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes.  Electrical workers — IBEW members — installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own — (applause) — so we can own the electric car market.  (Applause.)

Farmers — farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.  (Applause.)

Look, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing.  No reason.  None.  No reason.  (Applause.)

So, folks, there’s no reason why American — American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.  I mean, there is no reason.  We have this capacity.  (Applause.)  We have the brightest, best-trained people in the world.

The American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs — jobs Americans can raise a family on — as my dad would then say, “with a little breathing room.”

And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: Buy American.  (Applause.)  Buy American.

And I might note, parenthetically — (applause) — that does not — that does not violate any trade agreement.  It’s been the law since the ’30s: Buy American. 

American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs.  That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration.  (Applause.)

And I made it clear to all my Cabinet people.  Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited.  It will be American products.

Now I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.  So many of you — so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that’s so rapidly changing.  It’s frightening. 

I want to speak directly to you.  Because if you think about it, that’s what people are most worried about: “Can I fit in?”

Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come.  It is a — it is an eight-year program.  These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.

Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don’t require an associate’s degree.

The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.  That’s what it is.  (Applause.)

And it recognizes something I’ve always said in this chamber and the other.  Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t build this country.  The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.  (Applause.)

So that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act — the PRO Act — and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize.  (Applause.)

And, by the way, while you’re thinking about sending things to my desk — (laughs) — let’s raise the minimum wage to $15.  (Applause.)

No one — no one working 40 hours a week — no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.

We need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.  And while we’re doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well — equal pay.  It’s been much too long.  And if you’re wondering whether it’s too long, look behind me.  (Applause.)

And finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record.  We will see more technological change — and some of you know more about this than I do — we’ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50.  That’s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.

And we’re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.

Decades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America — 2 percent of our gross domestic product — in research and development. 

Today, Mr. Secretary, that’s less than 1 percent.  China and other countries are closing in fast.  We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future:
advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.

The Secretary of Defense can tell you — and those of you on — who work on national security issues know — the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA — the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.  The people who set up before I came here — and that’s been a long time ago — to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -– that’s their only job.  And it’s a semi-separate agency; it’s under the Defense Department.  It’s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security.

The National Institute of Health — the NIH –- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.  (Applause.)

And that would — here’s what it would do.  It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.

I’ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President — almost $9 million going to NIH.  And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I’ll never forget you standing and mentioning — saying you’d name it after my deceased son.  It meant a lot.

But so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer.  I can think of no more worthy investment.  I know of nothing that is more bipartisan.  So, let’s end cancer as we know it.  (Applause.)  It’s within our power.  (Applause.)  It’s within our power to do it.  (Applause.)

Investments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we’re talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past.  Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan.  And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal.

So, let’s get to work.  I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions.  I’d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different — they think are better.  I welcome those ideas. 

But the rest of the world is not waiting for us.  I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option.  (Applause.)

Look, we can’t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.

Secretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi — traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him.  When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion.  He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world.  He and others — autocrats — think that democracy can’t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus. 

To win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children.  That’s why I’ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.

First is access to a good education.  When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  It’s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st — in the 20th century. 

But the world has caught up, or catching up.  They are not waiting.  I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, “Okay, we’re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,” I wonder whether we’d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century.  I doubt it.  Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century.

That’s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.

The great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years.  It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years.  It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.

The research shows when a young child goes to school — not daycare — they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.

When you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic.  (Applause.)  We can do that.  (Applause.) 

And we’ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions.  The reason is: They don’t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy — all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.

Jill was  a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.  She has long said — (applause).  She has long — (applause).  If I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times: “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.”  She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort.  Thank you, Jill.

Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare.  We guarantee — (applause).  And I’m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.  The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.

Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave  and medical leave — family and medical leave.  We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world — (applause). 

No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones –- a parent, a spouse, or child.

And fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans.  In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.  Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over]* six years of age — I mean, excuse me — under — over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.

With two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family.  And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half.  (Applause.)  And we can afford it. 

So we did that in the rec- — in the — in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.  (Applause.)  

The American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle.  (Laughter.)  But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up.  (Applause.)  

In addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families. 

The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health.  And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly — how badly it’s needed.  Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care — in the Affordable Care Act.  (Applause.)  And let’s lower prescription drug costs.  (Applause.) 

We know how to do this.  The last President had that as an objective.  We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America. 

In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America — nearly three times — for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay.  We have to change that, and we can. 

Let’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this — in this body — in Congress.  Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices.  (Applause.)

And, by the way, that won’t just — that won’t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. 

And the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny.  It’s within our power to do it; let’s do it now.  (Applause.)

We’ve talked about it long enough.  Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year.  This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America.  (Applause.) 

So, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan?  I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits.  Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.  It’s — but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share.  (Applause.)  Just their fair share. 

Sometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party.  I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.

A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year.  Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit.  A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas.  It’s not right. 

We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well.  (Applause.)

We’re going to reward work, not just wealth.  We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans — those making over $400,000 or more — back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent.  That’s where it was when George W. was President. 

We’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck.   We’re only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action.  Three tenths of 1 percent. 

And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes.  It’s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center. 

I’m not looking to punish anybody.  But I will not add a tax burden — an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country.  They’re already paying enough.  I believe what I propose is fair — (applause) — fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed, and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.

When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: “Whose taxes you want to raise instead?  Whose are you going to cut?” 

Look, the big tax cut of 2017 — remember, it was supposed to pay for itself — that was how it was sold — and generate vast economic growth.  Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit.  It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.  

Instead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs.  In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. 

According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes.  It used to be in the — below a hundred. 

The pandemic has only made things worse.  Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic — working- and middle-class Americans.  At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion — in the same exact period.  Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic.  And they’re now worth more than $4 trillion. 

My fellow Americans, trickle-down — trickle-down economics has never worked and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. (Applause.) 

You know, there’s a broad consensus of economists — left, right, center — and they agree what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth.  These are among the highest-value investments we can make as a nation. 

I’ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.  

In my conversations with world leaders — and I’ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now — I’ve made it known — I’ve made it known that America is back.  And you know what they say?  The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, “We see America is back but for how long?  But for how long?”

My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we’re back, but that we’re back to stay and that we aren’t going to go it alone.  (Applause.)  We’re going to do it by leading with our allies.  (Applause.)   

No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time — from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experi- — what we’re experiencing now with pandemics. 

There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus out.  And our own vaccine supply — as it grows to meet our needs; and we’re meeting them — will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world — (applause) — and in consequence, influenced the world.  (Applause.)  

But every American will have access before that occur- — every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 — from the vaccines we have.

Look, the climate crisis is not our fight alone; it’s a global fight.  The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions.  The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent.  That’s why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accord — because if we do everything perfectly, it’s not going to ultimately matter.

I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world — China, Russia, India, the European Union — and I said I’d do it in my first 100 days.

I want to be very blunt about it: I had — my attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history.  And consensus — the consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.

If you’ve watched any of it — and you were all busy; I’m sure you didn’t have much time — that’s what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren’t doing their fair share.

The investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class.  That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.

In my discussions — in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, “We welcome the competition.  We’re not looking for conflict.”  But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America’s interests across the board.  America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state — to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.

I also told President Xi that we’ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe — not to start a conflict, but to prevent one.  (Applause.) 

I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments — our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances.

And I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated.  An American President — President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for.  America is an idea — the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal.  It’s who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we’re dealing with the American idea.

With regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we’re not going to seek esca- — ecala- — exc- — excuse me — escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true.  And they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia’s interference in our elections and the cyberattacks on our government and our business.  They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.

But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interest.  We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we’re working to do it on climate change.  But he understands we will respond.

On Iran and North Korea — nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world — we’re going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through di- — through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence.

And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan.  (Applause.)  We have — (applause) — we have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.  I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone. 

Today we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did.  We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.

The War in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multi-generational undertakings of nation-building.  We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists — the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 — and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it.  If you’ve been to the upper Kunar Valley, you’ve kind of seen the gates of hell.  And we delivered justice to bin Laden.  We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan.  And after 20 years of value — valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring those troops home.  (Applause.) 

Look, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland.  And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has — terrorism has metastasized.  The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan.  And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from.  Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond. 

And we won’t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism.  We’re not going to ignore that either.

My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation.  It was nearly a year ago, before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter.  She’s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye.  And she looked at me and she said, “My daddy changed the world.”  Well, after the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was if — if we have the courage to act as a Congress. 

We’ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans.  Now is our opportunity to make some real progress.  The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably.  I know them.  I know they want — (applause) — I know they want to help meet this moment as well.

My fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already. 

I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate.  We need to work together to find a consensus.  But let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death.  (Applause.) 

The country supports this reform, and Congress should act — should act.  We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice — real justice.  And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity — good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house.  Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans — Black, white, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.

Look, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.  (Applause.)  You acted decisively.  (Applause.)  And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we’ve seen over the past year — this past year and for too long.  I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign.

I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans.  (Applause.)  To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back.

Another thing: Let’s authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years.  (Applause.)  Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it.  It’ll close the — the act that has to be authorized now will close the “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.  The court order said, “This is an abuser.  You can’t own a gun.”  It’s to close that loophole that existed. 

You know, it’s estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America — 50 a month.  Let’s pass it and save some lives.  (Applause.)

And I need not — I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.

The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.

And in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America — 250 shot dead.

I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.  In the ’90s, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds.  We beat the NRA.  Mass shootings and gun violence declined.  Check out the report in over 10 years.  But in the early twe- — 2000s, the law expired, and we’ve seen daily bloodshed since.  I’m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn’t see bloodshed.  

More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know — the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence — I laid out several of the Department of Justice a- — actions that are being taken to — impact on this epidemic. 

One of them is banning so-called “ghost guns.”  These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm.  The parts have no serial numbers, so they show up at crime scenes and they can’t be traced.  The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass any background check.  Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and within 30 minutes have a weapon that’s lethal.  But no more.

And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it’s time for Congress to act as well.  (Applause.)

Look, I don’t want to become confrontational but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns.  We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  And don’t tell me it can’t be done.  We did it before, and it worked.

Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon.  What do you think — deer are wearing Kevlar vests?  (Laughter.)  They’ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn’t be able to buy a gun.

These kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners.  The country supports reform and is — and Congress should act.

This shouldn’t be a red or blue issue.  And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.  You can’t yell “Fire!” in a crowded theater.  From the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans.  Certain people could not own those weapons ever. 

We’re not changing the Constitution; we’re being reasonable.  I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue; I think it’s an American issue.

And here’s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America.  Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration.  For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we’ve done nothing about it.  It’s time to fix it.

On day one of my presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress.  If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security.  If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks — the vast majority are here overstaying visas.  Pass it.  We can actually — if you actually want to solve a problem, I’ve sent a bill to take a close look at it. 

We have to — also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to — to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.


When I was President, my President — when I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration.  And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave.  The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it.

I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this.  I have absolute confidence she’ll get the job done.  (Applause.)

Now, look, if you don’t like my plan, let’s at least pass what we all agree on.  Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for DREAMers — the young people who have only known America as their home.  (Applause.) 

And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster.  (Applause.)

As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables.  (Applause.) 

Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history.  The country supports immigration reform.  We should act.  Let’s argue over it, let’s debate it, but let’s act.  (Applause.)

And if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote.  Most people — (applause).  

More people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever.  It should be celebrated.  Instead, it’s being attacked.

Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away.  (Applause.)  The country supports it.  The Congress should act now.  (Applause.)

Look, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.

Lives were put at risk — many of your lives.  Lives were lost.  Extraordinary courage was summoned.  The insurrection was an existential crisis –- a test of whether our democracy could survive.  And it did.

But the struggle is far from over.  The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic — still vital today. 

Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?

Can our democracy deliver the most — to the most pressing needs of our people? 

Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart?

America’s adversaries –- the autocrats of the world –- are betting we can’t.  And I promise you, they’re betting we can’t.  They believe we’re too full of anger and division and rage.

They look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy.  But they are wrong.  You know it; I know it.  But we have to prove them wrong.

We have to prove democracy still works — that our government still works and we can deliver for our people.

In our first 100 days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in democracy to deliver.  We’re vaccinating the nation.  We’re creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs.  We’re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.

Opening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice — that’s the essence of America.  That’s democracy in action.

Our Constitution opens with the words — as trite as it sounds — “We the People”.  Well, it’s time to remember that “We the People” are the government — you and I.  Not some force in a distant capital.  Not some powerful force that we have no control over.  It’s us.  It’s “We the People.”

In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, “In America, we do our part.”  We all do our part.  That’s all I’m asking: that we do our part, all of us.

If we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong.  Autocrats will not win the future.  We will.  America will.  And the future belongs to America.

As I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America — not because I’m President, because what’s happening with the American people.

We have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and “We the People” did not flinch.

At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together.  We united.

With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one nation, and one America.

Folks, as I told every world leader I’ve ever met with over the years, it’s never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn’t.  (Applause.)

We are the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There is not a single thing — nothing — nothing beyond our capacity.  We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together.  (Applause.)  So let’s begin to get together.  (Applause.)

God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you for your patience.  (Applause.)"
2,Joseph Biden,2022,2021-2024,Democratic,speech,"The President. Thank you all very, very much. Thank you, please. Thank you so much. Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, and our First Lady and Second Gentleman, Members of Congress and the Cabinet, Justices of the Supreme Court, my fellow Americans: Last year, COVID-19 kept us apart. This year, we're finally together again.

Tonight we meet as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, but most importantly, as Americans with a duty to one another, to America, to the American people, and to the Constitution, and an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.

Six—[applause]—thank you. Six days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelenskiy, their—to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination literally inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees, to teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. And in this struggle—President Zelenskiy said in his speech to the European Parliament, ""Light will win over darkness.""

The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight sitting with the First Lady. Let each of us, if you're able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world and Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. She's bright, she's strong, and she's resolved. Yes. We, the United States of America, stand with the Ukrainian people.

Throughout our history, we've learned this lesson: When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos; they keep moving; and the costs, the threats to the America—and America, to the world keeps rising. That's why the NATO alliance was created: to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War II. The United States is a member, along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin's latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated—repeated—efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn't respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this Chamber, in this Nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well.

But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united. And that's what we did: We stayed united. We prepared extensively and carefully. We spent months building coalitions of other freedom-loving nations in Europe and the Americas to—from America to the Asian and African continents to confront Putin.

Like many of you, I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsify and justify his aggression. We countered Russia's lies with the truth. And now—now that he's acted, the free world is holding him accountable, along with 27 members of the European Union—including France, Germany, Italy—as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others—even Switzerland—are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.

Together, along with our allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We're cutting off Russia's largest banks from the international financial system; preventing Russia's Central Bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin's $630 billion war fund worthless. We're choking Russia's access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.

Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: No more. The United States—[applause]—I mean it. The United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs.

We're joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We're coming for your ill-begotten gains. And tonight I'm announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy.

He has no idea what's coming. The ruble has already lost 30 percent of its value, the Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is the one to blame.

Together with our allies, we're providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom: military assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. We're giving more than a billion dollars in direct assistance to Ukraine. And we'll continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.

But let me be clear: Our Forces are not engaged and will not engage in the conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our Forces are not going to Europe to fight [in]* Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. For that purpose, we have mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments to protect NATO countries, including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. And as I've made crystal clear, the United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power—every single inch.

And we're clear eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks, and months will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he'll pay a continuing high price over the long run. And a pound of Ukrainian people—the proud, proud people—pound for pound, ready to fight with every inch of energy they have. They've known 30 years of independence—have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.

To all Americans, I'll be honest with you, as I've always promised I would be. A Russian dictator invading a foreign country has costs around the world. And I'm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russian economy and that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight I can announce the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels of our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, united with our allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. But I know news about what's happening can seem alarming to all Americans. But I want you to know: We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay.

When the history of this era is written, Putin's war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

While it shouldn't have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what's at stake, now everyone sees it clearly. We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe, a more unified West. We see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

In the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. This is the real test, and it's going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forged a deep bond that connects our two nations: We stand with you. We stand with you. Putin may circle Kiev with tanks, but he'll never gain the hearts and souls of the Uranian [Ukrainian]* people. He'll never extinguish their love of freedom. And he will never, never weaken the resolve of the free world.

We meet tonight in an America that has lived through 2 of the hardest years this Nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.

I understand, like many of you did. My dad had to leave his home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to find work. So, like many of you, I grew up in a family when the price of food went up, it was felt throughout the family; it had an impact. That's why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan, because people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did.

Few pieces of legislation have done more at a critical moment in our history to lift us out of a crisis. It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the Nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief to tens of millions of Americans. It helped put food on the table. Remember those long lines of cars waiting for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk? It cut the cost of health care insurance. And as my dad used to say, it gave the people ""just a little bit of breathing room.""

And unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefited the top 1 percent of Americans, the American Rescue Plan——

Audience members. Boo!

The President. ——the American Rescue Plan helped working people and left no one behind. And, folks—and it worked. It worked. It worked and created jobs, lots of jobs. In fact, our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs in 1 year than ever before in the history of the United States of America. The economy grew at a rate of 5.7 last year, the strongest growth rate in 40 years and the first step in bringing fundamental change to our economy that hasn't worked for working people in this Nation for too long.

For the past 40 years, we were told that tax breaks for those at the top and benefits would trickle down and everyone would benefit. But that trickle-down theory led to a weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and a widening gap between the top and everyone else in the—in nearly a century.

Look, Vice President Harris and I ran for office—and I realize we have fundamental disagreements on this—but ran for office with a new economic vision for America: invest in America; educate Americans; grow the workforce; build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because we know—because we know—when the middle class grows, the poor go way up, and the wealthy do very well.

America used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. And now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. We won't be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st century if we don't fix it. That's why it was so important to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law. And I thank my Republican friends who joined to invest and rebuild America, the single biggest investment in history.

It was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We're done talking about infrastructure weeks. We're now talking about an infrastructure decade. And look, it's going to transform America to put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st century that we face with the rest of the world, particularly China. I've told Xi Jinping: It's never been a good bet to bet against the American people.

We'll create good jobs for millions of Americans—modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways—all across America. And we'll do it to withstand the devastating effects of climate crisis and promote environmental justice. We'll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations; begin to replace the poisonous lead pipes so every child, every American has clean water to drink at home and at school.

We're going to provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—rural, suburban, urban, and Tribal communities. Four thousand projects have already been announced. Many of you have announced them in your districts. And tonight I'm announcing that, this year, we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. And, folks, when we use taxpayers' dollars to rebuild America, we're going to do it by buying American. Buy American products. Support American jobs.

The Federal Government spends about $600 billion a year to keep this country safe and secure. There's been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers' dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every administration—Democrat and Republican—says they'll do it, but we're actually doing it. We'll buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails is made in America from beginning to end. All of it. All of it.

But, folks, to compete for the jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. That's why it's so important to pass the bipartisan innovation act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. We used to invest almost 2 percent of our GDP in research and development. We don't now. Can't—China is.

Let me give you one example why it's so important to pass. If you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you'll find a thousand empty acres of land. It won't look like much. But if you stop and look closely, you'll see a ""field of dreams,"" the ground on which America's future will be built. That's where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor ""mega site,"" up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. Ten thousand new jobs. And in those factories, the average job—about $135—$135,000 a year.

Some of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and everyday lives, from smartphones, technology that—the internet—technology that's yet to be invented. But that's just the beginning.

Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight—and I don't know where Pat is. Pat? There you go, Pat. Stand up. Pat came to see me, and he told me they're ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion. That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they're waiting for is for you to pass this bill. So let's not wait any longer. Send it to my desk, I'll sign it, and we will really take off in a big way.

And, folks, Intel is not alone. There's something happening in America. Just look around, and you'll see an amazing story—the rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products ""Made in America,"" the revitalization of American manufacturing. Companies are choosing to build new factories here when just a few years ago, they would have gone overseas. That's what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion in electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. GM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. All told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were created in America last year alone.

And, folks, powered by people I've met—like JoJo Burgess from generations of union steelworkers in Pittsburgh, who's here with us tonight. Where are you, JoJo? There you go. Thanks, buddy. As Ohio—as Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says—[applause]—as Sherrod Brown says, ""It's time to bury the label 'Rust Belt.'"" It's time to see the—what used to be called the Rust Belt become the home of a significant resurgence of manufacturing.

And with all the bright spots in our economy—record job growth, higher wages—too many families are struggling to keep up with their bills. Inflation is robbing them of gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel. I get it. That's why my top priority is getting prices under control.

Look, our economy roared back faster than almost anyone predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough people because of the pandemic to keep up production in their factories. So you didn't have people making those beams that went into buildings because they were out—the factory was closed. The panic [pandemic]* also disrupted the global supply chain. Factories close. When that happens, it takes longer to make goods and get them to the warehouses, to the stores, and go—prices go up.

Look at cars last year. One-third of all the inflation was because of automobile sales. There weren't enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. And guess what? Prices of automobiles went way up, especially used vehicles as well. What—and so we have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I think I have a better idea to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages.

And, folks, that means make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure and innovation in America, more goods moving faster and cheaper in America, more jobs where you can earn a good living in America. Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let's make it in America.

Look, economists——

Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

The President. Economists——

Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

The President. ——call this increasing the productive capacity of our economy. I call it building a better America. My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. Seventeen Nobel laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and, I believe, most Americans support the plan.

And here's the plan. First, cut the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for the same drug produced by the same company in America than any other country in the world. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy, the handsome young man standing up there, Joshua Davis. He and his dad both have type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every single day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make. That's what it costs the pharmaceutical company. But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times that amount.

I spoke with Joshua's mom. Imagine what it's like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God's name you're going to be able to pay for it—what it does to your family, but what it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect yourself to be. I really mean it. Think about that. That's what I think about. You know, yesterday—Joshua is here tonight, but yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy, by the way.

For Joshua and 200,000 other young people with type 1 diabetes, let's cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it. And drug companies will do very, very well—their profit margin. And while we're at it—I know we have great disagreements on this floor with this—let's let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They already set the price for VA drugs. Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans to save them $2,400 a year on their health premiums. Let's close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.

And second, let's cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combating climate change. Let's provide an investment and tax credit to weatherize your home and your business to be energy efficient and get a tax credit for it; double America's clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving another $80 a month that you've not going to have to pay at the pump.

Folks—third—the third thing we can do to change the standard of living for hard-working folks is cut the cost of childcare. [Applause] Cut the cost of childcare. Folks, if you live in a major city in America, you can pay up to $14,000 a year for childcare per child. I was a single dad for 5 years, raising two kids. I had a lot of help though. I had a mom, a dad, a brother, and sister that really helped. But middle class and working folks shouldn't have to pay more than 7 percent of their income to care for their young children.

My plan would cut the cost of childcare in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn't afford childcare to be able to get back to work, generating economic growth. But my plan doesn't stop there. It also includes home and long-term care, more affordable housing, pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. All of these will lower costs to families.

And under my plan, nobody—let me say this again—nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Not a single penny. I may be wrong, but my guess is, if we took a secret ballot in this floor, that we'd all agree that the present tax system ain't fair. We have to fix it. I'm not looking to punish anybody, but let's make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share.

Look, last year—[applause]—last year—and like Chris Coons and Tom Carper and my distinguished Congresswoman—we come from the land of corporate America. There are more corporations incorporated in America [Delaware]* than every other State in America combined. And I still won 36 years in a row. The point is, even they understand they should pay just a fair share.

Last year, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies earned $40 billion in profit and paid zero in Federal taxes.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. No, look, it's not fair. That's why I proposed a 15-percent minimum tax rate for corporations. And we've got—and that's why in the G-7 and other meetings overseas we were able to put together—I was able to be somewhat helpful—130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can't get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. It will raise billions of dollars.

And that's why I've proposed closing loopholes for the very wealthy who don't pay—who pay a lower tax rate than a teacher and a firefighter. So that's my plan. But we have—we'll go into more detail later. I'm going to grow—we will grow the economy, lower the costs to families. So what are we waiting for? Let's get this done. We all know we've got to make changes.

Folks, and while you're at it, confirm my nominees for the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.

My plan will not only lower costs and give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. The previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs—the job of those to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. Remember we had those debates about whether or not those watchdogs should be able to see, every day, how much money was being spent, where it—was it going to the right place?

In my administration, the watchdogs are back. And we're going after the criminals who stole billions of relief money meant for small business and millions of Americans. And tonight I'm announcing that the Justice Department will soon name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.

And look—[applause]—I think we all agree—thank you—by the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office, the only President ever to cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion in a single year.

Lowering your costs also meant demanding more competition. I'm a capitalist, but capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation. It drives up profits [prices].* When corporations have to compete, their profits go up and your prices go up—when they don't have to compete. Small businesses and family farmers and ranchers—I need not tell some of my Republican friends from those States—guess what? You've got four basic meatpacking facilities. That's it. You play with them or you don't get to play at all. And you pay a hell of a lot more—a hell of a lot more—because there's only four.

See what's happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, about half a dozen or less foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000 percent and made record profits. Tonight I'm announcing a crackdown on those companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.

Folks—[applause]—and as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down, and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch. Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they inspect and they will—looked at closely. We're also going to cut costs to keep the economy going strong and giving workers a fair shot; provide more training and apprenticeships; hire them based on skills, not just their degrees.

Let's pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; and extend the child tax credit so no one has to raise a family in poverty. Let's increase Pell grants; increase our historic support for HBCUs; and invest in what Jill, our First Lady, who teaches full time, calls America's best kept secret: community colleges.

Look, let's pass the PRO Act. When a majority of workers want to form a union, they shouldn't be able to be stopped. When we invest in our workers and we build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, together we can do something we haven't done in a long time: build a better America.

For more than 2 years, COVID has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of this Nation. And I know you're tired, frustrated, and exhausted. That doesn't even count the close to a million people who sit at a dining room table or a kitchen table and look at an empty chair because they lost somebody.

But I also know this: Because of the progress we've made, because of your resilience and the tools that we have been provided by this Congress, tonight I can say we're moving forward safely, back to a more—normal routines. We've reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19 where severe cases are down to a level not seen since July of last year.

Just a few days ago, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new mask guidelines. Under the new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now go mask free. And based on projections, more of the country will reach a point across—that point across the next couple of weeks. And thanks to the progress we've made in the past year, COVID-19 no longer need control our lives. I know some are talking about ""living with COVID-19."" But tonight I say that we never will just accept living with COVID-19; we'll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases.

And because this virus mutates and spreads, we have to stay on guard. And here are four commonsense steps as we move forward safely, in my view: first, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you're vaccinated and boosted, you have the highest degree of protection, and we'll never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see their vaccines authorized for their children. Scientists are working hard to get that done, and we'll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do.

We're already—we are also ready with antiviral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90 percent. I've ordered more pills than anyone in the world has. Pfizer is working overtime to get us a million pills this month and more than double that next month. And now we're launching the ""Test To Treat"" initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy and, if they prove positive, receive the antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.

And, folks, if you're immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. We're leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone's needs as we move forward. On testing, we've made hundreds of millions of tests available, and you can order them for free to your doorstep. And we've already ordered free tests. If you already ordered free tests, tonight I'm announcing you can order another group of tests. COVID—go to COVIDtests.gov, starting next week, and you can get more tests.

Second, we must prepare for new variants. Over the past—we've gotten much better at detecting new variants. If necessary, we'll be able to develop [deploy]* new vaccines within a hundred days instead of maybe months or years. And if Congress presides [provides]* the funds we need, we'll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed. I can't promise a new variant won't come, but I can promise you we'll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.

Third, we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. It's time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again with people. People working from home can feel safe and begin to return to their offices.

We're doing that here in the Federal Government. The vast majority of Federal workers will once again work in person. Our schools are open. Let's keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. With 75 percent of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77 percent, most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and move forward safely.

We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. Of course, continuing this costs money, so it will not surprise you I'll be back to see you all. [Laughter] And I'm going to soon send a request to Congress. The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want again—we may need them again. So I expect Congress—and I hope you'll pass that quickly.

Fourth, we'll continue vaccinating the world. We've sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries—more than any nation on Earth. We won't stop, because you can't build a wall high enough to keep out a vaccine—the vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.

You know, we've lost so much in COVID-19. Time with one another. The worst of all, the loss of life. Let's use this moment to reset. So stop looking at COVID as a partisan dividing line. See it for what it is, a God-awful disease. Let's stop sending—seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we are, fellow Americans.

Look, we can't change how divided we've been. That was a long time in coming. But we can change how to move forward on COVID-19 and other issues that we must face together.

I recently visited New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They were responding to a 911 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22 years old. Both Dominican Americans who grew up in the same streets that they later chose to parole—to patrol as police officers. I spoke with their families, and I told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifices and we'll carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety in every community it deserves.

Like some of you that have been around for a while—I've worked with you on these issues for a long time. I know what works: Investigating [Investing in]* crime prevention and community policing: cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.

Let's not abandon our streets or choose between safety and equal justice. Let's come together and protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. That's why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.

That's why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion that cities, States, and counties can use to hire more police, invest in more proven strategies like community violence interruption, trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people some hope. We should all agree the answer is not to defund the police.

Audience member. That's right!

The Presiden"
3,Joseph Biden,2023,2021-2024,Democratic,speech,"Mr. Speaker——

[At this point, the President turned to face audience members.]

Thank you. You can smile. It's okay.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Please.

Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman—good to see you guys up there—[applause]—Members of Congress. and by the way, Chief Justice, I may need a court order. She gets to go to the game tomorrow—next week. I have to stay home. [Laughter] We've got to work something out here.

Members of the Cabinet, leaders of our military, Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court, and to you, my fellow Americans: You know, I start tonight by congratulating the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. Speaker, I don't want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you. [Laughter]

And I want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats, the first African American minority leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries. He won in spite of the fact I campaigned for him. [Laughter]

Congratulations to the longest serving leader in the history of the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell. Where are you, Mitch?

And congratulations to Chuck Schumer, another—you know, another term as Senate minority [majority; White House correction] leader. You know, I think you—only this time you have a slightly bigger majority, Mr. Leader. And you're the majority leader. About that much bigger? [Laughter] Yes.

Well, I tell you what, I want to give special recognition to someone who I think is going to be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of the House of Representatives: Nancy Pelosi.

Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience, of always moving forward, of never, ever giving up. It's a story unique among all nations. We're the only country that has emerged from every crisis we've ever entered stronger than we got into it. Look, folks, that's what we're doing again.

Two years ago, the economy was reeling. I stand here tonight, after we've created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs—more jobs created in 2 years than any President has created in 4 years—because of you all, because of the American people.

Two years ago—[applause]. And 2 years ago, COVID had shut down—our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much. And today, COVID no longer controls our lives.

And 2 years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. And today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.

As we gather here tonight, we're writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America—and they do, believe it or not—I say I can define it in one word, and I mean this: possibilities. We don't think anything is beyond our capacity. Everything is a possibility.

You know, we're often told that Democrats and Republicans can't work together. But over the past 2 years, we've proved the cynics and naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats went alone.

But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together. Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe. You came together to pass one-in-a-generation—once-in-a-generation infrastructure law building bridges connecting our Nation and our people. We came together to pass one the most significant law ever helping victims exposed to toxic burn pits. And, in fact—[applause]. It's important.

And, in fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming President, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act to the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.

And to my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there's no reason we can't work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well.

I think—folks, you all are as informed as I am, but I think the people sent us a clear message: Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhere.

That's always been my vision of our country, and I know it's many of yours: to restore the soul of this Nation; to rebuild the backbone of America, America's middle class; and to unite the country. We've been sent here to finish the job, in my view.

For decades, the middle class has been hollowed out in more than—and not in one administration, but for a long time. Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be. And along the way, something else we lost: pride, our sense of self-worth.

I ran for President to fundamentally change things. To make sure our economy works for everyone so we can all feel that pride in what we do. To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.

I know a lot of you always kid me for always quoting my dad. But my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck."" Because he really would say this. ""It's about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it.""

Well, folks, so let's look at the results. We're not finished yet, by any stretch of the imagination. But unemployment rate is at 3.4 percent, a 50-year low. And near record—and near record unemployment—near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.

We've already created, with your help, 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years. And where is it written—where is it written that America can't lead the world in manufacturing? And I don't know where that's written.

For too many decades, we imported projects and exported jobs. Now, thanks to what you've all done, we're exporting American products and creating American jobs.

Folks, inflation—inflation has been a global problem because the pandemic disrupted our supply chains, and Putin's unfair and brutal war in Ukraine disrupted energy supplies as well as food supplies, blocking all that grain in Ukraine. But we're better positioned than any country on Earth right now. But we have more to do.

But here at home, inflation is coming down. Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 from their peak. Food inflation is coming down, not fast enough, but coming down. Inflation has fallen every month for the last 6 months, while take-home pay has gone up.

Additionally, over the last 2 years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start new businesses. Ten million. And by the way, every time—every time someone starts a small business, it's an act of hope.

And, Madam Vice President, I want to thank you for leading that effort to ensure that small businesses have access to capital and the historic laws we enacted that are going to just come into being.

Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibilities. Semiconductors—small computer chips the size of a fingerprint that power everything from cellphones to automobiles and so much more—these chips were invented in America. Let's get that straight: They were invented in America.

And we used to make 40 percent of the world's chips. In the last several decades, we lost our edge. We're down to only producing 10 percent.

We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories shut down overseas. Today's automobiles need 3,000 chips—each of those automobiles—but American automobiles [automakers; White House correction] couldn't make enough cars because there weren't enough chips. Car prices went up. People got laid off. So did everything from refrigerators to cell phones.

We can never let that happen again. That's why—that's why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.

Folks, I know I've been criticized for saying this, but I'm not changing my view. We're going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America—the supply chain begins in America.

And we've already created—[applause]. We've already created 800,000 new manufacturing jobs without this law, before the law kicks in. With this new law, we're going to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country. And I mean all across the country, throughout—not just the coast, but through the middle of the country as well.

That's going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investment in American manufacturing over the next few years. Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres, literally a ""field of dreams."" It's going to create 10,000 jobs, that one investment; 7,000 construction jobs; 3,000 jobs in those factories once they're finished. They call them factors. Jobs paying an average of $130,000 a year, and many do not require a college degree.

And jobs—because we worked together, these jobs where people don't have to leave home to search for opportunity. And it's just getting started. Think about the new homes, the small businesses, the big—the medium-sized businesses. So much more that's going to be needed to support those 3,000 permanent jobs and the factories that are going to be built.

Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they'll tell you what this means for their communities. We're seeing these ""fields of dreams"" transform the Heartland. But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world.

And, folks, as you all know, we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We've sunk to 13th in the world. The United States of America—13th in the world in infrastructure, modern infrastructure.

But now we're coming back because we came together and passed the bipartisan infrastructure law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System.

And, folks, already, we've funded over 20,000 projects, including major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland, projects that are going to put thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, our bridges, our railroads, our tunnels, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet all across America: urban, rural, Tribal.

And, folks, we're just getting started. We're just getting started.

And I mean this sincerely: I want to thank my Republican friends who voted for the law. And my Republican friends who voted against it as well—but I'm still—I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well, but don't worry. [Laughter] I promised I'd be a President for all Americans. We'll fund these projects. And I'll see you at the groundbreaking.

Look, this law—this law will further unite all of America. Projects like Brent Spence Bridge in Kentucky over the Ohio River, built 60 years ago, badly in need of repairs. One of the Nation's most congested freight routes, carrying $2 billion worth of freight every single day across the Ohio River.

And, folks, we've been talking about fixing it for decades, but we're really finally going to get it done. I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans in—from both States—to deliver a commitment of $1.6 billion for this project. And while I was there, I met a young woman named Saria, who's here tonight. I don't know where Saria is. Is she up in the box? I don't know. Saria, how are you?

Well, Saria—for 30 years—for 30 years—I learned—she told me she'd been a proud member of the Ironworkers Local 44, known as—known as the ""Cowboys in the Sky""—the folks who built Cincinnati's skyline. Saria said she can't wait to be 10 stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. God bless her. [Laughter] That's pride. And that's what we're also building: We're building back pride.

Look, we're also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes in America, 400,000 schools and childcare centers so every child in America—every child in American—can drink the water, instead of having permanent damage to their brain.

Look, we're making sure—[applause]—we're making sure that every community—every community in America—has access to affordable, high-speed internet. No parent should have to drive by a McDonald's parking lot to help their—do their homework online with their kids, which many—thousands were doing across the country.

And when we do these projects—and, again, I get criticized about this, but I make no excuses for it—we're going to buy American. We're going to buy American.

Folks—[applause]—and it's totally—it's totally—consistent with international trade rules. Buy American has been the law since 1933. But for too long, past administrations—Democrat and Republican—have fought to get around it. Not anymore.

Tonight I'm announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in Federal infrastructure projects to be made in America. Made in America. I mean it. Lumber, glass, drywall, fiber-optic cable. And on my watch, American roads, bridges, and American highways are going to be made with American products as well.

Folks, my economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. So many of you listening tonight, I know you feel it. So many of you felt like you've just simply been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind and treated like they're invisible.

Maybe that's you, watching from home. You remember the jobs that went away. You remember them, don't you? The folks at home remember them. You wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away.

Well, that's why—I get that. That's why we're building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of choices we made in the last several years. You know, this is, in my view, a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives at home.

For example, too many of you lay in bed at night, like my dad did, staring at the ceiling, wondering what in God's name happens if your spouse gets cancer or your child gets deadly ill or if something happens to you. What are you going—are you going to have the money to pay for those medical bills? Are you going to have to sell the house or try to get a second mortgage on it?

I get it. I get it.

With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we're taking on powerful interests to bring health care costs down so you can sleep better at night with more security. You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any nation in the world. Let me say it again: We pay more for prescription drugs than any major nation on Earth.

For example, 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes. Many of you in this chamber do and in the audience. But every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can literally stay alive. Insulin has been around for over 100 years. The guy who invented it didn't even patent it because he wanted it to be available for everyone.

It costs the drug companies roughly $10 a vial to make that insulin. Package it and all, you may get up to $13. But Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars, $4- to $500 a month, making record profits. Not anymore. Not anymore.

Audience members. Not anymore! Not anymore! Not anymore!

The President. So many things that we did are only now coming to fruition. We said we were doing this, and we said we'd pass the law to do it, but people didn't know because the law didn't take effect until January 1 of this year.

We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. But people are just finding out. I'm sure you're getting the same calls I'm getting.

Look, there are millions of other Americans who do not—are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with type 1 diabetes who need these insulin—need this insulin to stay alive. Let's finish the job this time. Let's cap the cost of insulin for everybody at $35.

Folks—and Big Pharma is still going to do very well, I promise you all. [Laughter] I promise you they're going to do very well.

This law also—this law also caps—and it won't even go into effect until 2025. It costs [caps; White House correction] out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum of $2,000 a year. You don't have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter how much your drug costs are. Because you know why? You all know it.

Many of you, like many of my family, have cancer. You know the drugs can range from $10-, $11-, $14-, $15,000 for the cancer drugs. And if drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies are going to have to pay Medicare back the difference.

And we're finally—we're finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down—bringing down prescription drug costs doesn't just save seniors money, it cuts the Federal deficit by billions of dollars—[applause]—by hundreds of billions of dollars because these prescription drugs are drugs purchased by Medicare to make—keep their commitment to the seniors.

Well, guess what? Instead of paying 4- or 500 bucks a month, you're paying 15. That's a lot of savings for the Federal Government. And by the way, why wouldn't we want that?

Now, some Members here are threatening—and I know it's not an official party position, so I'm not going to exaggerate—but threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. As my coach—that's okay. That's fair. As my football coach used to say, ""Lots of luck in your senior year."" [Laughter]

Make no mistake, if you try anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.

And look, I'm pleased to say that more Americans health—have health insurance now than ever in history. A record 16 million people are enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. And thanks to the law I signed last year, saving—millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.

And by the way, that law was written—and the benefit expires in 2025. So my plea to some of you, at least in this audience: Let's finish the job and make these savings permanent. Expand coverage on Medicaid.

Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever in climate change—ever. Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, leading the world to a clean energy future.

I visited the devastating aftermath of record floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires from Arizona to New Mexico to all the way up to the Canadian border. More timber has been burned that I've observed from helicopters than the entire State of Missouri. And we don't have global warming? Not a problem.

In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we're rebuilding for the long term. New electric grids that are able to weather major storms and not—prevent those fire—forest fires. Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood. Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities often left behind.

We're going to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers. And we're helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits to purchase electric vehicles and efficient—and efficient appliances—energy-efficient appliances. Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our land.

Let's face reality. The climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or a blue State. It's an existential threat. We have an obligation not to ourselves, but to our children and our grandchildren to confront it.

I'm proud of how the—how America, at last, is stepping up to the challenge. We're still going to need oil and gas for a while, but guess what—[applause]—no, we do—but there's so much more to do. We've got to finish the job.

And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Just begin.

Look, I'm a capitalist. I'm a capitalist. But pay your fair share. I think a lot of you at home—a lot of you at home—agree with me and many people that you know: The tax system is not fair. It is not fair.

Look, the idea that in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America, the Fortune 500, made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in Federal taxes? Zero.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. Folks, it's simply not fair.

But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. God love them. Fifteen percent. That's less than a nurse pays.

And let me be crystal clear. I said at the very beginning: Under my plans, as long as I'm President, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in taxes. Nobody. Not one penny.

But let's finish the job. There's more to do.

We have to reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for the billionaire minimum tax. You know, there's a thousand billionaires in America—it's up from about 600 at the beginning of my term—but no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher or a firefighter. No, I mean it. Think about it.

I mean, look, I know you all aren't enthusiastic about that, but think about it. Think about it. Have you noticed? Big Oil just reported its profits. Record profits. Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis. I think it's outrageous.

Why? They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production. And when I talked to a couple of them, they say, ""We were afraid you were going to shut down all the oil wells and all the oil refineries anyway, so why should we invest in them?"" I said, ""We're going to need oil for at least another decade, and that's going to exceed""—[laughter]—and beyond that. We're going to need it. Production.

If they had, in fact, invested in the production to keep gas prices down—instead they used the record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.

Corporations ought to do the right thing. That's why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They'll still make considerable profit.

Let's finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes. Instead of cutting the number of audits for wealthy taxpayers, I just signed a law to reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. That's being fiscally responsible.

In the last 2 years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history. Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up 4 years in a row.

Because of those record deficits, no President added more to the national debt in any 4 years than my predecessor. Nearly 25 percent of the entire national debt that took over 200 years to accumulate was added by just one administration alone, the last one. They're the facts. Check it out. Check it out.

How did Congress respond to that debt? They did the right thing. They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis. They paid the American bill to prevent an economic disaster to the country.

So tonight I'm asking the Congress to follow suit. Let's commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.

So my—many of—some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage—I get it—unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are. Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset. I'm not saying it's a majority——

Audience members. Boo!

The President. Let me give you——

Audience members. No!

The President. Anybody who doubts it, contact my office. I'll give you a copy. I'll give you a copy of the proposal.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Liar!

The President. That means Congress doesn't vote——

Well, I'm glad to see—no, I tell you, I enjoy conversion. [Laughter]

You know, it means if Congress doesn't keep the programs the way they are, they'd go away. Other Republicans say—I'm not saying it's a majority of you. I don't even think it's a significant——

Audience member. [Inaudible]—don't say——

The President. ——but it's being proposed by individuals.

Audience member. But you don't say who.

The President. I'm not—politely not naming them, but it's being proposed by some of you.

Audience members. [Inaudible]

Rep. Greene. Liar, liar!

The President. Look, folks, the idea is that we're not going to be—we're not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don't respond.

Folks—[applause]—so, folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right? They're not to be touched? [Applause] All right. All right. We've got unanimity!

Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors. Americans have to pay into them from the very first paycheck they've started. So tonight let's all agree—and we apparently are—let's stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.

Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned it. And if anyone tries to cut Social Security—which apparently no one is going to do—[laughter]—and if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I'll stop them. I'll veto it.

And look, I'm not going to allow them to take away—be taken away. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. But apparently, it's not going to be a problem. [Laughter]

Next month, when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to lay down their plan as well. I really mean it. Let's sit down together and discuss our mutual plans together. Let's do that.

I can tell you, the plan I'm going to show you is going to cut the deficit by another $2 trillion. And it won't cut a single bit of Medicare or Social Security. In fact, we're going to extend the Medicare Trust Fund at least two decades, because that's going to be the next argument: how do we make—keep it solvent. Right?

Well, I will not raise taxes on anyone making under 400 grand. But we'll pay for it the way we talked about tonight: by making sure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. Look—look, look, here's the deal. They aren't just taking advantage of the Tax Code, they're taking advantage of you, the American consumer.

Here's my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We're already preventing Americans who are [from; White House correction] receiving surprise medical bills, stopping 1 billion dollar surprise bills [1 million surprise bills; White House correction] per month so far.

We're protecting seniors' life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs that are not needed. Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get a hearing aid over the counter without a prescription.

Look, capitalism without competition is not capitalism, it's extortion; it's exploitation.

Last year, I cracked down, with the help of many of you, on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for every good coming into the country. I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90 percent, helping American farmers, businessmen, and consumers.

Let's finish the job. Pass the bipartisan legislation to strengthen and—to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.

My administration is also taking on junk fees, those hidden surcharges too many companies use to make you pay more. For example, we're making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront, refund your money if your flight is canceled or delayed. We've reduced exorbitant bank overdrafts by saving consumers more than $1 billion a year. We're cutting credit card late fees by 75 percent, from $30 to $8.

Look, junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most other folks in homes like the one I grew up in, like many of you did. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month. They make it harder for you to pay your bills or afford that family trip.

I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it. Not anymore. We've written a bill to stop it all. It's called the Junk Fee Prevention Act. We're going to ban surprise resort fees that hotels charge on your bill. Those fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren't even resorts. [Laughter]

We—the idea that cable, internet, and cell phone companies can charge you $200 or more if you decide to switch to another provider. Give me a break. We can stop service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all the fees upfront. And we'll prohibit airlines from charging $50 roundtrip for a family just to be able to sit together. Baggage fees are bad enough. Airlines can't treat your child like a piece of baggage.

Americans are tired of being—we're tired of being played for suckers. So pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.

For too long, workers have been getting stiffed, but not anymore. We're going to be—we're beginning to restore the dignity of work.

For example, I should have known this, but I didn't until 2 years ago: Thirty million workers have to sign noncompete agreements for the jobs they take. Thirty million. So a cashier at a burger place can't walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. It just changed. Well, they just changed it because we exposed it. That was part of the deal, guys. Look it up. But not anymore. We're banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they're worth.

And I must tell you, this is bound to get a response from my friends on my left, but the right. I'm so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing. Pass the PRO Act! Because businesses have a right—workers have a right to form a union. And let's guarantee all workers have a living wage.

Let's make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, affordable childcare. That's going to enable millions of more people to go and stay at work. And let's restore the full child tax credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half to the lowest level in history.

And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity, we increase economic growth.

So let's finish the job and get more families access to affordable, quality housing.

Let's get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. Let's give more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.

Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the homecare services they need and support the workers who are doing God's work.

These plans are fully paid for, and we can afford to do them.

Restoring the dignity of work means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class. You know, when we made public education—12 years of it—universal in the last century, we made the best educated, best paid—we became the best education, best paid nation in the world.

But the rest of the world has caught up. It's caught up.

Jill, my wife, who teaches full-time, has an expression. I hope I get it right, kid. [Laughter] ""Any nation that outeducates is going to outcompete us."" Any nation that outeducates is going to outcompete us.

Folks, we all know 12 years of education is not enough to win the economic competition of the 21st century. If we want to have the best educated workforce, let's finish the job by providing access to preschool for 3 and 4 years old. Studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50-percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background they came from.

Let's give public school teachers a raise.

We're making progress by reducing student debt, increasing Pell grants for working and middle class families. Let's finish the job and connect students to career opportunities starting in high school, provide access to 2 years of community college, the best career training in Am"
4,Joseph Biden,2024,2021-2024,Democratic,speech,"The President. Your bedtime reading.

Tony! Thank you. Looking for Jill.

Good evening. Good evening. If I were smart, I'd go home now. [Laughter]

Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: In January 1941, Franklin Roosevelt came to this Chamber to speak to the Nation. And he said, ""I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union."" Hitler was on the march. War was raging in Europe. President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time. Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.

Tonight I come to the same Chamber to address the Nation. Now it's we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union. And yes, my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today.

What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack at—both at home and overseas at the very same time. Overseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you: He will not.

But Ukraine—[applause]. Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all—that is all—Ukraine is asking. They're not asking for American soldiers. In fact, there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine, and I'm determined to keep it that way.

But now assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership. It wasn't long ago when a Republican President named Ronald Reagan thundered, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" Now—[applause]. Now my predecessor, a former Republican President, tells Putin, quote, ""Do whatever the hell you want.""

Audience members. Boo!

The President. That's a quote. A former President actually said that, bowing down to a Russian leader. I think it's outrageous, it's dangerous, and it's unacceptable.

America is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of democratic nations created after World War II prevent—to prevent war and keep the peace. And today we've made NATO stronger than ever. We welcomed Finland to the alliance last year. And just this morning Sweden officially joined, and their Minister is here tonight. Come here, stand up. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. And they know how to fight.

Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen.

I say this to Congress: We have to stand up to Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill. History is literally watching. History is watching. If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk. The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm.

My message to President Putin, who I've known for a long time, is simple: We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.

In a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching, just like history watched 3 years ago on January 6, when insurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.

Many of you were here on that darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes, the insurrectionists were not patriots. They had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn the will of the people.

January 6 lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed a great—gravest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War. But they failed. America stood—[applause]. America stood strong, and democracy prevailed. We must be honest: The threat to democracy must be defended [defeated; White House correction].

My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6. I will not do that. This is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here's the simple truth: You can't love your country only when you win.

As I've done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you, without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy. Remember your oath of office to defend against all threats foreign and domestic. Respect—respect—free and fair elections, restore trust in our institutions, and make clear political violence has absolutely no place—no place—in America. Zero place.

Again, it's not hyperbole to suggest history is watching. They're watching. Your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do.

History is watching another assault on freedom. Joining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama.

Fourteen months ago—fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have that second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait.

What her family had gone through should never have happened. Unless Congress acts, it could happen again. So tonight let's stand up for families like hers. To my friends across the aisle, don't keep this waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF. Guarantee it nationwide.

Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right.

I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader defending reproductive freedom and so much more. [Applause] Thank you.

My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned, and he brags about it. Look at the chaos that has resulted.

Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas. She'd become pregnant again and had a fetus with a fatal condition. Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have future in the—children in the future were at risk if she didn't act. Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the State to get what she needed.

What her family had gone through should have never happened as well. But it's happening to too many others. There are State laws banning the freedom to choose, criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their States to get the treatment they need.

Many of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. My God, what freedom else would you take away?

Look, its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote the following—and with all due respect, Justices—""Women are not without electoral power""—excuse me—""electoral or political power."" You're about to realize just how much you were right about that.

Clearly—[applause]. Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women. But they found out. When reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2023. And we'll win again in 2024.

If you—if you, the American people—send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.

Folks, America cannot go back.

I am here tonight to show what I believe is the way forward, because I know how far we've come. Four years ago next week, before I came to office, the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. Remember the fear, record losses?

Remember the spikes in crime and the murder rate? A raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones, millions left behind. A mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness.

A President, my predecessor, failed in the most basic Presidential duty that he owes to American people: the duty to care.

Representative Derrick Van Orden. Lies!

The President. I think that's unforgivable.

I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the Nation's history. We have. It doesn't make new, but in a—news—in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.

So let's tell the story here—tell it here and now. America's comeback is building a future of American possibilities; building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down; investing in all of America, in all Americans to make every—sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one—no one—behind.

The pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccine that saved us from COVID is—are now being used to beat cancer. Turning setback into comeback—that's what America does. That's what America does.

Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world: 15 million new jobs in just 3 years—a record, a record; unemployment at 50-year lows.

A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses, and each one is a literal act of hope, with historic job growth and small-business growth for Black and Hispanics and Asian Americans. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs in America and counting. Where is it written we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? We are, and we will.

More people have health insurance today—[applause]. More people have health insurance today than ever before. The racial wealth gap is the smallest it's been in 20 years. Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent, the lowest in the world and tending [trending; White House correction] lower.

The landing is and will be soft. And now, instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we're exporting American products and creating American jobs, right here in America, where they belong.

And it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.

""Buy America"" has been the law of the land since the 1930s. Past administrations, including my predecessor—including some Democrats, as well, in the past—failed to buy American. Not anymore.

On my watch, Federal projects that you fund—like helping build American roads, bridges, and highways—will be made with American products and built by American workers, creating good-paying American jobs.

And thanks to our CHIPS and Science Act, the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to automobiles—and by the way, we invented those chips right here in America.

Well, instead of having to import them, instead of—private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America, creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don't require a college degree.

In fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America. And thanks—[applause]. And thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure law, 46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities.

And by the way, I noticed some of you who've strongly voted against it are there cheering on that money coming in. [Laughter] And I like it. I'm with you. I'm with you. And if any of you don't want that money in your district, just let me know. [Laughter]

Modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, public transit systems; removing poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of brain damage; providing affordable—affordable—high-speed internet for every American, no matter where you live—urban, suburban, or rural communities in red States and blue States; record investments in Tribal communities.

Because of my investment in family farms—[applause]—because I invested in family farms—led by my Secretary of Agriculture, who knows more about this than anybody I know—we're better able to stay in the family for the—those farms so their—and their children and grandchildren won't have to leave home to make a living. It's transformative.

The great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came to office, the plant was on its way to shutting down. Thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading.

Then, I was elected to office, and we raised the Belvidere repeatedly with auto companies, knowing unions would make all the difference. The UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get these jobs back. And together, we succeeded.

Instead of auto factories shutting down, auto factories are reopening, and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power those cars there at the same—[applause]. Folks—[applause]. To the folks of Belvidere, I say: Instead of your town being left behind, your community is moving forward again. Because instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas, 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building a future in Belvidere right here in America.

Here tonight is UAW President Shawn Fain, a great friend and a great labor leader. Shawn, where are you? Stand up. And Dawn—and Dawn Simms, a third-generation worker—UAW worker at Belvidere. Shawn, I was proud to be the first President to stand in the picket line. And today, Dawn has a good job in her hometown, providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well.

Showing once again, Wall Street didn't build America. They're not bad guys. They didn't build it, though. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.

I say to the American people: When America gets knocked down, we get back up. We keep going. That's America. That's you, the American people. It's because of you America is coming back. It's because of you our future is brighter. It's because of you that tonight we can proudly say the state of our Union is strong and getting stronger.

Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!

The President. Tonight—tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together, a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get the—all the tax breaks.

And by the way, I understand corporations. I come from a State that has more corporations invested—[laughter]—than every one of your States in the State—the United States combined. And I represented it for 36 years. I'm not anticorporation.

But I grew up in a home where trickle-down economics didn't put much on my dad's kitchen table. That's why I determined to turn things around so the middle class does well. When they do well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.

And there's more to do to make sure you're feeling the benefits of all we're doing.

Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. It's wrong, and I'm ending it. With a law that I proposed and signed—and not one of your Republican buddies work—voted for it—we finally beat Big Pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month or thereabouts for insulin with diabetes—and it only costs 10 bucks to make—they only get paid $35 a month now and still make a healthy profit.

And I want to—and what to do next, I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it—everyone.

For years, people have talked about it. But finally, we got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs, just like the VA is able to do for veterans.

That's not just saving seniors money. It's saving taxpayers money. We cut the Federal deficit by $160 billion, because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma.

This year, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. It's now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.

They're making a lot of money, guys. And they'll still be extremely profitable. It will not only save lives, it will save taxpayers another $200 billion.

Starting next year, the same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $200—at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $15,000. Now I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone.

Folks, I'm going to get in trouble for saying that, but any of you want to get in Air Force One with me and fly to Toronto, Berlin, Moscow—I mean, excuse me. [Laughter] Well, even Moscow, probably. [Laughter] And bring your prescription with you, and I promise you, I'll get it for you for 40-percent the cost you're paying now. Same company, same drug, same place.

Folks, the Affordable Care Act—the old ""Obamacare""—is still a very big deal. [Laughter] Over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition. But my predecessor and many in this Chamber want to take the—that prescription drug away by repealing Affordable Care Act.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. I'm not going to let that happen. We stopped you 50 times before, and we'll stop you again.

In fact, I'm not only protecting it, I'm expanding it. The—we enacted tax credits of $800 per person per year [to; White House correction] reduce health care costs for millions of working families. That tax credit expires next year. I want to make that savings permanent.

To state the obvious: Women are more than half of our population, but research on women's health has always been underfunded. That's why we're launching the first ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, led by Jill—doing an incredible job as First Lady—to pass my plan for $12 billion to transform women's health research and benefit millions of lives all across America.

I know the cost of housing is so important to you. If inflation keeps coming down, mortgage rates will come down as well, and the Fed acknowledges that.

But I'm not waiting. I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next 2 years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. Just for 2 years.

And my administration is also eliminating title insurance [fees; White House correction] on federally backed mortgages. When you refinance your home, you can save $1,000 or more as a consequence.

For millions of renters, we're cracking down on big landlords who use antitrust law—using antitrust—who break antitrust laws—by price-fixing and driving up rents. We've cut redtape so builders can get federally financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million new house—housing units nationwide.

Now pass—[applause]—now pass [my plan; White House correction] and build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those rents down.

To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world. And I, like I suspect all of you, want to give a child—every child a good start by providing access to preschool for 3- and 4-years-old.

You know, I think I pointed out last year—[applause]. I think I pointed out last year that children coming from broken homes where there's no books, they're not read to, not spoken to very often start school—kindergarten or first grade hearing—having heard a million fewer words spoken.

Well, studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50-percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- and 4-year degree no matter what their background is.

I met a year and a half ago with the leaders of the Business Roundtable. They were mad that I was ever—angry—I—well, they were discussing—[laughter]—why I wanted to spend money on education.

I pointed out to them: As Vice President, I met with over eight—I think it was 182 of those folks—don't hold me to the exact number—and I asked them what they need most—the CEOs. And you've had the same experience on both sides of the aisle. They say, ""A better educated workforce,"" right?

So I looked at them. And I say: ""I come from Delaware. DuPont used to be the eighth largest corporation in the world. And every new enterprise they bought, they educated the workforce to that enterprise. But none of you do that anymore. Why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best educated workforce in the world?""

And they all looked at me and said, ""I think you're right.""

I want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade. I'm also connecting local businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job whether or not they go to college.

And I want to make sure that college is more affordable. Let's continue increasing the Pell grants to working and middle class families and increase record investments in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions, including Hispanic institutions.

When I was told I couldn't universally just change the way in which we did—dealt with student loans, I fixed two student loan programs that already existed to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including nurses, firefighters, and others in public service.

Like Keenan Jones, a public educator in Minnesota, who's here with us tonight. Keenan, where are you? Keenan, thank you. He's educated hundreds of students so they can go to college. Now he's able to help, after debt forgiveness, get his own daughter to college.

And, folks, look, such relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home, start a business, start a family.

And while we're at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise.

And by the way, the first couple of years, we cut the deficit.

Now let me speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all Americans. I've been delivering real results in fiscally responsible ways. We've already cut the Federal deficit—[laughter]. We've already cut the Federal deficit over $1 trillion.

I signed a bipartisan deal to cut another trillion dollars in the next decade. It's my goal to cut the Federal deficit another $3 trillion by making big corporations and the very wealthy finally beginning to pay their fair share.

Look, I'm a capitalist. If you want to make or can make a million or millions of bucks, that's great. Just pay your fair share in taxes.

A fair Tax Code is how we invest in things that make this country great: health care, education, defense, and so much more.

But here's the deal. The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent—the very wealthy——

Audience members. Boo!

The President. ——and the biggest corporations—and exploded the Federal deficit.

They added more to the national debt than any Presidential term in American history. Check the numbers.

Folks at home, does anybody really think the Tax Code is fair?

Audience members. No!

The President. Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break?

Audience members. No!

The President. I sure don't. I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in Federal taxes—nobody—not one penny. And they haven't yet.

In fact, the child tax credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half. Restore that child tax credit. No child should go hungry in this country.

The way to make the Tax Code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Remember in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in Federal income tax. Zero.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. Not anymore.

Thanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. But that's still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. It's time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.

I also want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, massive executive pay when it was only supposed to be a million—a million dollars that could be deducted. They can pay them $20 million if they want, but deduct a million. End it now.

You know, there are 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what the average Federal tax is for those billionaires?

Audience member. Zero!

The President. No. [Laughter] They're making great sacrifices—8.2 percent.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. That's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower Federal tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, or a nurse.

I proposed a minimum tax for billionaires of 25 percent—just 25 percent. You know what that would raise? That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years.

And imagine what that could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable childcare, millions of families can get what they need to go to work to help grow the economy. Imagine a future with paid leave, because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of their sick family member. Imagine—imagine—a future with home care and eldercare, and people's living with disabilities so they can stay in their homes and family caregivers can finally get the pay they deserve.

Tonight let's all agree once again to stand up for seniors. Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle want to put Social Security on the chopping block. If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop you.

The working people—[applause]. The working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. It's not fair.

We have two ways to go. Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy. I will——

Audience member. [Inaudible]

The President. That's the proposal. Oh, no? You guys don't want another $2 trillion tax cut?

Audience member. Liar!

The President. I kind of thought that's what your plan was. [Laughter] Well, that's good to hear. You're not going to cut another $2 trillion for the superwealthy? That's good to hear.

I'll protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share.

Look——

Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!

The President. ——too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for less and less. That's why we're cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging and deceptive pricing, from food to health care to housing.

In fact, the snack companies think you won't notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer—[laughter]—same size bag—put fewer chips in it. No, I'm not joking. It's called ""shrink-flation."" Pass Bobby Casey's bill, and stop this. I really mean it.

You probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars. [Laughter] And you get—you get charged the same amount, and you've got about, I don't know, 10-percent fewer Snickers in it. [Laughter]

Look, I'm also getting rid of junk fees, those hidden fees at the end of your bill that are there without your knowledge. My administration announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8.

Banks and credit card companies are allowed to charge what it costs them to instigate the collection. And that's more—a hell of a lot like $8 than 30-some dollars.

But they don't like it. The credit card companies don't like it, but I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I'm eliminating. Folks at home, that's why the banks are so mad. It's $20 billion in profit.

I'm not stopping there. My administration has proposed rules to make cable, travel, utilities, and online ticket sellers tell you the total price up front so there are no surprises. It matters. It matters.

And so does this. In November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators. The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. Oh, you don't think so?

Audience members. Boo!

The President. Oh, you don't like that bill—huh?—that conservatives got together and said was a good bill? I'll be darned. That's amazing.

That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years now. What are you against?

One hundred more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles smuggling fentanyl into America that's killing thousands of children.

This bill would save lives and bring order to the border. It would also give me and any new President new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming.

The Border Patrol union has endorsed this bill.

[At this point, members of the audience spoke over the President.]

The Federal Chamber of Commerce has—yes, yes. You're saying ""no."" Look at the facts. [Laughter] I know—[applause]. I know you know how to read.

I believe that given the opportunity—for—a majority in the House and Senate would endorse the bill as well—a majority right now.

Audience member. Yes!

The President. But unfortunately, politics has derailed this bill so far.

I'm told my predecessor called Members of Congress in the Senate to demand they block the bill. He feels political win—he viewed it as a—it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him. It's not about him. It's not about me. I'd be a winner—not really. I——

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. What about Laken Riley?

[Members of the audience spoke over the President.]

Audience members. Boo!

Rep. Greene. Say her name!

[The President held up a pin reading: ""Say Her Name, Laken Riley.""]

The President. Lanken—Lanken [Laken; White House correction] Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed.

Rep. Greene. By an illegal!

The President. By an illegal. That's right. But how many of thousands of people are being killed by legals?

[Members of the audience spoke over the President.]

To her parents, I say: My heart goes out to you. Having lost children myself, I understand.

But look, if we change the dynamic at the border—people pay people—people pay these smugglers 8,000 bucks to get across the border because they know if they get by—if they get by and let into the country, it's 6 to 8 years before they have a hearing. And it's worth the—taking the chance of the $8,000.

[Members of the audience spoke over the President.]

But—but—if it's only 6 months—6 weeks, the idea is it's highly unlikely that people will pay that money and come all that way knowing that they'll be—able to be kicked out quickly.

Folks, I would respectfully suggest to my friend in—my Republican friends owe it to the American people. Get this bill done. We need to act now.

Audience members. Get it done! Get it done! Get it done!

Audience member. Build the wall.

The President. And if my predecessor is watching: Instead of paying [playing; White House correction] politics and pressuring Members of Congress to block the bill, join me in telling the Congress to pass it. We can do it together. But that's what he apparently—here's what he will not do.

I will not demonize immigrants, saying they are ""poison in the blood of our country."" I will not separate families. I will not ban people because of their faith.

Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system. Take a look at it. It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for ""Dreamers,"" and so much more.

But, unlike my predecessor, I know who we are as Americans. We're the only nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new.

Home to Native Americans whose ancestors have been here for thousands of years. Home to people of every place—from every place on Earth. They came freely. Some came in chains. Some came when famine struck, like my ancestral family in Ireland. Some to flee persecution, to chase dreams that are impossible anywhere but here in America.

Tha"
5,Donald Trump,2025,2025-2028,Republican,speech,"The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you very much.

Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the First Lady of the United States, Members of the United States Congress: Thank you very much.

And to my fellow citizens, America is back.

Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

The President. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.

We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years or 8 years, and we are just getting started. [Applause] Thank you.

I return to this Chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back, our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American dream is surging bigger and better than ever before. The American dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback, the likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again. There's never been anything like it.

The Presidential election of November 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing States, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote——

Representative Alexander N. Green. [Inaudible]

The President. ——by big numbers and won counties in our country——

Audience members. Boo!

Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

Rep. Green. You are—you have no right to cut Medicaid.

Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

The President. ——and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.

Now, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact, it's an astonishing record: 27-point swing, the most ever.

Likewise, small-business optimism saw its single largest 1-month gain ever recorded——

Speaker of the House of Representatives J. Michael Johnson. Mr. President——

The President. ——a 41-point jump.

[At this point, Speaker Johnson struck the gavel.]

Speaker Johnson. Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease any further disruptions. That's your warning.

Rep. Green. He has no mandate to cut Medicaid.

Speaker Johnson. Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the Sergeant at Arms to restore order to the joint session.

Mr. Green, take your seat. Take your seat, sir.

Rep. Green. He has no mandate to cut Medicaid.

Speaker Johnson. Take your seat.

[Several Members of Congress spoke at once.]

Finding that Members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum, the chair now directs the Sergeant at Arms to restore order. Remove this gentleman from the Chamber.

Rep. Green. Shame on all of you.

[Members of Congress sang ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.""]

[Several Members of Congress spoke at once.]

You have no mandate.

Speaker Johnson. Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House.

Mr. President, you can continue.

The President. Thank you.

Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive orders and taken more than 400 executive actions—a record—to restore common sense, safety, optimism, and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I'm doing it.

In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our Presidency—it's our Presidency—is the most successful in the history of our nation—by many. And what makes it even more impressive is that—do you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? [Laughter] How about that? I don't know about that list, but we'll take it.

Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country. And what a job they've done.

As a result, illegal border crossings last month were, by far, the lowest ever recorded—ever. They heard my words, and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.

In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst President in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?

This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and, once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease—a disease that would wipe out entire nations—or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what.

Five—five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.

So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this 1 night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America? For the good of our Nation, let's work together, and let's truly make America great again.

Every day, my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs, to bring a future that America deserves, and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action.

Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all Federal hiring, a freeze on all new Federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous ""green new scam."" I withdrew from the unfair Paris climate accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization. And I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council.

We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our autoworkers and companies from economic destruction.

To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every 1 new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other President had done before.

We ordered all Federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job.

And we have ended weaponized Government, where, as an example, a sitting President is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. How did that work out? [Laughter] Not too good. Not too good.

And I have stopped all Government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It's back.

And 2 days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America. I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And, likewise, I renamed—for a great President, William McKinley—Mount McKinley again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska.

We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies all across the entire Federal Government and, indeed, the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.

We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer, or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. Very important. You should be hired based on merit. And the Supreme Court, in a brave and very powerful decision, has allowed us to do so.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools. And I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders: male and female.

I also signed an Executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports.

Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete—one of the best—preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls' volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side, and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it.

Payton is here tonight in the gallery. And, Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls' team or they will lose all Federal funding.

And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the woman's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming, or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race 5 hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by 5 hours. Broke the record by 5 hours.

It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.

What I have just described is only a small fraction of the commonsense revolution that is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world. Common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never. Never going to let that happen.

Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans. They've not—never had anything like it.

We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country—they're not sure. As President, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.

Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. The egg price is out of control, and we're working hard to get it back down.

Secretary, do a good job on that. You inherited a total mess from the previous administration. Do a good job.

A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95 percent, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now.

And frankly, we have never seen anything like it. That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth and by far. And now I've fully authorized the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.

My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska—among the largest in the world—where Japan, South Korea, and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. There's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting is gotten. And later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the U.S.A.

To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but we'll be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars. And to that end, I have created the brandnew Department of Government Efficiency—DOGE—perhaps you've heard of it—perhaps—which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight.

Thank you, Elon. He's working very hard. He didn't need this. [Laughter] He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it, I believe. They just don't want to admit that.

Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens; $45 million for diversity, equity, and inclusion scholarships in Burma; $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. [Laughter]

Eight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of—[laughter]—$60 million for Indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America, $60 million; $8 million for making mice transgender. [Laughter] This is real. Thirty-two million dollars for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova.

Ten million dollars for male circumcision in Mozambique; $20 million for the Arab ""Sesame Street"" in the Middle East—it's a program—$20 million for a program; $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee, headed up—and we know she's involved—just at the last moment, the money was passed over—by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her?

Audience members. Boo!

The President. A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring; $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia; $14 million for social cohesion in Mali; $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.

Audience members. Boo!

The President. He's a real estate developer. He's done very well. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia; $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda; $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia; $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. [Laughter] We know what we're doing. We should use it ourselves. And $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education, the most ever paid. Nothing even like it,

Under the Trump administration, all of these scams—and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them. They're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people, headed up by Elon. And we appreciate it. We've found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.

And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taken back a lot of that money. We got it just in time.

Audience members. [Inaudible]

The President. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, a Federal Government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our Nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to.

We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on. Believe it or not, Government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old.

Audience member. Lies!

Audience member. False!

Audience member. False!

The President. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly—[laughter]—3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129; 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139.

Audience member. Those are lies!

Audience member. Not true!

The President. Three-point-five million people from ages 140 to 149.

Audience member. Not true!

The President. And money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now.

In fact, Pam, good luck. Good luck. You're going to find it.

But a lot of money is paid out to people because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does—and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country.

One-point-three million people from ages 150 to 159. And over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old.

Audience members. False!

The President. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby. [Laughter]

Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229; one person between the age of 240 and 249; and one person is listed at 360 years of age——

Audience member. Joe Biden! [Laughter]

The President. ——more than 100 years—more than 100 years older than our country.

But we're going to find out where that money is going, and it's not going to be pretty.

By slashing all of the fraud, waste, and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors, and put more money in the pockets of American families.

And today interest rates took a beautiful drop—big, beautiful drop. It's about time.

And, in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the Federal budget. We're going to balance it.

With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the gold card, which goes on sale very, very soon.

For $5 million, we will allow the most successful, job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. [Laughter] And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came. The money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs.

They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school, as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.

So, while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers, and child predators who were allowed to enter our country under the open-border policy of these people—the Democrats, the Biden administration—the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country—we will now bring in brilliant, hard-working, job-creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.

Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years, the Federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America's potential in every possible way. The Nation founded by pioneers and risk takers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt.

Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of Federal workers who have not been showing up to work.

My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. Any Federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately, because we are draining the swamp. It's very simple. And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.

And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there. They're waiting for you to vote.

And I'm sure that the people on my right—I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here—I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because, otherwise, I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that.

But I know this group is going to be voting for the taxes.

Thank you. It's a very, very big part of our plan. We had tremendous success in our first term with it. A very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board.

And to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation, I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.

[The President addressed Speaker Johnson.]

Good luck.

And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America.

And by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody has ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made. Never seen—that's a combination of the election win and tariffs.

It's a beautiful word, isn't it?

That, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today—all three—the top people, and they're so excited. In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.

And this has taken place since our great victory on November 5, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country.

In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100-percent expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20, 2025, and it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term—we had a great first term.

If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and, in some cases, a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries.

On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico, and Canada—have you heard of them?—and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 percent. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that: four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea, but that's what happens.

This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so, on April 2—I wanted to make it April 1, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. [Laughter] That's what—that's not—just one day, which cost us a lot of money. [Laughter] But we're going to do it on April—I'm a very superstitious person—April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in. And whatever they tariff us—other countries—we will tariff them. That's reciprocal, back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.

If they do nonmonetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do nonmonetary barriers to keep them out of our market. There's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in their market.

We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China, and I did it with others. And the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because it was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it.

We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.

Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.

They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars. And the United States will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.

Thanks to our ""America first"" policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies—the people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle—Larry Ellison—announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won.

Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me. He said, ""I cannot spend it fast enough."" It's going to be much higher than that, I believe. They'll be building their plants here, instead of in China.

And just yesterday Taiwan Semiconductor—the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount—97 percent—of the market—announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A.

And we're not giving them any money. Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money, and they don't spend it. All that meant to them—we're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs, so they came, and they're building. And many other companies are coming.

We don't have to give them money. We just want to protect our businesses and our people. And they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. And so it's very amazing.

You should get rid of the CHIP Act. And whatever is left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.

Our new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer—I love the farmer—who will now be selling into our home market, the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other companies—countries and companies, they're—really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting, and they come in and they pour in, and they hurt our American farmers.

The tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America. And our farmers, starting on April 2—it may be a little bit of an adjustment period. We had that before, when I made the deal with China. Fifty billion dollars of purchases, and I said, ""Just bear with me,"" and they did. They did. Probably have to bear with me again, and this will be even better.

That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. Fifty billion dollars of purchases, and we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it. And it hurt our farmers, but our farmers are going to have a field day right now.

So, to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you too. I love you too. It's all going to happen.

And I have also imposed a 25-percent tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber, and steel, because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and, frankly, won't have—we just won't have a country very long.

Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department; raise seven children with his beautiful wife Nicole; and over the years, provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff.

Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff.

Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs. They're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly.

There will be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much.

Audience member. No, we're not!

The President. No, you're not. Oh. [Laughter]

And look—and look where Biden took us. Very low. The lowest we've ever been.

Jeff, I want to thank you very much.

And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it. A very loving person. Our magnificent First Lady of the United States. Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our Nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce.

Our First Lady is joined by two impressive young women—very impressive: Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Lady's Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education and become a teacher, and Elliston Berry, who became a victim of an illicit deepfake image produced by a peer. With Elliston's help, the Senate just passed the TAKE IT DOWN Act, and—this is so important. Thank you very much, John. John Thune, thank you. Stand up, John. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.

And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. A great job.

To criminalize the publication of such images online. This terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you.

And I'm going to use that bill for myself too, if you don't mind—[laughter]—because nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody. [Laughter]

That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.

But if we truly care about protecting America's children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past 4 years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world. Because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open-border policies, they are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast.

And I want to thank Tom Homan. And, Kristi, I want to thank you. And Paul of Border Patrol, I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE. Law enforcement, in general, is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement. We have to.

Last year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student named Laken Riley—the best in her class, admired by everybody—went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning, Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Laken was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then set loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration.

He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city—a disaster—before ending the life of this beautiful young angel.

With us this evening are Laken's beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.

Last year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th President mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. It's a very strong, powerful act. It's called the Laken Riley Act.

So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. [Applause] Thank you very much.

Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history, and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you.

The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. ""We must have legislation to secure the border."" But it turned out that all we really needed was a new President.

Audience members. Trump! Trump! Trump!

The President. Thank you.

Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals, and communities throughout the country. Entire towns, like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody has ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed.

Now, just as I promised in my Inaugural Address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.

Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know: Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis's 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for 2 hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela, released into America by the last administration through"
