The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at : a.m., in Room SD- , Dirksen Senate Office Building, Honorable Bernard Sanders, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Sanders, Murray, Wyden, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Warner, Merkley, Kaine, Van Hollen, Lujan, Padilla, Graham, Grassley, Crapo, Toomey, Braun, Scott, Sasse, and Kennedy. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BERNARD SANDERS Chairman Sanders. Okay. Let me convene this hearing, the purpose of which is to speak with Ms. Shalanda Young, who has been nominated by the President to be Deputy OMB Director. And let me thank my colleague who are here with us in person. I know Chuck Grassley is in back, and others will be coming. Senator Graham is a little bit late but he will be here shortly. And we thank those who are participating remotely. We are here today to consider the nomination of Shalanda Young to become the next Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. As we all know, the OMB is responsible for preparing the President's budget, reviewing Federal regulations, and providing the proper oversight of Federal agencies. It is a very important task. For the past years, Ms. Young has served as a top staffer on the House Appropriations Committee and has done an excellent job in working with Democrats and Republicans on legislation that must be passed each and every year that impacts the lives of tens of millions, and we thank her very much for her years of public service. Today, in America, it is no great secret that we are living through one of the most difficult periods in the modern history of our country. We have a terrible crisis with the pandemic, where we have lost half a million Americans, and we are also living through a terrible economic downturn. The real unemployment rate in America today is over percent. Over million Americans are either unemployed, underemployed, or have given up looking for work. More than half of the workers in our country today, unbelievably, in the richest country on earth, are living paycheck to paycheck. That means if your car breaks down, your kid gets sick, you are facing a terrible financial emergency. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth, and we hope, by the way, to address that through the American Rescue Plan Act that we will be discussing this week on the floor of the Senate. And in the midst of all that, we have a massive level of income and wealth inequality, which this Committee actually will be discussing in the near future. The COVID- pandemic is still raging across the country and is responsible for taking the lives of some , Americans. At the same time, unbelievably, we have million Americans who are either uninsured or underinsured. In other words, we have a major health care crisis and are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people, as a human right. We have, in the midst of all of this, not just an American but a global climate crisis that threatens the well-being of the planet. We have an affordable housing crisis, where millions of people are paying half of their limited incomes on rent. Half a million people are sleeping out on the streets. We have a racial injustice crisis, and we will accelerate our effort to fight systemic racism. We have an immigration crisis that must be addressed. It has been ignored for too long. In other words, this country today faces an unprecedented set of crises that must be addressed. And guess what? A lot of those priorities, a lot of those issues are going to fall within the purview of OMB, including the Director of the OMB. Ms. Young, I look forward to working with you as the Deputy OMB Director, to enact the promises that the Biden administration has made to the American people, and that is to increase the Federal minimum wage to $ an hour; to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for working families, and to substantially reduce student debt; to lower the Medicare eligibility age, and to substantially lower prescription drugs costs in this country; to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs and combat climate change; to make pre-K universal for every - and -year-old in America, and make child care affordable to every family in this country; to make sure that every worker in America has at least weeks of paid family and medical leave; and, in fact, in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality, to make sure that the wealthiest people and the most profitable corporations start to pay their fair share of taxes. Those are not my ideas. That is what the Biden administration has been talking about. And the job of OMB and the Deputy Director of the OMB, to my mind, is to make sure that we keep faith with the American people, that we implement what the President has been talking about. So let me thank Ms. Young for being with us. I look forward to your testimony, and now let me give the microphone over to Ranking Member Lindsey Graham for his opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think you are a highly qualified person for the job. Everybody that deals with you on our side has nothing but good things to say. You might talk me out of voting for you, but I doubt it. Thank you. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Mr. Graham, for that cogent and brief remark. My colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, wants to introduce Ms. Young. Can we roll the film, so to speak. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE PATRICK LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. I am very happy to be here today to introduce Shalanda Young. She is President Biden's nominee to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Now, for the members of this Committee who also sit on the Appropriations Committee, Shalanda is a familiar face. She has worked on the House Appropriations Committee for nearly years. She has been the House Appropriations Staff Director since . Actually, it is in that capacity I had the pleasure to really get to know her well, and I can tell you, without reservation, I can think of no one better suited to be Deputy Director of OMB than Shalanda. Her deep understanding of the often arcane Federal budget process, her years of experience on the Appropriations Committee, her tenacity, her dedication to public service, her honesty will serve the agency and the American people. Shalanda began her career in public service in , at the National Institutes of Health. She came first to work on Capitol Hill as a detailee with the House Appropriation Committee in . She really made a good impression because she returned in . She worked her way up in the committee over the years. Her work in developing the budget and conducted oversight of key agencies has given her critical insights into the operation of some of our nation's most important agencies, including, of course, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, the General Service Administration. She even served as a staff director for the Legislative Branch Subcommittee overseeing the budget for Congress. Then she became Staff Director of the House Appropriations Committee in . Coincidentally, that was the same year I became Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. And since that time she has helped the House navigate some of the most difficult issues before the chamber. She has a reputation as a tough, but fair negotiator. That is high praise on Capitol Hill, and I can attest to the truth of these statements. I have seen these skills first-hand. Let me tell you a story. Shalanda was a critical figure in helping to end the government shutdown in January of . Now I remember the evening we cut the final deal to end the -day government shutdown, the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Chairman Shelby, Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Kay Granger, and I, along with only a very few but highly trusted staff, went to my office in the Capitol. We continued talks that started earlier that day. We wanted to get away from being watched by everybody, from the lobbyists, to the press, away from the cameras. We wanted to see if we could reach a deal. Fortunately, Shalanda was with us. As we worked into the night on these difficult issues, her knowledge of a vast range of Federal programs, her understanding of the political process, and her determination to get the country we love back on track helped us reach a deal. We shook hands on it that night, and we went out, the four of us--two Republicans, two Democrats--and we announced it to the press. If you look closely at pictures of that moment, Shalanda is there in the background. Hopefully she is as proud of that moment as I am. It was a difficult time for our nation, but through determination and hard work we reached a solution, and that is what Shalanda is best at. She knows how to work across the aisle to get a deal done. Her relationships with both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate will serve her well. I have heard it said that the Office of Management and Budget is one of the most powerful government agencies, that most Americans have never heard of. It is true. It wields incredible influence over not just the Federal budget but over policies that affect people's lives. We need people like Shalanda Young to help steer the agency in these important decisions. She is wonderful. Chairman Sanders. Senator Leahy, thank you very much. And now, under the rules of the Committee, nominees are required to testify under oath. Ms. Young, would you please rise. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear the testimony that you will give the Senate Budget Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Ms. Young. I do. Chairman Sanders. If asked to do so, and if given reasonable notice, will you agree to appear before this Committee in the future and answer any questions that the members of this Committee might have? Ms. Young. I do. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much. Please be seated, and we would love to hear your remarks. TESTIMONY OF SHALANDA D. YOUNG, OF LOUISIANA, TO BE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET Ms. Young. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Graham, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today as President Biden's nominee for Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I want to thank Chairman Leahy for introducing me to the Committee today. One of the joys of being Staff Director of the Appropriations Committee has been seeing the amazing relationships and results that have come from Senator Leahy, Senator Shelby, Ranking Member Granger, and my former boss, Chairwoman Lowey. I still vividly remember the same story that you just heard from Chairman Leahy, those four meeting to avert another government shutdown. We had just opened for weeks and we needed to find a deal quickly, back in February of . Even in those tense moments, Senator Leahy still took the time to show me pictures of his beloved family before announcing to the press that a compromise had been reached. I will be forever grateful for the kindness Senator Leahy has always shown, even in the most stressful environments. I am accompanied today by my parents, Loyce and Ronald Smith, who are here from Louisiana. My -year-old grandmother, who is still in Louisiana, could not make it due to COVID- precautions. I want to thank them and my extended family for their unwavering support over the years. Members of this distinguished Committee, I come before you today as someone who grew up in rural America. I spent most of my youth in Clinton, Louisiana. Back then, Clinton had a population of around , people. It is where my maternal great-grandparents lived, got married, and had my grandmother in . Somehow, even then, in the segregated South, my great- grandparents sent their child, my grandmother, to college. I am grateful they prioritized education, a commitment that has stayed in my family for generations. All families deserve to see their children have that same opportunity to pursue their potential. Another former boss of mine, Chairman Obey--and I am sorry if he ever yelled at you-- used to say a budget is your values. I share that belief, and firmly believe the Federal budget can and should help make the promise of this country real for all families, in all communities. I have spent the last years as both the Minority and Majority Staff Director of the House Appropriations Committee. I care deeply about the institution of Congress and have been very proud to serve in a position that required compromise to ensure the American people had not only a functioning government, but one that invested in their future. My work on the Appropriations Committee taught me that both sides can compromise without compromising their values, even when that means no one gets everything they want. I will forever be indebted to this institution, and if confirmed, I look forward to using my experience in the halls of Congress to ensure both branches operate with mutual respect and work toward solutions that will improve the lives of those we all serve. I am not naive about the challenges we face. Last year, I worked on the first COVID supplemental that Congress passed in March of . We were using models of past supplementals on Ebola and Zika because the full scale of the pandemic was still unclear. With COVID deaths surpassing , , our focus must remain on beating the virus, delivering immediate relief to millions of struggling Americans, and ensuring that we emerge from this crisis even stronger than we were before. If confirmed, I look forward to engaging with Members of Congress from both parties on this and other important work. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Graham, and other members of the Committee, thank you for allowing me to appear before this Committee, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Young appears on ] Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Ms. Young. Let me begin the questioning, and, in a sense, the questions I am going to ask you do not come from me, really. They come from the President, and I just wanted to make sure that you are on the same page as the President in terms of some of the most important issues facing our country. So I am going to ask you the questions and your answers can be very, very brief. The President has indicated strong support for increasing the minimum wage in our country from $ . an hour to $ . an hour. Do you agree with him? Ms. Young. Absolutely, Chairman Sanders. Chairman Sanders. The President has made clear that he wants to see public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling student debt, not completely, but making progress in canceling student debt for working families making less than $ , a year. Do you agree with that? Ms. Young. Yes, Senator Sanders. Chairman Sanders. The President has indicated that he wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare from to and expand Medicare coverage to include hearing, vision, and dental care. Is that something you support? Ms. Young. Yes, Senator Sanders. Chairman Sanders. Good. The President has indicated that he wants to see Medicare begin negotiating prices with the pharmaceutical industry to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs in America. Is that something you support? Ms. Young. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. The President has indicated that he supports guaranteeing weeks of paid family and medical leave. Is that something you support? Ms. Young. Absolutely. Chairman Sanders. Okay. The President has indicated that he supports providing universal pre-K education to every - and - year-old in the country and making child care more affordable for working families. Is that something you are comfortable with? Ms. Young. I have seen it work in my own family. Yes, sir. Chairman Sanders. Okay. The President has indicated, and we will be discussing more of that in the next several months, creating millions of good-paying jobs by investing at least $ trillion to combat climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels into renewable energy. Is that something you are comfortable with? Ms. Young. Yes, sir. Chairman Sanders. The President has indicated that he supports creating millions of additional good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, our roads, bridges, sidewalks, schools, water systems, wastewater plants, et cetera. Is that something that you are comfortable with? Ms. Young. Yes, sir, and I have worked on it a lot of my appropriations career. Chairman Sanders. Okay. Those are my questions, Ms. Young. Thank you very much. Senator Graham? Senator Graham. Thank you. What is the price tag of all that? Chairman Sanders. Uh---- Ms. Young. Senator Graham, as you know a lot of these do have high price tags. Senator Graham. Oh, just within a trillion or so, what is it? Ms. Young. It is some very important, you know---- Senator Graham. You know I am going to vote for you, but I just---- Ms. Young. I get it. It is expensive. Senator Graham. But I just want, like, people back home to know, okay, all that sounds good but, I mean, what does it cost? Ms. Young. It sounds good, but I think you have to talk about the details. So when we talk about the global cost if---- Senator Graham. Is it fair to say you cannot give me a price tag today but you will work on it and get me one later? Ms. Young. I will work on it---- Senator Graham. And give me one later? Ms. Young. --there are some details, I think there are some bipartisan nuggets in those infrastructure packages and others, I am sure we will get the opportunity to work on together. Senator Graham. Are you worried about a run on our border, southern border, if we keep changing the policies of immigration? Ms. Young. You can imagine I have spent a lot of time on this the last years, and I have spent some time down in Southern California and Texas. Senator Graham. Yeah. Ms. Young. You visit one part of the border, you have not visited another part. It is all very different, the topography. So, yeah, I believe---- Senator Graham. Well, let's just talk about policy. Forget about topography here. The Remain in Mexico policy of the Trump administration required people seeking asylum in the United States to stay in Mexico until their court date. Do you think that was a beneficial change? Ms. Young. I think there were some side effects that were not--I think of us as a country, including lack of access to counsel. Frankly, that if you are interested---- Senator Graham. Well, we are talking about waiting there until your court date. I mean, there are a million and a half, over a million person backlog in the asylum system. Are you concerned that if we go back to the old policy allowing people to be processed in the United States, released in the United States for a court date years in the future, most do not show up, that that will entice more people to come here to seek asylum? Ms. Young. Senator Graham, I think the speed in which our immigration system works is a bipartisan one. No one wants an asylum system that takes years and years and years. I think one of the unfortunate side effects of Remain in Mexico is you do take---- Senator Graham. Do you support changing that policy, eliminating it? Ms. Young. Yeah, I do think we need to, and think as the administration is taking a pause and looking to make sure we have an immigration system that works. Senator Graham. They are expecting to be , unaccompanied minors to hit our border in May. Why do you think the increase? Ms. Young. You know, I have not seen the figures you are using. I think you are well-known as someone who has reached across the aisle for solutions. The only way we are going to find any solutions in immigration is a bipartisan one. So yeah, I am concerned, but I do think there are solutions. Senator Graham. Let me just, you know, again, you are highly qualified for the job and I am going to vote for you. But, you know, Senator Sanders gave sort of a laundry list of things that you need to support, that the Biden administration is proposing. Maybe we can find common ground. Maybe we cannot. But I worked on about every gang bill there is around here for immigration, and what I see is a retreat on policies that worked. I was in Arizona a couple of weeks ago, and this time this year versus last year there has been almost a percent increase in people coming to our border. So for us to get immigration right we are going to have to turn off the magnets that draw people here and try to replace illegal immigration with legal immigration. Do you support more work visas, legal work visas for the American economy? Ms. Young. Senator Graham, there are several work visa program. I am no expert on them but I do know there are reforms in the works in the halls of Congress. There are some that need more reform than others. So yes, I do think the visa programs are necessary, but I do support congressional work on necessary reforms where they are needed, and I know a lot of that work is ongoing. Senator Graham. Do you think you are ready to be Director if that job was offered to you? Ms. Young. Senator Graham, thank you for the question. I am here nominated as Deputy Director. I hope, after today, you find me qualified for that position, and I look forward to hopefully winning your support. Senator Graham. Well, you will get my support, maybe for both jobs. Who knows. Thanks. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Graham. Now we are going to hear from Senator Murray via video. Senator Murray. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and before I begin I do want to reiterate my support for Neera Tanden's nomination to be OMB Director. I have known and worked closely with Neera for many years. So whether you agree with her on every issue or not, you cannot question her passion, her knowledge, her engagement on the issues so critical to families in our communities. I believe Ms. Tanden would excel and be director. I hope the Committee, and really the full Senate, will swiftly move to advance her nomination. Today I am very pleased we have the opportunity to speak today with Shalanda Young, who I believe is an excellent choice for this role. Ms. Young will bring a wealth of experience to the job. She has a deep understanding of the Federal budget and the appropriations process, and the know-how of working with agencies and Members of Congress to make progress on a range of critical issues. As our country faces multiple crises, the role of OMB is critical to addressing these challenges head on, from navigating the current public health crisis, to stabilizing our economy, to confronting the climate crisis, to addressing the rampant inequality throughout our society. So, Ms. Young, my question for you today is how do you see this administration prioritizing investments to tackle those crises, and what is the economic case for strong and decisive actions to meet this moment? Ms. Young. Thank you, Senator Murray, and it is good to see you. I have certainly been a fan from the other side of the Appropriations Committee in the House. I think you all will be busy working on the first order of business this week. If we do not take full steps to crush the virus, the economics of it are going to come home tenfold. President Biden has certainly talked about the next step being the need to invest in infrastructure. During the regular appropriations process we do the best we can, especially with budget caps, but the types of investments that are needed to ensure that this country remains an economic leader and competes with the Chinas of the world, we have to invest in our roads, bridges--I am sorry Senator Graham is gone--our dredging projects. Army Corps is woefully in need of additional funding, if we want our shipping lanes to remain open. So I certainly, if confirmed, look forward to working with Congress on those big investments, because if we go too little, if we do not do what is needed now, and I worked on the Great Recession package, and one of the complaints was, in , it was not big enough. So you certainly have my commitment to work with Congress, I think on many pieces that have been bipartisan in the past, to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much. You know, from the beginning of this pandemic I said historic crises like these demand bold solutions. It is so important the Senate continues to move quickly this week to pass COVID relief and get direct relief to all those who are struggling, and to start our country on a path to more equitable future on the other side of this pandemic. Before I close I do want to again raise an issue of critical importance to Washington State, and that is the cleanup of the Hanford nuclear site. I talked about this previously with Ms. Tanden. I look forward to also working in close partnership with you to make sure the Hanford mission is on a cost-effective trajectory without compromising cleanup, and I look forward to talking with you about that once you are confirmed. And finally, Ms. Young, I do want to thank you for your willingness to serve in this position at such a critical time in this country. I look forward to supporting this nomination. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the time this morning. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Senator Murray. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. There are not many people on the professional staff of the Appropriations Committee who are anxious to get away, so I question your judgment, but I am glad for your public service. It happens that I am more interested in OMB from the standpoint of what it does on regulatory review than what I do in regard to the budget part of your work. So I am going to start out there, and I only have one question in that area. The president memo entitled, quote/unquote, ``Modernizing Regulatory Review'' directs OMB to update its guidance to agencies to, quote, ``fully account for regulatory benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify.'' Under the implementation of this memo, how will agencies be instructed to compare quantitative and non-quantitative benefits and costs, and how does that differ from the current cost benefit analysis framework? Ms. Young. Thank you, Senator. I thought you might talk about this. I want to reiterate something you heard from the nominee for the Director job, that the underlying Executive Order has been reaffirmed by President Biden, and that has served both Republican and Democratic administrations, and it says we must do cost benefit analysis of regulations. What the improving and modernizing plan you have outlined, which I certainly hope to have a role as Deputy of looking at the regulatory process, is an effort to ensure that we are reaching communities. I talked about one that I grew up in. Oftentimes it is hard to quantify when you are looking at towns of , , whether the benefit outweighs a small group of people. There might be high costs, but that does not mean we should not be doing something to make those rural lives, the lives of people who might be from minority racial backgrounds, those people living with disabilities, those things may not come out well in a regular cost benefit analysis, but I think we can all agree that we need to ensure that those amongst us who need the most help, we find a way. And I think that memo that you talked about is tasking us with finding a way to make sure we do not leave certain Americans behind. Senator Grassley. Okay. Thank you. Another thing that bothers me over several decades is the fact that the Department of Defense (DOD) is the only department of government that can't get a, what you call kind of a certified statement of fiscal responsibility, a clean audit I guess you would call it. The Department of Defense relies on hundreds of outdated legacy financial management systems. These systems cannot produce reliable data and are one major obstacle to preventing the DOD from obtaining what I said, a clean audit opinion. How would you approach this issue through the authority of the OMB, assuming you have authority, and I am not sure that I am up to date on that, and ensure that these systems are replaced or fixed so that they are able to generate complete and reliable financial data needed to support clean opinions? Ms. Young. As you can imagine, I have certainly looked at this from the appropriations angle, and, by the way, it was a difficult decision leaving someplace I have been and loved for a long time, so thanks for acknowledging that but hopefully I can continue to be in service, if confirmed. I think part of the issue, DOD is not the only one that has legacy systems that do not serve them well when it comes to managing their financial house. Part of the problem is a resource problem. We often, the choice, when it comes to Congress, and, you know, OMB as well, look at the traditional spending of DOD. So do you need a new submarine or do you need an IT system? Well, we probably need both, but it tends to not be the jazziest thing that can be sold in the halls of Congress. So you certainly have my commitment to work with you, and I certainly will work with the Pentagon, because this is, I think the least we owe the American people, to ensure that we can show that these agencies have clean financial audits. Senator Grassley. Okay. I have only got eight seconds left. For decades, tax regulation generally skipped the review process other agencies had to follow in submitting significant regulations to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) at OMB for review. This changed in , when the Treasury Department and OMB entered into an agreement to subject significant tax regulations to OIRA review. Do you expect the Biden administration to maintain that agreement? Ms. Young. Senator, I expect we will use this improving and modernizing memo to review, and that will be one of the things, and I would love to work with your staff on this issue and make sure we are getting your concerns as we are looking at this review process. Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator. Senator Wyden. Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and for holding this important hearing. I just want to touch, for a quick moment, on the matter of Neera Tanden's nomination, because I think colleagues should know that she is very much interested in two bipartisan priorities of a number of members. For example, Senator Grassley and I put together a bill to stop pharmaceutical price gouging, and we basically said if these companies are selling things like insulin and they are jacking up the prices again and again and again, which they have, they basically have to make rebates if they ever raise prices above inflation, bipartisan support. We also support the effort that Chairman Sanders is talking about here today, which is Medicare negotiating the cost of prescription drugs. So these are bipartisan issues. The same has been true in terms of rural America, and I asked Ms. Tanden about a matter that I am pursuing with Senator Crapo and Senator Risch, trying to help the rural communities get off the roller coaster with respect to their payments, and we continue to strengthen the Secure Rural Schools Program. So Ms. Tanden, as members consider her nomination, on prescription drugs and on the question of jobs for rural America, has a bipartisan track record. I would also like to say that I am very much looking forward to supporting Ms. Young for this crucial position as well, and I want to ask her about just a couple of quick questions. I think we all know that millions of Americans are unemployed right now. Unemployment insurance expires March th. And dollar for dollar, there really are not multipliers out there like helping people who are laid off through no fault of their own, because those funds that they get are used for making rent and buying groceries and paying for medicine, and kids' shoes. And there has been a major limitation is that politicians can set an arbitrary end date for the coverage that folks and communities need to stay afloat. I have recently proposed, again, with the support of Chairman Sanders and a number of other colleagues in the Senate, to basically tie this assistance to economic conditions on the ground, and the unemployment and relief checks should basically be part of a stabilizer kind of system so that we do not get into another situation like we had in the last big recession, where we simply had gone too small. We ought to put these programs on approach tied to economic conditions on the ground what is called an automatic stabilizer, and I am very pleased to be working on this with Chairman Sanders and a number of colleagues. Ms. Young, we have been impressed by the fact that President Biden is very interested in this idea. Should you be confirmed for this position, tell us a little bit about your thoughts, and we would very much like to have a ringing endorsement today as well. Ms. Young. Senator Wyden, thank you for the question. So even though I have been on the Appropriations Committee, we have had the privilege of putting these packages together so I am absolutely familiar with the stabilizer idea. I know a lot of Senators and House members have tried to bring this to fruition. I am certainly supportive. I think we are about to hit another cliff on March th, you know, which is unfortunate, and I think last time we did not make the time frame, so we have people who have to deal with these gaps in assistance, which should be avoided. I also understand, from the congressional standpoint, some of the hurdles to tackling the stabilizer issue has been Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scoring. It is tough. The way scoring does has just made it an expensive proposition. But I think it is important enough, we have to keep working to find a way to make sure millions of Americans do not face these artificial cliffs in their unemployment benefits. Senator Wyden. Well, thank you, Ms. Young. I have got one other question, but, you know, what you are really touching on is the heart of what we want to do. We want to empower communities and we want to empower folks who have been laid off, through no fault of their own, to be in a position to get on with their lives. Let's empower them rather than politicians, who are the ones who, in effect, if they can set an arbitrary date, they are the ones who use those dates for leverage. We ought to be empowering people. Let me ask you about one last issue, very quickly, that is important to tribes in my State. OMB currently faces a decision on the poorly made recommendations of the Public Buildings Reform Board to close National Archives and Records in Seattle, Washington. This decision affect Oregonians, including our Klamath Tribes who rely on their access to important historical records. We sent a bipartisan letter to OMB detailing our concerns about how Native Americans and Alaskan Natives in the Northwest were not consulted. Do you commit to working with all of us to increase transparency of the process, get more input, and particularly consult with the tribes before any final recommendations are instituted? Ms. Young. Absolutely, Senator. I have been involved in many decisions and fighting those from the congressional side when offices close. I understand the intense need these regional and local offices are to ensure that people can petition and get services from their governments. So you certainly have my commitment to work with you. Senator Wyden. My time is up. I have heard nothing but positive things about you, Ms. Young, and your work, and I look forward to supporting your nomination. Ms. Young. Thank you, sir. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Wyden. Senator Toomey. Senator Toomey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Young, welcome to the Committee, and I know that this is not your decision but I do have to express just how deeply disappointed I am that President Biden and our Democratic colleagues have decided to undertake a purely partisan process to pass a bill with so much content that has absolutely nothing to do with COVID or an economic recovery, and that, despite the fact that last year Congress passed five-five--overwhelmingly bipartisan bills in response to the pandemic and the economic disaster that we faced. Those bills added up to almost $ trillion. Each one of them got over votes. The last bill, which was the second-largest economic relief bill in American history, was signed just about eight weeks ago. Hundreds of billions of dollars are still unspent. The economy is in a strong recovery mode. And absolutely there are pockets that are doing very badly, but on balance and in the aggregate, the economy is doing very, very well. And despite all that, rather than working with Republicans on identifying the areas that have been left behind, despite all of this massive, massive spending, the approach is just ignore Republicans, do a partisan approach, and spend almost $ trillion, the vast majority of which has nothing to do with COVID or the economic circumstances we are in. Even liberal Democratic economic advisors are warning--Larry Summers has famously said about this bill, that it brings on some big risks. The result could be inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation. So I really am very, very disappointed that this is the path that we are on. I want to just be clear about some of the specifics, as I understand them, from the House-passed bill that has arrived at the Senate. Can you confirm that a family of four with an income of $ , last year, that had no income decline, no income interruption whatsoever as a result of the pandemic and the lockdowns, that already received $ , , in addition to all the ordinary six-figure income, and under this bill they will get another $ , from taxpayers. Is that accurate? Ms. Young. Senator Toomey, I do believe the House bill is very similar to the bipartisan ones you mentioned earlier, so yes. Senator Toomey. Yeah, so this is breathtaking for most Americans, that affluent families, with no interruption whatsoever in their income, having already gotten $ , from taxpayers, now they are going to get yet another $ , . It is as if money grows on trees, and the Federal Government should be in the business of sending affluent people checks, maybe periodically, maybe regularly. There is just no rational basis for this. Let me ask you this. In , we now know that according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis--that is part of the Commerce Department--the aggregate revenue collected by State and local governments hit an all-time record high. There are a lot of reasons for it but that is the fact, all-time record high in . And that is separate and apart, that is revenue that they collected. That is separate from the $ billion that went to State and local governments over the course of last year, under a variety of bills. Now we are told that the House bill and the Biden proposal is to send yet another $ billion. Isn't it actually quite likely that a number of States are simply, with all of this cash being thrown at them, they are going to cut taxes at the State level. Don't you think that is a reasonably likely outcome? Ms. Young. Senator, you talked about President Biden's bipartisanship. He continues to outreach to governors on both sides of the aisle who continue to say that they are in need. It is not just a revenue loss fund but also one in which we expect those States and locals to continue to provide necessary services as people depend on their local units of government. Senator Toomey. I understand, but if you are collecting an all-time record level of revenue, probably you can provide the services that ordinarily provide, and if in addition to an all- time record amount of revenue you got half a trillion dollars from the Federal Government, it seems like there is lots of money to go around. Last question. I wonder, do you think there is any downside whatsoever, any reason at all, any concerns, about systematically paying people more not to work than they make working, designing an unemployment system whereby a very substantial percentage of workers will get paid more to sit at home than they get paid to go to their work? Is this how we should demonstrate our commitment to the dignity of work? Ms. Young. That was a phrase I was going to use. Certainly people I know from all walks of life have dignity of work. They are not accepting government assistance, in my opinion, and in some of the data we have seen they are using this enhanced unemployment to make ends meet. Senator Toomey. I see my time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Toomey. Senator Stabenow. Senator Stabenow. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. First, Ms. Young, congratulations on your nomination. I have heard nothing but extremely positive things, both from Democrats and Republicans, and I look forward to working with you if you are confirmed, which hopefully will happen. I also strongly support Neera Tanden, and I think the two of you would be really an excellent pair, and I am hopeful that we will have both of you. I do want to say to my friend who just spoke that when we talk about bipartisanship, certainly in the last year in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act we had a bipartisan deal. We moved on some things, but then we got to, I think it was May, and the Senate Republican leader said he thought no more needed to be done at that point, you know, that things were okay, we did not need to act. It took from May until December to pass additional support for American families and to address the pandemic and issues around trying to get children back to school safely. We do not have that much time now. We just do not have time to wait another six, eight months. What we have is bipartisan support in the country, and we have got to get as many shots in people's arms in possible. We have got to help people in small businesses, small family farms get through and survive this pandemic, and we have got to make sure every child can get back into school safely, period. And so I am glad we are moving, and we certainly would welcome bipartisan support from our colleagues in the Senate. Now on question, let me just say that when I talk--there are so many things on your plate that I want to talk specifics on things that I am involved with. As the Chairwoman of Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, right now when we look at the climate crisis we have a great potential to harness our farms and forests as leaders in tackling the climate crisis. And I am working on several bipartisan bills, along with my great friend, Senator Braun, and other colleagues, and I look forward to working with the administration to enact them, which will give Secretary Vilsack and others at U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) new tools to address this urgent issue, in a voluntary, bipartisan, producer-led way, which is our focus. So if confirmed, will you commit to working with us to prioritize climate-smart agriculture and forestry investments in the President's upcoming budgets and through other actions at the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere? Ms. Young. You have my absolute commitment to work with you on those very important issues. Senator Stabenow. Great. Let me talk about something else that is certainly at the forefront in the pandemic, and that is the mental health of millions and millions and millions of Americans. We have traditionally, historically underfunded behavioral health systems in this country. The good news is that we are making progress. My friend, Senator Roy Blunt, and I have been leading efforts strongly supported on both sides of the aisle, to improve quality care through the creation of new certified community behavioral health clinics. These clinics, among other things, require high-quality standards, -hour, -day-a-week crisis services, outpatient mental health care, substance abuse care, and working with emergency rooms, law enforcement, and veterans' groups, which is very important. So when we look at this we are actually saving money as well as doing something very effective. The last Health and Human Services (HHS) budget found that these services led to a percent decrease in emergency department visits for behavioral health, percent reduction in time spent in jail, which is why this is so strongly supported by sheriffs and police chiefs and so on, and a percent decrease in homelessness. The challenge for us is quantifying that in terms of the budget. First of all, we should be covering these service in health care above the neck as well as below the neck, and could you talk about the role of OMB in quantifying some of the downstream savings from increased access to behavioral health care, and can we count on you to focus on those issues in upcoming budgets? Ms. Young. You absolutely can, and I am very proud of the behavioral and mental health funding in the current COVID package. It is much needed. It is an area, again, where I think the regular appropriations process--would have loved to have done more, but we have certainly been living under budget caps for the last ten years. So COVID has exacerbated these problems. It is appropriate that it be in this package, and I am glad to see that it is. Senator, you certainly have my commitment to helping quantify the benefits of this funding and working to ensure we have adequate funding and do better by those line items. Senator Stabenow. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I think probably my time is up. I will just follow up with Ms. Young about another passionate, important topic, which is making sure that we are supporting all efforts to protect our Great Lakes. So thank you very much. I look forward to supporting your confirmation. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Senator Stabenow. Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Young, how are you? Ms. Young. Good, sir. How are you? Senator Kennedy. I am okay. I want to ask you about the proclivity of the Federal Government to persist in paying dead people. You probably read about it, but last--let me see here-- last spring, when we sent out our first batch of coronavirus relief checks, we paid out $ . billion to deceased Americans. And we do not get this money back, and, of course, in some instances, in many instances the checks are cashed, which obviously is indicative of fraud. We have passed legislation, and let me back up. We are not sure how much we pay out in checks to dead people every year, but it is a lot. It is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars, and there is a lot of fraud involved. The Congress passed legislation to try to fix this problem. I will not bore you with the details, but because of the politics we had to put in a provision that the legislation would not really take effect for years. So we basically had to agree, because of the politics, that we would continue to pay dead people for more years. Can you do something about that when you are running OMB? Ms. Young. Senator Kennedy, I think you have pursued this. I know it is very important. You pursued it in the Financial Services construction of Appropriations Committee so I am very familiar with your work here and your consistent drumbeat. I think part of this is the government systems. We talked about this earlier, with a different Senator, is we have to do better with our IT systems. That is definitely part of the problem, and I will certainly commit to working, just like I did previously, in improving these systems so that we--no one wants fraud, waste, and abuse in important government programs. It does a disservice to those who really need government services. It puts a target on their back. So I think there is a bipartisan commitment to make sure we do what we can to weed out---- Senator Kennedy. Can I interrupt you, Ms. Young---- Ms. Young. Yes, sir. Senator Kennedy. --because, look, I have watched you and I have followed your career, and you are a very smart person and I think you can fix this. And, to me it is very simple. We, meaning the Federal Government, get data every year, every month, every day from the States about who died. It is not perfect data but we get it, and it goes into a database at the Federal Government. But the group in charge of maintaining that database does not really share it with other agencies. It is complicated. It is needlessly complicated. And I think that you are a very smart person. I think that if you said, look, you call the White House, speak to the President, and say, ``Mr. President, this is low-hanging fruit. We really need to stop paying dead people. It is embarrassing. And Congress has acted on it but because of the politics it had to delay the implementation of the bill for years. Can't we, Mr. President, issue some sort of Executive order and stop paying dead people? I mean, don't we owe that, at least to the taxpayers?'' And I know it is complicated, you know, but it is needlessly complicated. It is very simple. We have the data. It may not be perfect, but it is better than nothing, but we continue to send out the checks. And I think you are going to be running OMB. I think you could stop it. Ms. Young. Well, Senator Kennedy---- Senator Kennedy. I have full confidence in you. Ms. Young. Thank you for the full confidence. I appreciate that. If I am confirmed as Deputy you certainly have my commitment to work with you on this. You have raised some good points. Senator Kennedy. You may be more than Deputy. You may be the sheriff. I do not expect you to comment on that. Ms. Young. Thank you, sir. Senator Kennedy. Help me do something about this. I know you can do it. Ms. Young. I look forward to working with you. I do commit to work with you and your staff on this issue. As you said, the American people deserve a Federal Government who gets its data right, and I think it is a bipartisan effort to weed out any whiff of fraud, waste, and abuse. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Ms. Young. Thank you so much. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Whitehouse. Ms. Young, how are you? Welcome. I have two things that I want to show to you. The first is this book, which is a compilation of a whole variety of reports that relate to, as the title says, The Economic Risks of Climate Change. We all know that it is going to change our physical world. We all know that it is going to raise sea levels. We all know it is going to change temperatures, move fisheries around, change weather, create all of these physical, biological, natural consequences. But we have not focused as much as I think we should have on the economic consequences. For instance, when sea levels rise and people who have predictive capability are able to see where the sea levels are going to rise to, they are going to go to mortgage companies, and they are going to go to insurance companies, and they are going to say, ``Hey, I have got some information that you ought to have before you insure that house, or before you issue a mortgage on that house.'' So, nonetheless than Freddie Mac, the big mortgage behemoth, has warned that we are going to have a coastal property values crash when those sea level rise warnings hit the mortgage and insurance markets that support coastal property, and that it is going to be worse than the mortgage meltdown. So that is a pretty serious warning. That is just one. We have got a Nobel Prize winner, testifying under oath, about the catastrophic economic consequences we are looking at. We have got major banks. We have got the Fed. We have got foreign sovereign banks. We have got major, pretty rough corporation organizations who are not exactly eleemosynary. And they are warning, in their own interests, that this is a big deal. So I would ask you to please flip through this--we will give you a copy--because I think it is going to be really important for this administration, which has done a great job on tackling the climate change problem, at least in its early initial steps--to make sure that these warnings are made loud and clear. It is probably the most warned of hazard that we have ever seen, but because the fossil fuel industry has got so much of our Congress locked up in its grip we have not responded to those warnings. So that is one. If you could take that and also take this issue seriously. I will be hounding you about it, obviously. Ms. Young. I am from the State of Louisiana, and---- Senator Whitehouse. So you know it. Ms. Young. Yes. Senator Whitehouse. Yes. You are losing more of your coastline than I think any other state in the country right now, and Rhode Island, my State, is looking to having to redraw its map. Senator Kaine here is looking at losing Norfolk Naval Station, because you can build the piers up higher and higher at Norfolk Naval Station but you cannot build up the schools and the markets and the roads and the entire community that supports that naval station there. So the former head of his naval station has warned that in years that thing is gone. We are going to have to re-site that naval station. So this is all serious, and because of fossil fuel mischief a lot of Members of Congress will not take it seriously, and we have got to make sure people understand. So thank you. The second thing is a health care thing. I use this graph a lot. CBO, back around the time that we did the Affordable Care Act (ACA), did a prediction of American health care costs were going to rise, which is this top line. I turns out, after the Affordable Care Act got passed, health care costs did not go up so fast, and we actually got the lower line as our experience. So if you take the current projection from our lower experience and compare it to what that projection is tagged onto the previous experience, you get this green differential, which, in the next years, is $ trillion savings on Federal health care. In , we are going to hit the Medicare trust fund. We do not have much time. We have got to fix this. Nobody is going to cut benefits. But whatever is happening here that saves $ trillion, we need to do a lot more of. And I submit to you that it is quality improvements and incentives in the health care system, it is getting away from fee-for-service treadmill in the health care system, and it is really pushing the accountable care organizations, the provider Accountable Care Organizations (ACO), that are doing such a good job. I have got two of the best ones in Rhode Island. World class. They are not the best in Rhode Island. They are the best in the world. They are the best in the country. They happen to be in Rhode Island. And they are driving costs down, their patients are getting better outcomes, everybody is happier with the better service. It is win, win, win. But we have got to understand that for the big deal that it is, and connect those little ACOs to this big $ trillion, and fix the mess that our health care system is right now, and I hope that we will work together on that also. Ms. Young. Absolutely, sir, and the bill you are considering this week does have some improvements, some increased subsidies for ACA. Hopefully can get more people in it, and I think there is a lot more to do on the ACA front to ensure that that graph continues to get bigger. Senator Whitehouse. Yeah. We can spread that actually further with more work that is good stuff. Thanks, Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Senator Warner. Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Ms. Young, it is good to see you, at least virtually. I think you have been very impressive in your answers. I do want to say, though, that I know some of my colleagues on the Republican side have made the decision about Neera Tanden. I hope some will still reconsider. I look forward to supporting you, Ms. Young, but hope is still that, at least initially, I will be supporting you for Deputy Director. I want to get to three quick questions. One, Virginia is home to about , Federal workers. They have been under enormous assault under the Trump administration as the previous administration tried to politicize the workforce. I saw it particularly in my role in the Intel Committee what has happened to our intel workforce. And while I was heartened by the Biden administration's initial actions to repeal the Schedule F Executive order that Trump tried to put in in the waning days of his administration, from bargaining rights to pay to just general morale, the Federal workforce has been hurting. Layered on top of that, obviously, all the additional constraints with COVID. Can you speak on how you could coordinate with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to deal with this overriding issue of moral in the Federal workforce? Ms. Young. Senator, I pause because I started my career as a civil servant at National Institutes of Health (NIH). I understand how much more this country has benefitted by having a motivated Federal workforce, who shows up every day, does over and beyond. They could be in private industry, a lot of them, making more than they do in their government service. So it is not about a job for the Federal workers that I have known and worked with. It is about service. So that is one of the things I hope, if confirmed as Deputy Director, certainly within OMB, is to empower and bring a lot of that back to the career staff. I know that is a goal of mine, I hope to leave, during my time of service, is to let them know that we appreciate their service, we trust that they are good stewards of Federal policy, and you certainly have my commitment--some will need congressional fixes, congressional pardoners--to work with you to make sure that our Federal workers are getting the benefits necessary. Often in these budget deals that come up one of the main losers are Federal workers. We tend to cut their retirement. We tend to do things that do not, I think, do a lot for morale. So you certainly have my commitment to work with you to bring back, I think, some of the things that have eroded over the last few years. Senator Warner. Well, I would look forward to working with you on that. I had that issue over my years here, something started by Ted Kaufman when he served as a Senator from Delaware, going down on the floor of the Senate, calling out the great contribution of Federal workers on an individualized basis. Your work at NIH, you know, as you said, a lot of these workers could be making a lot more. This was a piece of public service and it is going to be great working with a partner who supports that service. Kind of related to that, one of the areas that the Chairman has been a big advocate, and I have generally been supportive of during the period of COVID, trying to help workers with increased unemployment benefits and trying to make sure we cover a whole group of folks, for example, gig workers and others I think is a very positive action. One of the things that we have had some debate on is whether the economy includes some of that additional benefits cut back. And we have had, I think, a good debate on this issue, but the challenge has been, to be able to do that, we have got to upgrade our IT systems within the Federal Government. Now, literally, we could not even put in place economic stabilizers in a rational way because our IT system is so bad. We have dramatically underinvested, not just under Trump but candidly even under President Obama. There is something called the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF). I hope you will [inaudible] legislation that I have got. I know President Biden put forward a $ billion investment and unfortunately it got cut back in the House to $ billion. In your last two seconds, can you talk to upgrading our technology? Ms. Young. Yes. You heard it through several Senators' questions that, you know, it is central to many issues we have with payments to individuals, with ensuring our financial audits, a lot of it comes back down to technology, and you certainly have my commitment to work with you. I am very familiar with the TMF, making sure we get investments there. Senator Warner. Thank you, Ms. Young. I look forward to supporting you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Warner. Senator Merkley. Senator Merkley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Ms. Young, I just want to jump right into questions since we do not have a lot of time. We had the situation in previous administrations where OIRA, part of OMB, has proceeded to be a place where rules go and disappear, and never to be seen again, or to sit untended for years. Things like mercury air toxics rule, rearview cameras in cars, the issue of a rule related to coal ash. We have the vaping rule, which we had all these illegal products on the market and nothing happened, and millions of American youth became addicted to vaping, a situation very hard to reverse which will affect health care costs and the quality of life for millions of Americans for generations to come. And so how do you feel about this section of OIRA becoming just this place where regulations go to suffer and die with no transparency about what is happening? Ms. Young. Senator, it is certainly not the statutory goal of OIRA and something we should not strive to have that opinion of OIRA. I do believe we can use the presidential memo calling for OMB to lead an effort to improve and modernize, to do something about that perception, and work with our partners in Congress to make sure that we fix this issue. Senator Merkley. Thank you, and I look forward to talking with you when we end up with challenges of disappearing regulations in OIRA in the future. I want to turn then to the cost benefit analysis that you referred to before, and the decision to keep it in place. Often that cost benefit analysis does not capture externalities, and certainly not the social cost of carbon. Can you speak to how OMB's cost benefit analysis can reflect the true cost of decarbonization or the true advantages of decarbonization? Ms. Young. Senator, I think you are speaking to the very core of the presidential memo that we have talked a lot about, on improving and modernizing. I think it is good to keep a basic set of facts, a cost benefit, but you are absolutely right. You see it in carbon, and actually not just carbon, in greenhouse gases, you see it in regulations that have to do with servicing people who might be from rural America or living with disabilities, that often looking just at costs and benefits is not enough to understand the full impact. If our goal is to improve the lives of all Americans, I think we have to, even if it is difficult, find a way to quantify these things, because as you mentioned and as Senator Whitehouse has mentioned, climate change is an economics issue as much as anything. Senator Merkley. Does that mean that the OMB cost benefit analysis will now incorporate the social cost of carbon? Ms. Young. I think, Senator, you have seen administrative action. I am not there yet, but if confirmed I am happy to get back to you on the details. I cannot speak about every single action that has occurred, since I am not there, but my understanding on the social cost of greenhouse gases, with carbon being one part of that, there are working groups that have reformed, that have been done away with in order to help quantify that cost. Senator Merkley. Thank you, Ms. Young. President Biden, in a related issue, has committed to directing percent of green Federal investments towards environmental justice communities, necessitating a sort of equity screen and recognizing that low- income communities are often hit particularly hard by environmental effects. But that has to be tracked. Do you see OMB as having a role in tracking and targeting those investments to address that percent goal? Ms. Young. OMB will be a part of that process, as stated in the President's Executive order on climate change. There is a specific section dealing exclusively with environmental justice and it lays out the members of the council that will deal with those issues, and OMB will be a part of that. Senator Merkley. Thank you. And finally, how do you envision OMB working to drive solutions to the student debt crisis in our country? Ms. Young. I have to imagine OMB will be central to offering ideas and legislative solutions. I do know that it will take a partner in Congress to ensure we deal with that issue. You do not normally like breakups, but one of my breakups has been with Navient, myself, years ago. It is crushing, the student loan debt, and I am one of the lucky ones. Senator Merkley. I am sorry. I missed that. Your own personal loan? Ms. Young. My own personal loans. It was one of the best breakups I have ever had, was to pay the last payment to Navient, and again, that was years after I started college, and I am one of the lucky ones. Senator Merkley. Well, congratulations. I hope you had a big party at that moment, and I do hope that OMB will work in partnership with the administration on the cancellation of loan debt. I support the broader goal of $ , . It would be incredible stimulus and an opportunity for so many to escape this deep burden that other developing countries do not impose on their aspiring students. But even at the lower level of $ , , it is one thing to have it as a vision and it is another to actually make it happen, and I hope OMB can help with that. Ms. Young. Thank you. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Senator Merkley. Senator Braun. Senator Braun. Thank you, Chairman Sanders. Good to be here discussing something, Ms. Young, that to me--I have been here a couple of years, and I know you have been in the House part of Appropriations. I have run an enterprise that has had to really be worried about what lies down the road. In other words, how do you get things to work out financially? I see a trajectory that we are on that just, to me, looks unsustainable, and whether you believe in the modern monetary theory. With what you crafted, being involved in appropriations, where we are at currently, where we have got structural, trillion-dollar deficits. We have got a balance sheet that, I do not care how good you are as a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), would be something you could not be proud of. Here, it is different. You know, we are lucky that we are in a place where we can borrow for nearly zero. That changes as soon as we are not the reserve currency. You have got an impending crisis with the Medicare trust fund being completely depleted here in a little over years. We have been paying into it, employers and employees, since the ' s. It is social security that is even more ominous in terms of what would happen if you let it continue on the trajectory. Tell me a little bit about how you think, for anyone here, especially that looks to the Federal Government as a place that you want to do more with, how do you keep it in a healthy place going from here forward, and what do you think your input has been towards being an appropriator, that, to me, looks like no one really cares about how this is going to work out for future generations. Ms. Young. Senator Braun, you know, I perfectly acknowledge long-term debt has to be addressed. It is probably only going to be addressed with bipartisan solutions. But I do have to turn to, you know, people smarter than me, and I would certainly listen to Secretary Yellen, who tells us we will be on a worse economic trajectory if we do not do something--not just do something--if we do not ensure the health of American citizens and then turn our full sights to ensuring investments for our economic recovery. At some point we are going to have to turn to long-term, but I do not think we have ever faced anything like this pandemic before. So I certainly agree with you, but I do think there is still room, as you mentioned. It is very cheap to borrow right now, which is something I think we also have to look at when we are looking at the response to the pandemic. Senator Braun. So normally when you borrow money you do it for something that is a tangible asset, an investment, only borrow to invest, never borrow to spend or consume. Of course, we consume everything here. I think that is another thing to think about. Let me ask you, on the revenue side of the ledger. Everybody is really good at spending here. I have had conversations with folks on the Budget Committee. Can you raise revenue? Do you think it is realistic that you can bridge the structural deficit gap with that, and how would you consider doing that? And can you do that in a meaningful way before you start to throttle back economic growth, and also, looking at maybe what was in place pre-COVID to whereas somebody off the street, I thought we had it pretty well hitting the mark. We helped small businesses through the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, C- corps got probably way too big a break that they did not need. What do you think about the revenue side, that no one wants to talk about? Ms. Young. Senator Braun, I mean, I am sure you already know this. President Biden has looked to increasing the tax rate for those over $ , , and for some corporations who, I think, some of the lessons from the tax break did not do as much investing in their personnel as was hoped or touted before that act. So I do think there is some room, on the revenue side, to help out long-term debt. I do think there are some other things besides revenue and spending. Senator Whitehouse talked about the cost of health care. We have got to do something so the government is not paying nearly as much for health care and neither are private citizens. So I think there will have to be a multi-pronged view of how we do this, but, you know, we cannot cut benefits for people that have paid into them. I have my parents here. You know, they are called entitlements for a reason. People have paid their entire careers in their lives for these benefits, and part of that is ensuring that health care does not cost what it costs to provide it to the American people. Senator Braun. Well, thank you, and I think that is a bit of realism, and it is going to take some really hard decisions that, in my observation, do not happen often here, along the lines of having some political will to make those tough decisions if we are going to have it sustainable in the long run. Ms. Young. Thank you, sir. Senator Braun. Thank you. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Braun. Senator Kaine. Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks, Ms. Young. Congratulations to you. I intend to support you, and you have had a distinguished public service career. Two editorial comments and two questions. One editorial comment, I am not sure you should need Senate confirmation. I think if President Biden wants to hire you to be Deputy Director I think he should be able to hire you. I am in my ninth year in the Senate, third President, and an observation about the Senate is I think we have too many Senate-confirmable positions, and each one chews up some Committee time and then chews up some floor time. And by chewing up finite time then legislative time gets shrunk. So I might start urging that on my colleagues. I would love to have you here to ask you tons of questions, but I do not necessarily think that Deputy Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy Directors of agencies should need Senate confirmation. That is editorial comment number one. Number two, Neera Tanden. The controversy about Neera is largely over her social media comments, which could be levied at virtually all of us. I mean, it is partly a challenge for the individual, and she has got to own that, and she has apologized for it, and it is partly the world we live in, where we say things in the heat of the moment and social media gives us the ability to do it. My editorial comment is this. We faced so many nominees in the past administration who had really intemperate things to say in social media accounts, including about me, but they apologized. And when they apologized their apologies were accepted by virtually all Republicans and a lot of Democrats. So Neera Tanden has apologized, and I just worry that there is a double standard with her that why would we accept the apologies of others, about comments on social media, that, if anything, were more extreme, and not accept Neera Tanden's apologies? And I am nervous about that, and I ask that question not just to Republicans. I ask it to Democrats. Two questions. Ms. Young. And, Senator Kaine, I know you were speaking, but I have not had the chance to weigh in on this question. I certainly think before this Committee you saw Neera Tanden apologize profusely about the tweets. I think what you also saw is an expansive knowledge of various policy areas. And certainly I have gotten to know Neera over the last few weeks. We did not have much interactions before then, and I do think we both bring some skill sets in different areas where we make a great team, if both of us were confirmed. So thank you for those comments and I hope if you listen to her time before this Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), she really did lay out her vast policy experience. Senator Kaine. I completely agree with you. Now, on to the two questions. One of the things about your nomination that makes me the happiest is that you have years' experience working in the Article I branch. The OMB, in the previous administration, treated us like we were an annoyance on a good day, or an enemy on a bad day, and there were more bad days than good days. And they particularly treated those in the minority party, the Democrats in that administration, as the enemy. I am not sure they were that good to the majority party either. So, for example, with issues like congressional requests for information, you will take an oath, should you be confirmed, to the Constitution of the United States, not to the President. Can I have your assurance--and you have already been asked this by Senator Sanders, but I want to have your assurance on this. Will you treat, as somebody who has sat on the congressional side of this dais, will you treat requests from Senators on this Committee, be they Democratic or Republican, with respect, and try to be as responsive as you can, as promptly as you can? Ms. Young. I cannot answer that more emphatically. Yes, and you are absolutely right. I have heard from Republican members as well who not only could not get information but would see their things important to them go to OMB to never be seen again. Senator Kaine. And if you have a problem, or anybody at OMB, with committee members just like pestering you so you cannot do your work, you can take that to the Chairman and the Chairman can be an enforcer and tell us to knock it off. But reasonable requests should be dealt with in a prompt fashion, whether they are made by Republicans or Democrats. I am glad to hear you agree with that, and I knew you would. Second question. So I came into the Senate in January of . Sequestration and budget caps went into effect in late February. We had a -week government shutdown in October. We have had endless CRs. We had a month-long shutdown of a portion of the U.S. Government in late ' and . I have an opinion about how I would grade the Federal budget process since I have been here. If I was asking you to grade the Federal budget process, what grade would you give it? Ms. Young. Wow, that is a tough one, on the process. Senator Kaine. Well, not the process, not the process as in the statute, but grade our performance. Ms. Young. Okay. Get away from the process---- Senator Kaine. Rate our performance. Ms. Young. --which is often ugly. When we finish I will give it an A, because we got there, and I think there is a lot of value in that. Senator Kaine. I am just going to say, I would not give it an A, and I would love an acknowledgment that there should be some significant improvement. That is not going to affect my vote. Ms. Young. There has to be improvement, Senator. I still find a lot of intrinsic value in working through an annual process, and you and I talked about this, as someone who loves this institution. And I have told you this personally, my concern would be if anything would keep Congress from doing that bare-knuckle negotiations, where you got to hold the Executive branch accountable each year. So yes, it needs improvement, but I would hate to see anything that required less congressional action because of that. Senator Kaine. Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Kaine. Senator Van Hollen. Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, and I was pleased with Neera Tanden's nomination to be Director of OMB, and I am very pleased with yours to be the Deputy Director. Congratulations. And I want to pick up a little bit on the process, but especially the part of the process that has been broken, at least over the last years. And as the staff director of the House Appropriations Committee you were deeply involved in addressing the illegal withholding of funds by OMB during the last administration, the most prominent case involved withholding security assistance for Ukraine. And I asked at the time that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the nonpartisan GAO, review that matter and determine whether a withholding violated the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), which, as you know, is the law that is supposed to prevent the Executive branch, regardless of party, for unilaterally refusing to spend funds that are provided in laws passed by the Congress. GAO looked at it and confirmed that the Trump administration violated that law. As a member of this Committee, the Budget Committee, we were able to put together bipartisan legislation that included a provision I proposed to strengthen the Impoundment Control Act and increase transparency for the apportionment process at OMB. We have not yet passed that legislation. I would like to get your commitment to work with us to strengthen the laws that protect constitutional separation of powers and Congress' power of the purse. Having come from the Appropriations Committee I hope you will work us to do that. Ms. Young. Again, something near and dear to me, and you absolutely have my commitment to working on those. I know there are lots of efforts to strengthen the ICA, and I think also in my commitment to you I will also, you know, commit to working with GAO, who are the arbiters in these things, and they found wrongdoing, and I think we should listen to them when they make those, I think, very thoughtful judgments. Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that. Look, there is a process, and GAO has pointed out some things we can do to further strengthen that process. Obviously, the Executive branch has a role in budget consideration, but as you know, once Congress has spoken it is imperative that the administration, any administration, follow the law with respect to those decisions. I would like to just briefly ask you about the issue of long-term unemployment, because we are all hopeful that as we beat this pandemic and with the passage, I hope, of the emergency bill, that we expect to pass before the middle of this month, that the economy will begin to improve. And we hope to see steady improvement, more people going back to work. But I am very worried about individuals who are long-term unemployed. We have over million long-term unemployed Americans right now. These are individuals who have been out of work for more than months, looking for work. On top of that we have over million Americans who have essentially dropped out of the workforce, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Powell, in response to a question I asked him the other day, indicated that we are going to have to be very intentional about policies to help the long-term unemployed. Even before the pandemic, when the economy was working better, we had over million Americans who were long-term unemployed. I do not expect you to commit to any details, but just would you agree that the issue of long-term unemployment is one that we have to address with intentionality, meaning we cannot just expect that as the economy improves that the long-term unemployed will automatically find work, because we know that has not been true in the past. Ms. Young. Senator Van Hollen, thank you for bringing this up. I think one of the goals of government is to ensure that those who are easily left behind, that we ensure that they are not. So I look forward to working with you on this. Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate it. These are individuals who want to work, they are out there looking for jobs, and really through no fault of their own unable to find it. And it hurts them, and, of course, it hurts the larger community when we are not able to take advantage of their skills in growing the economy. So thank you, and, Mr. Chairman, thank you. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Senator Van Hollen. Senator Padilla. Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Young, for your willingness to serve. I know in a prior hear for the Director of OMB position I was able to ask questions generally in regards to concern about equity and the role OMB can play in policymaking and budgeting to address equity challenges in America. We also touched on the economic contributions of immigrants over the course of our nation's history. I know earlier in this hearing we have heard a lot of questions about a number of issues, from climate to COVID response and everything in between. I say all that because I want to raise a couple of issues that are unique, important not just to California, my home State, but the nation as a whole, so let me jump into it. The first of the two is housing and homelessness. The COVID- pandemic has exacerbated our nation's ongoing affordable housing and homelessness crises. Nearly in renters across the country, including an estimated million Californians alone, have been unable to catch up on their rent. Even before the pandemic, a lack of affordable housing and rising rents pushed too many into our societal safety net and even into homelessness, with now more than , individuals experiencing homelessness in California, which could get worse, with evictions related to our recent economic downturn. So as we look to build back better, will you commit to ensuring that the President's budget requests seek significant increases for critical housing programs such as Committee Development Block Grant Program, the Home Investment Partnership Program, homelessness assistance grants, and expanded Section vouchers? And I welcome any other recommendations or suggestions you have in this regard. Ms. Young. Senator, I certainly do commit--I am not there yet so I have not been involved in the budget development. But those are programs I have supported during my time as staff director of the Appropriations Committee, so I certainly will look to work with you to make sure that there is adequate funding in not just the annual programs but I do believe there is still work to be done as we recover from COVID, and possible other legislation. Senator Padilla. Thank you for that. I look forward to following up with you in the weeks, months, and years ahead. The second area--again, I think to issues that have been raised already--is relative to scientific research fundings. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the only agency that funds basic nonbiomedical research, as you know. The potentially groundbreaking projects that the NSF supports drive economic growth and spur transformative discoveries that are critical to our lives. Over the past several decades, these breakthroughs have included accelerated supercomputing, bar codes, improving tumor detection, and even the shaping of the internet as we know it today. Today the NSF is funding projects to better understand the inner working of living cells, forecast and predict earthquakes and tsunamis, advance clean energy technologies, and more. Now while Congress has approved funding increase to NSF's medical counterpart, the National Institutes of Health, NSF funding has not kept pace. So as we act to reverse the denigration of science and scientists that we have seen over the last years, it is critical, in my opinion, that we also support scientists and scientific research with the additional funding that they need. So as you work to develop the President's budget request for fiscal year , will you consider prioritizing new investments in scientific research, including increased funding for the National Science Foundation? And part two of the question is, will you also work to uphold the integrity of science as well as support scientist at Federal agencies and research institutions throughout the nation? Ms. Young. I started my career at NIH. I am certainly aware the attention NIH gets from bipartisan members, but its sisters in science, NSF, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), all deserve the same level of support. NSF does great work, supports great work among universities. So you certainly have my commitment to ensuring that I would lead my voice to those who want to prioritize NSF. And we certainly have seen a need for that increased basic research during COVID, not just at NIH but NSF as well. Senator Padilla. As one of the few engineers and scientists serving in this body I thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Padilla. I want to thank Ms. Young for appearing before the Committee today. Ms. Young, your full statement will be included in the record. As information for all Senators, questions for the record are due by noon tomorrow, with signed hard copies delivered to the Committee clerk in Dirksen . Emailed copies will also be accepted, due to our current conditions, under our rules. Ms. Young will have days from receipt of our questions to respond with answers. With no further business---- Senator Whitehouse. Mr. Chairman, may I make one last comment before we close out? Chairman Sanders. Very briefly. Senator Whitehouse. Very briefly. I just had an exchange with Director Wray about the FBI's consistent refusal to answer questions from Congress through the Trump administration. In nine different committee hearings, seven got zero Questions for the Record (QFR) answered. Zero. And what he blamed it on was the interagency process that all have to go through, which OMB runs. So we need to clean that mess up. I think that is a phony, basically, but we need to clean that mess up. Ms. Young. On the Appropriations Committee we can barely produce hearing volumes for lack of QFRs, so you certainly have my commitment that we need to do better. Chairman Sanders. Okay. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Under our rules, Ms. Young will have days from receipt of our questions to respond with answers. With no further business before the Committee, this hearing is adjourned. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the Committee was adjourned.] ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD [Prepared statement, responses to written questions, and additional material supplied for the record follow:] Prepared Statement of Ms. Shalanda D. Young [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] EXECUTIVE BUSINESS MEETING TO CONSIDER THE NOMINATION OF MS. SHALANDA D. YOUNG, OF LOUISIANA, TO BE DEPUTY DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ---------- WEDNESDAY, MARCH , U.S. Senate, Committee on the Budget, Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at : p.m., in Room S- , The Capitol, Hon. Bernard Sanders, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Sanders, Murray, Wyden, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Warner, Merkley, Kaine, Van Hollen, Lujan, Padilla, Graham, Grassley, Crapo, Toomey, Johnson, Braun, Sasse, and Romney. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BERNARD SANDERS Chairman Sanders. Okay, ladies and gentlemen. I call the Committee meeting to order. The question before the Committee is the nomination of Shalanda Young to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The past years, Ms. Young has served as a top staffer on the House Appropriations Committee and has done an excellent job working with Democrats and Republicans on legislation that must be passed each and every year that impacts the lives of tens of millions of Americans. There is no doubt that she is highly qualified for this position and I strongly support her nomination. Senator Graham, would you like to make a speech on this issue? OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM Senator Graham. Yes, it will take or minutes. The bottom line is Senator Shelby tells me she has been great to work with on budget matters and appropriations. But the statement that she gave in response to Senator Hawley's question about the Hyde Amendment is troubling to many of our members. So I am going to vote yes with the understanding she has to answer one additional question. She said in her statement that she would follow the law. I think every regulation in the country comes across her desk and I want her to assure me that if there is a regulation proposed by the Biden administration that changes Hyde or chips away at it that the statutory provisions prevail. So I am going to vote yes, Mr. Chairman, with that understanding. And if she does not give the right answer, I am going to change my vote. Chairman Sanders. Okay. Do we have a quorum present? I think we do. I note that a quorum is present and urge a yes vote on this nomination. We will vote that the Committee report the nomination to the Senate with a recommendation that the nominee be confirmed. The clerk will call the roll. The Clerk. Ms. Murray. Senator Murray. Aye.

COMBATING TERRORISM: ASSESSING THE THREAT OF A BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS ATTACK ---------- FRIDAY, OCTOBER , House of Representatives, Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs and International Relations, Committee on Government Reform, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at a.m., in room , Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Christopher Shays (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Shays, Putnam, Gilman, Platts, Allen, Schakowsky, and Clay. Staff present: Lawrence J. Halloran, staff director and counsel; R. Nicholas Palarino, senior policy advisor; Thomas Costa, professional staff member; Jason M. Chung, clerk; David Rapallo, minority counsel; and Earley Green, minority assistant clerk. Mr. Shays. I would like to call this hearing to order and welcome our panel and our guests. Before September , assessing the threat of biological terrorism was disdained by some as little more than an academic or a bureaucratic exercise. Today, as we worry about access to crop dusters and suspicious anthrax exposures in Florida, a clear-eyed, a fully informed view of the threat imposed by weaponized pathogens is a national security imperative. But we still have no comprehensive threat assessment and achieving that essential perspective remains a challenge. Assessing the threat of bioterrorism requires a sober judgment about the motivations, intentions and capabilities of people so intoxicated with hate and evil, they would kill themselves in the act of killing others. The questions that confound the assessment process, when and where will terrorists use biological weapons against us, how will the agent be disbursed, for what type and magnitude of attack should we be prepared. Available answers offer little comfort and less certainty in assessing the threat. Some conclude the technical difficulties of large scale production and efficient dissemination reduce the likelihood terrorists will use lethal agents to inflict mass casualties anytime soon. Others think those barriers have been or will soon be overcome. Still others believe that neither large quantities nor wide dispersions are required to inflict biological terror. From this cacophony of plausible opinions, those charged with formulating a national counterterrorism strategy must glean a rational estimate about the irrational possibility of biological attack. Perhaps the most difficult dimension of the threat to assess is the deep-seated, almost primal fear engendered by the prospect of maliciously induced disease. For the terrorists, that fear is a potent force multiplier capable of magnifying a minor manageable outbreak into a major public crisis. Failure to account for this unique aspect of biological terrorism understates the threat, increasing our vulnerability. Overstating the threat based on fear alone invites overreaction in which we waste scarce resources and terrorize ourselves with Draconian security restrictions. If you live in a flood plane, you plan for the -year or even - year flood. You don't expect every flood to reach the -year level. If the least likely but worst case scenario dominates your planning, you would spend every day sitting on the roof in a raincoat waiting for the catastrophic deluge. Instead, accepting some risk, you would prudently assess the likelihood of storm surge, buy an extra case of water and some flashlights and go on about your life. After September , we all live in a bio-terrorism flood plain and we should plan accordingly. A workable assessment of the biological threat demands an open discussion of risks, vulnerabilities and fears. It is that discussion we continue today. It is the discussion we will have again October , when Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and others will appear before the subcommittee to discuss the role of vaccines in our near term and long-term preparedness against biological attack. We truly welcome our witnesses and thank them for sharing their time, their expertise and their opinions with us today. At this time, I think we will recognize our senior and most experienced member, the gentleman from New York. You have the floor. Mr. Gilman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank you for holding today's hearing to examine the overall threat posed by biological terrorism and the steps needed to be taken by our government to establish an effective response to a biological weapons attack. But I want to commend you, too, for your continual efforts to try to prepare our government for all kinds of emergencies that we may be experiencing as a result of terrorism. Your recent meeting yesterday where we shared thoughts with some of our experts on anti-terrorism, an informal meeting, but a highly experienced group that was giving us some thoughts that we shared together; the fractionalization hearing on our Government's efforts spread through so many of our agencies; lack of threat assessment; the need for force protection; domestic preparedness; detection technology; hearings on anthrax, chemical warfare. You ought to be commended for this extremely intensive review of our government's programs to prepare our Nation better for these kinds of problems. And I don't think we can commend you enough for your continual efforts in this area. For many years, the possibility of a biological terrorist attack occurring in our Nation seemed absurd, something to be relegated to the realm of science fiction. Regrettably, the barbaric events of September th, have sharply focused our national attention on terrorism and have underscored our vulnerability to future attacks. Indeed, the bioterrorism debate has been transformed from a question of if to the seeming inevitably of when and how. The task of developing an overall strategy to successfully counteract any domestic act of biological terrorism has proven to be a difficult challenge for our Federal and State policymakers. Yet, there can be no doubt that there is now a sense of urgency for the resolution of this task that was not critical before this. Biological terrorism is now at the fore of our national agenda. There has been a great deal of debate in recent years about the nature of the biological terror, both in terms of where the threat originates, what specific agents pose the greatest danger. So far, the media has focused its attention on anthrax and smallpox, yet those represent merely two of the many agents which conceivably could be utilized by terrorists in any future attack. Since September th, we have been engaged in a war on terrorism. The President has told us it is going to be a long, protracted struggle which we all recognize; the very real potential of additional attacks on our own soil. The FBI just yesterday warned us of the possibility of an imminent attack. Given that, it is in our interest to place greater effort on identifying both the capability of those who are likely to use biological weapons against us as well as to be able to develop effective counterterrorism measures and responses to any future attack. I look forward, along with my colleagues, to the testimony that we are going to hear from our distinguished panel of witnesses, and I am certain that their experience and insight will prove helpful to us and to this committee as Congress works to find its role in this suddenly urgent and vexing issues. So once again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your outstanding leadership on these important topics. And I hope you will continue in that vein. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Thank you, Mr. Chairman yourself. And I would say whatever compliments go to the staff. We have an excellent staff on this committee. At this time, I would recognize the vice-chairman of the committee, Adam Putnam and see if he has any statement. Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your continued leadership on this issue. As everyone in this room knows, this subcommittee has held more hearings on the threats from terrorism, including chemical and biological weapons, more than any other committee in the Congress, and we appreciate your continued leadership and look forward to the testimony from this panel. Mr. Shays. Thank the gentleman. Mr. Platts. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just echo the comments of my colleagues and our appreciation for your leadership in holding these very important hearings and to convey my sincere thanks to our witnesses here today, to share your expertise on a critically important issue and at a very relevant time in our Nation's struggles against threats from others. So thank you for being here. Mr. Shays. Before I recognize the witnesses, I just want to thank the members of this committee for being strong and active participants. Just recognizing our witnesses and then I will swear you all in and we will take your testimony. We have Raymond Decker, Director of Defense Capabilities Management Team, U.S. General Accounting Office. He is going to talk about threat and risk assessment and how it is done, more or less. We will have Ken Alibek, who is the former deputy head of the Soviet Union bioweapons program and an author of Biohazard and president of Advanced Biosystems, Inc. John Parachini, a policy analyst for RAND Corp., biological threat and terrorist groups. I think you will be addressing that issue and others. Gerald Post, professor of psychiatry, political psychology and international affairs, George Washington University, who will share with us the motivation of terrorists. And it is my understanding, Dr. Post, that you have probably interviewed more terrorists than most anyone else. We have an excellent panel. Just truly an excellent panel. I would like to invite you all to stand and swear you in. We swear in all our panelists. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Shays. Everyone has responded in the affirmative. Thank you very much and have a seat. I am going to ask unanimous consent that all members of the subcommittee be permitted to place an opening statement in the record and the record remain open for days for that purpose. Without objection, so ordered. I ask further unanimous consent that all witnesses be permitted to include their written statement in the record. Without objection, so ordered. We are going to go in the order that I called you. And let me say on the outset that I am very appreciative of the fine work that the General Accounting Office does. And I am also grateful, Mr. Decker, that you don't say you need to have a separate panel and that you are willing to participate in a larger panel. Maybe that doesn't seem unusual to you, but some in the government like to have their own panel. So I want to put on the record, thank you. It makes it easier for us to have a dialog. So you're on, Mr. Decker. STATEMENTS OF RAYMOND DECKER, DIRECTOR, DEFENSE CAPABILITIES MANAGEMENT TEAM, U.S. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE; KEN ALIBEK, PRESIDENT, ADVANCED BIOSYSTEMS, INC.; JOHN PARACHINI, POLICY ANALYST, RAND CORP.; AND JERROLD POST, M.D., PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY, POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY Mr. Decker. Chairman Shays and members of the subcommittee, I am pleased to be here this morning to discuss the issue of combating terrorism and an approach for managing the risk from terrorism directed at our homeland. Over the past several years, we have examined and reported on Federal efforts to combat terrorism to include weapons of mass destruction at the request of this committee and others. Our body of work includes over products, based on information gleaned from a range of sources to include Federal, State and local governments, foreign governments and private entities. The events of last month and the long-term aspects of the national engagement to combat terrorism highlight the need for effective near and long-term actions at all levels of government as well as in the private sector. The designation of a focal point within the Executive Office of the President to lead the Office of Homeland Security is a positive step. As Governor Ridge begins to craft a national strategy to effectively prepare the Nation from future attacks, we believe a risk management approach is essential to underpin decisions which identify requirements, set priorities, direct actions and allocate resources. A risk management is a balanced systematic and analytical process to evaluate the likelihood that a threat will endanger an asset and identify actions to reduce the risk and mitigate the consequences of an attack. We believe a good risk management approach should have three key elements, threat assessments, vulnerability assessments and criticality assessments. Allow me to briefly discuss each assessment. A threat assessment is an important process that identifies and evaluates threats using various factors such as capability, intention, past activity and potential lethality of attacks. At the national level, the Central Intelligence Agency and other agencies of the intelligence community are responsible for those assessments that involve international terrorist threats. The Federal Bureau of Investigation gathers information and assesses the threat posed by domestic sources of terrorism. In , and again, in our most recent report on combating terrorism, which was released last month--and this is A , we had recommended that the FBI prepare a formal intelligence assessment that assesses the chemical and biological agents that could be used by domestic terrorists without the assistance or support of a foreign entity. The FBI concurred and expects to complete the assessment in December of this year. Additionally, we recommended that the FBI produce a national level threat assessment using intelligence estimates and input from the intelligence community and others to form the basis for and to prioritize programs developed to combat terrorism to include weapons of mass destruction. Again, the FBI concurred and expects to complete this classified study later this month. Mr. Chairman, as you know, in April , we released a report on how other countries, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Israel are organized to combat terrorism. And we noted that these five countries place great emphasis on threat assessments which address the likelihood of attack. Since they stress their primary objective is prevention, these assessments have a significant importance in their planning and a response depending events. However, I must caution that since all attacks may not be prevented, the following two assessments are essential in preparation. A vulnerability assessment identifies weaknesses in physical structures, security systems, plans, procedures and a variety of other areas that could be exploited by terrorists. For example, a common physical vulnerability might be the close proximity of a parking area near a building or structure with the obvious concern being a vehicle laden with explosives. Normally, a multi-disciplinary team of experts in engineering, security, information systems, health and other areas normally would conduct this vulnerability assessment. Teams within an organization can perform these assessments, which is the case used by the Department of Defense. In a report, GAO report, we noted that a major U.S. multinational firm used the same approach to better focus its efforts in overseas facilities. The final assessment is the criticality assessment, and these are designed to identify which assets are most important to an organization's mission or represent a significant target which merit enhanced protection. For example, nuclear power plants, key bridges, major computer networks might be identified as critical assets based on national security or economic importance. Some facilities might be critical at certain times and not at other times. For example, sports stadiums or a shopping center filled with people might represent a critical asset. Typically, the affected organization would perform its own criticality assessment. And we note that the report of the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in the U.S. seaports issued late last year, stress the need for these assessments in conjunction with threat and vulnerability assessments. Mr. Chairman, simply stated, one must know as much as possible about threat, identify one's weaknesses to potential attack and determine which assets are most important and require special attention in order to make sound decisions on preparedness while leveraging limited resources. I have one caveat about threat assessments. Our national goal is to understand the threat and create assessments to guide our actions. To this end, there are continuous efforts by the intelligence and law enforcement communities to assess foreign and domestic threats to the Nation. However, even with these efforts, we may never have enough information on all threats. So there may be a tendency to use worst-case scenarios in this situation. Since worst-case scenarios focus on vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities are almost unlimited and would require exhaustive resources, we believe it is essential that a careful balance exist using all three assessment elements in preparing and protecting against threats. In summary, threat, vulnerability and criticality assessments, when completed and evaluated together in a risk management-based approach, will allow leaders and managers to make key decisions which will better prepare against potential terrorist attacks that may include weapons of mass destruction. If this risk management approach were adopted throughout the Federal Government and by other segments of society, we believe a more effective and efficient preparation in-depth against acts of terrorism directed at our homeland could be affected. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement and I will be pleased to respond to any questions that the committee may have. Mr. Shays. Thank you, Mr. Decker. It is a very helpful statement. And we will definitely have questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Decker follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Shays. Dr. Alibek. Mr. Alibek. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank very much for inviting me here. And I think my -year long experience in the field of biological weapons and biological weapons defense make me, I hope, at least, experience gives me some right to discuss this issue. Before I came to the United States in , I was scientific leader of this program in the former Soviet Union. I was responsible for a large number of scientists and technicians involved in this program. Mr. Shays. The rumor is it was , . Mr. Alibek. , people and about facilities involved in research and development of biological weapons and research and development in defense against biological weapons. And we were on both sides to develop weapons and to develop defense. And now we know in this country, in the United States, we have a great deal of confusion when we discuss biological weapons and biological weapon threat. Some experts discuss and say biological weapons present very significant threat. Some people say no, it is not a threat whatsoever. In my opinion, makes us as disarmed and we don't pay much attention to necessity to the structure of biological weapons defense. The problem is this: We discuss in many cases--we discuss anthrax. We discuss smallpox. We discuss some ways to analyze biological weapons and whether or not it is difficult. But the problem is this: This issue is much wider and bigger because when we discuss biological weapons, what we need to keep in mind are several dozen biological agents could be used in biological weapons. There are many deployment techniques. And these techniques are not just aerosol deployment. There are many others. It is not a situation where someone has to develop a very sophisticated device to deploy biological weapons. These techniques could be, I would say, used with very primitive devices. And, you know, many such things, in my opinion, make biological weapons very dangerous, and very effective weapons could be used. And some people ask why biological weapons? What is the difference between biological weapons, nuclear weapons or regular conventional weapons? In my opinion, biological weapons have a very significant attractiveness because of many reasons. As I said before, a number of different agents could be used; many, many different techniques. And the great diversity of biological weapons make them effective weapons. And what is important to keep in mind, biological weapons impose infectious diseases, and each biological weapon could result in absolutely different consequences. I provided, with some examples, for example, smallpox, anthrax, plague and Marburg infections. And what I would like to say it's just a small number of examples, but if you analyze all these agents and weapons, you could see how diversified these weapons are. And unfortunately, our understanding of biological weapons is not, I would say, comprehensive enough. What we need to do now, we need to rectify our understanding and knowledge of biological weapons. As soon as we start understanding what is a real threat to biological weapons, we start understanding what kind of defense we need to develop. The problem is this: If we still consider existing approaches in developing defense against biological weapons are perfect approaches, or plausible approaches, in my opinion, we make significant mistake. What I notice when we discuss this issue--when I read many testimonies or articles, we discuss antibiotics. We discuss vaccines. I have nothing against antibiotics. In many cases, they could protect against bacterial biological weapons. But when we discuss vaccines, there is a very important situation why we discuss vaccines. We discuss vaccines as a possible protection for troops or in some other scenarios. Vaccines are not good protection against--in the case of bioterrorism. And you know, when we discuss and assess to spend much money to develop vaccines, it causes a significant question. Why? Vaccine needs to be introduced well in advance first. You are not capable to vaccinate entire population. You have no idea against what agent you need to vaccinate people and so on and so forth. And there is another issue. Many vaccines have not developed yet. But we continue pushing this vaccine issue at the same time, you know, in my opinion, it shifts us toward wrong direction. What we need to keep in mind in the medical defense, there are three major areas: Prophylactics or prophylaxes we call it, urgent prophylactics and treatment. And, you know, when we spend our major resources to develop vaccines, we don't spend much time or resources to develop treatment and to develop urgent prophylaxes. In my opinion, it is a significant mistake that needs to be corrected. There is another issue--it is just one of the part of biological weapons. Mr. Shays. Say that last point over again--the last point. Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, when we discuss a necessity to develop new vaccines, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop new vaccines, we are making a very significant mistake because vaccines are not a good protection in bioterrorism. Now we have got many agencies, many departments involved in this business. We know that these agencies and these departments have many subcontractors working in this field. But you know when we try to understand what is the scope of the problem and what the scope of the work, for example, their agencies and departments do, in my opinion, it wouldn't be possible just to create more or less comprehensive and truthful picture. In my opinion, the problem is this: We still suffer lack of coordination between these agencies. And do you know if we don't realize there is time just to develop a completely new system, we should include, in my opinion, a necessity to establish a new agency, agency which would be responsible completely just to work in the field of biodefense. And this agency would have responsibility and would have overall authority and would be able just to manage and revise what is being done by any agency, by any department in the United States. In this case, this agency would be able to establish a system, I would say, highly centralized system to develop protection against biological weapons. The problem is this. We live in democratic country, but when we talk about national security issues or when you talk about bioterrorism and possible huge number of casualties, there is no democracy here. It must be highly centralized and very effective system. Thank you. Mr. Shays. Thank you, Dr. Alibek. [The prepared statement of Mr. Alibek follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Shays. We will now go to Mr. Parachini. Mr. Parachini. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the privilege and opportunity to testify here. Since the tragic events of September th, many Americans have become concerned about the prospect of biological terrorism. After all, it seems plausible that hijackers willing to kill themselves, those aboard commercial airliners and thousands more in the World Trade Center and Pentagon might be willing to use biological agents to kill indiscriminately. Yet it is important to maintain some perspective of the relative dangers. th century history of warfare, terrorism and crime involving biological agents is much less deadly than that of the history with conventional explosives. While history is not a perfect guide to the future, it does provide a context for our thinking about the future. We need to take account of history and hedge against the seeming imponderables of the future. When it comes to the feasibility of using biological weapons, States are more likely to have the resources, technical capabilities, organizational capacity to assemble the people, know-how, material and equipment to produce such weapons and to be able to clandestinely deliver them to valued targets. Mustering the resources and capabilities to inflict devastating strikes with biological agents has proved to be formidable tasks even for States. While some terrorist groups may attempt large scale biological attempts, perpetrating an attack on a scale as that of September th is not likely. At the moment, only States are able to perpetrate clandestinely biological attacks and they are extremely reluctant to do so. Limited attacks using biological agents as common as salmonella and as rare as anthrax are possible. But the scope and scale of such attacks will be modest. On balance, then, a State's ability to command resources and organize them for certain priorities scientific and industrial objectives presents the potential for the greatest threat in bioterrorism. What is more likely than a conscious decision by a country's command authority is that an unauthorized faction within a State might take it upon itself to use a subnational group to do its dirty group. The alleged involvement of the Iranian Government's security services in the attack on American military personnel in Khobart Towers seems to be an example of this type of involvement. When it comes to the feasibility of biological terrorism perpetrated by subnational groups and individuals, the range of capability and the level of consequence depends on whether the groups or individuals are State-sponsored or not. High consequence biological attacks would probably require the assistance of a State sponsor or some other source of considerable resources. Money, arms, logistical support training, even training on how to operate in a chemically contaminated environment, are all forms of assistance States have provided to terrorists. But historically, they have not crossed the threshold and provided biological weapons material to insurgency groups or terrorist organizations. Natural question at this time is whether an organization such as al Qaeda with the financial support of Osama bin Laden might be able to amass the resources for a significant biological attack. Think as we consider this possibility, we need to not only look at the opportunities, but the disincentives. Too often we envision what we fear and do not take into account the thinking of somebody else. We think they are thinking like we fear as opposed to how they are thinking. And I think the most important thing I would draw your attention to is that terrorists have readily turned to more available alternatives, explosives. And indeed, on September th, they took an ordinary means of modern transportation and turned it into an extraordinary killing device. The only two cases we have where terrorists have used biological weapons, one in , where it was a religious cult group, the Rajneeshee, and another years later by the Aum Shinrikyo. Neither of these inflicted the level of casualties that are regularly the product of conventional explosives. Both of these cases had unusual aspects to them and unusual aspects about their leadership. They were obsessed with poisoning. There were limits on what these groups could do. It is very different than that which can be perpetrated by a State. Let me conclude by saying that the possibility is remote of a mass scale biological weapons attack. Small scale attacks, biocrimes, like we may see in Florida, are possible. The government has the responsibility to do all that it can to prevent, protect and respond to events that seem unlikely. The challenge is to determine how much to prepare for a low probability, albeit potentially catastrophic attack, while at the same time guarding against not focusing enough on more probable events with significant but not necessarily catastrophic consequences. With that, Mr. Chairman, let me conclude. And I will be glad to answer any questions you or the members of the committee have. Mr. Shays. Thank you very much for your testimony and we will have a number of questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Parachini follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

Dr. Post, you can end this panel and then we will start with the questions. Dr. Post. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am honored to have the opportunity of addressing you on this important topic. A great deal of attention has been paid to the vulnerability of American society and what terrorists could do. I will be confining my remarks to what terrorists would do and wouldn't do, what their motivations and incentives are and what their constraints are for committing acts of the chem- bioterrorism. First, a note of vocabulary. There is a term often in use and I hope that this committee can play a role in killing this term and that is, weapons of mass destruction terrorism. It is an unfortunate term that is all too readily used. Certainly on September th, we saw mass destruction terrorism, indeed catastrophic super terrorism perpetrated in the guise of conventional terrorism. Similarly, the so-called weapons of mass destruction, chem- bio, radiological, nuclear, in fact, can be used with exquisite precision to the point of being able to kill a single individual in an assassination. Let me first take the committee rather swiftly through the spectrum of terrorism. I am going to attempt to both differentiate the threat by group and by attack type. And these remarks are elaborated in my prepared statement. You will see---- Mr. Shays. Now we have one in front of the table--you can't see it, but if we are looking down, don't think we are not paying attention. Dr. Post. First, across the top and differentiating, this is really quite variegated spectrum of terrorist groups. We have crusaders, criminals and crazies. Let me emphasize as a psychiatrist who has been working and understanding terrorist psychology, terrorists are not crazed psychotics despite the often misinterpretation of the public. In fact, terrorist groups expel emotionally disturbed members from their groups. They are a security risk. At the middle tier, I note in particular State-supported terrorism. As Mr. Parachini stated a moment ago, this is of grave concern for the reasons he indicated, in terms of the resources necessary, and I will come back to that in a moment. I will be focusing on the motivations and constraints for the sub State groups. First, across the left, we have social revolutionary terrorism. This is the groups who were particularly prominent during the 's and 's, red brigades, Red Army faction in this country, the Weather Underground following Marxist, Leninist doctrine. Still present, though, we have Japanese Red Army, a number Colombian social revolutionary groups as well. Right wing terrorism on the rise. In fact, a number of the small attacks of chemical biological terrorism have come from individual extremists within the right wing fringe. Nationalist separatist terrorism refers to the groups seeking to have an independent nation, be it the provisional Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland who have heard about the troubles from their fathers and grandfathers in the publics of northern Ireland or the radical Palestinian terrorists hearing of the lands taken from their families in the coffee houses of Beirut in the occupied territories. Of particular concern is the group that I have labeled religious extremist terrorism, both including new religions such as Aum Shinrikyo, which gave us the event which precipitated in many ways the major concern with this, the sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subways and religious extreme and religious fundamentalist terrorism. And of particular concern now, of course, Islamist radical extremist terrorism. Now if we could have the second graphic, please. What I would like to do now is walk you swiftly through this graphic. Down the left I have the groups I have just mentioned. Across the top, I have noted different types of attack. From my point of view, the major psychological thresholds across is not the weapon type, but the willingness to create mass casualties as was tragically demonstrated on September th. In fact, to echo Mr. Parachini, one could cause mass casualties with conventional weapons as has been done on a number of occasions going back to the Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Mr. Shays. Just announcing that we are going into session at a.m., you know, I say that but I am not necessarily right. I am still confused by this. Am I right guys, are we going into session at a.m., or is that a vote? We'll figure it out later. Dr. Post. I have also noted CBW hoax. I emphasize this because this is insufficiently considered. One can have a very powerful--successful terrorist act without ever spreading a molecule of substance about--and we have insufficiently considered our preparation for this. And finally, small scale attacks, large scale attacks and then the catastrophic attacks of which Mr. Parachini spoke. Now for the first two types, social revolutionary and national separatist groups, they are interested in influencing the west calling attention to their cause. It would be quite counterproductive for them to have either a mass casualty attack or an attack which damaged their constituents. It is possible but remote that they would choose to have a small scale attack that doesn't affect their constituents. Thus a Palestinian group might attack in Tel Aviv, but not in Jerusalem. For the right wing groups, we see some groups who have indeed participated lacking though, in fact, the resource and technology. Let me focus on the last two groups, the religious fundamentalist groups and the new religion terrorist. Here, in my judgment, there is little psychological constraint as has been demonstrated. Indeed, there is a desire to cause extreme casualties. In fact, some of the terrorists I have interviewed are quite interesting in saying there is no moral red line in terms of the amount of destruction. However, here we have, again, an issue where the resources necessary to carry this out are simply not present for the group. And what would be a great hazard here would be if we had a State supporting these groups such as Iraq, which has been one of the areas of concern. In my judgment, we need to be focusing our intelligence resources in particular on the groups of greatest concern, which would be those groups responsible for more than percent of the attacks in recent years where no responsibility has been claimed. They are not interested in influencing the west. They are interested in expelling the west. They don't need that New York Times headline, God knows. And this is the group of greatest concern. But even so, it is not of major concern, from my point of view, in my analytical judgment, in terms of catastrophic attacks. There is a possibility of focal attacks only. And we should not, in overreacting to this, neglect to focus on conventional terrorism because it is conventional terrorism that continues to be the source of mass casualties and continues to be the method of choice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Dr. Post follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Shays. My staff is a little disappointed with you, Dr. Post, because they were enjoying your testimony hoping you would read it. You were talking about religious fundamentalist terrorism and you say they were seeking to influence the west in the establishment. But in the past decades no responsibility's claimed for upwards of percent of terrorist acts. We believe this is because of the increasing frequency of terrorist acts by radical religious extremist terrorists. They're not trying to influence the west, rather, the radical Islamic terrorists are trying to expel the secular modernizing west and they do not need their name identified in a New York Times headline or in a story on CNN. They are ``killing in the name of God,'' and don't need official notice. After all, God knows. Somehow my staff thought that was rather an ingenious statement. So it is on the record, OK, Larry. At this time, I will call on Mr. Putnam. Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the panel for their outstanding opening remarks. My first question is for Dr. Alibek. You have related the history of the Castro regime's involvement in bioweapons development since the early 's, including a comment that you gave to the Miami Herald in . As a Floridian, I am very concerned because Cuba has a hostile regime miles off shore. What information do you have for us on the status of the Cuban regime's production of bioweapons? Mr. Alibek. I think of this question because in , it was quite a confusing situation because when I gave that interview, the State Department issued information saying that they had no information about any Cuban offensive biological weapons problem. But at the same time, Defense Intelligence Agency included Cuba in a group of countries involved in biological weapons activity. But my personal opinion and my personal experience of this, we have some information about this Cuban activity. We knew Cuba was interested in biological weapons research and development work. We knew that there were several centers; one of them was located close to Havana involved in, I would say, in military biological technology. And what was most amazing to us, we consider Cuba is not a well-developed country. But at the same time, Cuba has a very perfectly developed system of engineering and is capable to develop genetic engineering agents. They've got the desire to develop genetically engineered biological weapons. In my opinion, I strongly believe, and I still believe, this country discovered this capability and what the size of this program and what the level of achievement, of course, it is up to our intelligence services. Mr. Putnam. In the course of your work in the Soviet Union and your contacts with some of the Soviet satellite States, was there ever any motivation to develop biological or chemical weapons for the purpose of destroying agricultural crops or agriterrorism as opposed to inflicting mass casualties? Mr. Alibek. You are certainly right when you ask this question because in the Soviet Union, for example, there was a huge program. And this program included several directions and one direction, for example, to develop biological weapons to infect and kill human beings, troops and civilian population. Another was the program by the minister of agriculture. Mr. Shays. Another problem or program? Mr. Alibek. Another program to develop anti-crop and anti- livestock biological weapons. And there were several institutions involved in this business. And they developed, for example, biological weapons like rinderpest, African swine fever, foot in mouth disease, specifically intended to infect livestock. There was another part of this program to destroy crops, wheat, rye, rice and corn. Biological weapons program, they are huge programs and they include many different directions. And undoubt, agricultural weapons are usually a part of large biological weapons programs. Mr. Putnam. Is it safe to say that a number of the researchers who were working on those agricultural programs have now spread out through a number of other nations and regimes since the collapse of the Soviet Union? Mr. Alibek. Yes, you're right. Many of them are now overseas and work for some other countries. From my personal experience I know in the West, just in the West, we've got tens to hundreds of scientists with quite sophisticated biological weapons knowledge. How many of them now in the Middle East or some other countries, we have no idea. But there was some information that some of them left for Iran, for Iraq and for some other countries. Mr. Putnam. Dr. Post, I have a very brief amount of time remaining and so much to ask. From a psychological perspective is there a desire for a number of these regimes to focus on agricultural terrorism, attacking food safety scenarios, or are they more focused on the spectacle of an explosion and bodies in the streets and casualties and things of that sort? Dr. Post. One has to differentiate among both the regimes and the groups. For groups seeking to strike out and damage us, there certainly could be a motivation to strike out in the agricultural area. For groups seeking that terrorist spectacular, to have attention and notice paid to them, that would be much less likely just because of the nature of the manner in which the threat has persisted. This is certainly an area of significant concern from my point of view which has yet not been sufficiently addressed. Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Thank the gentleman. Mr. Allen, do you have a question? I'm sorry. I would like to acknowledge that Mr. Allen is here and Ms. Schakowsky and Mr. Clay. Mr. Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you all for being here today. I was struck by some of the differences I detected in Mr. Decker's testimony and Dr. Alibek's, so I would like to sort of push it back to you. I thought I heard Mr. Decker saying--I hope I heard Mr. Decker saying--that we need to go through a risk management process. We need to evaluate all the different threats out there. I thought the outline that you raised was a good one to look at a threat assessment, a vulnerability assessment and a criticality assessment. That's not what we've been doing in this country, and I can't help but think that the whole debate over missile defense would continue to be very different--if we actually looked at the threat of an ICBM being fired at this country in the context of all the different threats we face from states and from terrorist groups, we would approach it differently. And if it didn't feel so much like a crusade on the part of the advocates, those of us who are skeptics might have reacted a little differently. I thought I heard Dr. Alibek saying there really are thousands of different biological agents out there that could be used. The question that I'm interested in is how is it possible for us as a government and as a country, two different things, to start to do real risk management and bringing it to bear in this debate? Here's what I'm thinking: I think the GAO years ago recommended that a threat and risk assessment be developed by the FBI. The FBI said we would do it. I don't know if it's being done. I would like Mr. Decker to respond to that, the status of the recommendations and so on. But my overall question for any of you is, should we be asking different agencies like the FBI or the CIA or the Department of Defense to do separate threat and risk assessments and then try to get those separate assessments, kind of evaluate them, or do we want these different agencies to set up a structure that will allow them to do the threat and risk assessments together? Because I think we are in trouble if we just let the media take whatever threat is out there, whether it's anthrax day or some other biological agent another day or whatever, if we keep moving from crisis to crisis based on the latest story, we will not be doing our job well. That's a bit rambling. But what I'm looking for is some advice on the approach we could take to get to a more disciplined analysis of the threats and vulnerabilities that are out there. Maybe, Mr. Decker, you should begin. I have taken too much time. I apologize. [The prepared statement of Hon. Thomas H. Allen follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Decker. Sir, let me start with one piece of this. In kind of looking at what Governor Ridge has to do, he's leading an Office on Homeland Security. We're not sure what that homeland security truly means. But if you read the Executive order, clearly it's to combat acts of terrorism. That's pretty clear. One aspect of working on a national strategy has to be an understanding of the threat. Understanding the threat and threat assessments are two slightly different issues. One, the understanding of threat is something that is continuous, it's long term, it has hooks into the past, just like Mr. Parachini mentioned, that allows you then to do a threat assessment which I would make the analogy is more like a snapshot in time. It gives you an appreciation for a lot of different factors that can be used in a quantifiable way to make certain decisions. Now, the issue that I would raise, sir, is there are agencies, organizations that are better prepared and better structured and based on their mission to do threat assessments. I do think that the threat assessments, that process in the intelligence community and to a lesser degree with the law enforcement community, there is a difference in approach and model. But with the intelligence community they probably do good assessments at the national level, looking at specific issues, long-term issues, and these are typically call national intelligence estimates. These estimates, these assessments provide a road map, if you will, on understanding an issue that I would submit other experts should use when you do risk management. Risk management basically is a discussion. It's a conversation with people of different disciplines, different backgrounds, different perspectives, that are experts in an area to be able to make sense out of what the threat implication is to our assets. And to make sense out of that, you have to know a lot about yourself. What's vulnerable and has most important? So, at the national level, you could have a threat assessment and a real good one of everything that you know to date and then you have to put that into context. How would it affect my vulnerabilities? How does it exploit my weakness? What is most important that I have to protect and at what degree? And that's where leadership comes in to make those hard decisions. What is an acceptable level of risk once I consider all these factors? Mr. Allen. So you're talking about sorting out the large number of risks that Dr. Alibek was referring to, for example? Mr. Decker. Yes. Mr. Alibek. If I may, I'm not against a necessity that you do risk assessment. I am not against a necessity to do a risk assessment. But, you know, I feel always a sort of resistance, reluctance when we discuss a necessity to develop a sort of priority, what is more likely and what is less likely and so on and so forth. Let me give you a couple of examples. In the early 's, before I came to the United States, there was a work--I would call it risk assessment work in the field of biological weapons. This work was done by some intelligence services here in the United States, and the recommendations was sent to the Department of Defense. And, you know, according to that assessment, the most threat in biological weapons in the future would be bacterial biological weapons and toxin biological weapons. Resulting from this assessment, the entire division of the Institute of Medical Defense, medical research, was eliminated, division which was responsible for protection against biological weapons in 's. And for years it didn't exist. After some people came from the East and said, OK, guys let's analyze what we are having here in this field, what was the result? Yes, biological weapons would--the most effective biological weapons would be bacterial and viral biological weapons. Toxins in terms of military deployment wouldn't be very effective. It was the result of many years study done in the Soviet Union and, unfortunately, in some other countries. In this case, you can imagine this type of approach led to the entire destruction of the entire division and entire direction in biological weapons defense. If we use this approach, in my opinion, we--again, we're going to make the same mistake we already made before in our history. Mr. Shays. Could I just jump in, if the gentleman would yield, even though his time has run out, I would like them all to go through and answer your question. But I would just intuitively respond that maybe the assessment wasn't done properly. And I would also say that it would strike me that you have to update your assessment every year. So that if you had updated your assessment every year, you might not have found the result that you ended up with. Mr. Alibek. Of course, the problem is this: My position when we discuss biological threat and bioterrorism, you know, I am saying, that's right. There are many different agents would be used. There are many techniques could be used. But it's not a situation in which we are not able to do a comprehensive analysis and to develop a new understanding, contemporary modern understanding of biological weapon threat. It's not something impossible. We can do this. It's only a problem in this case to find right professionals to do this assessment. Mr. Shays. Mr. Parachini and Mr. Post, you both want to respond to his question? Then I will go to Ms. Schakowsky. Mr. Parachini. I was struck in Mr. Decker's response by his emphasis as an important part of the threat assessment being intentions. And to underline your comments, Mr. Allen, you spoke about some of the skepticism. Let's go back to the cold war. We tended in retrospect to overevaluate the threat from the Soviet Union because we were paying too much attention to capability and insufficient attention to intention. In dealing with closed societies and closed groups and organizations such as al Qaeda, we are significantly impaired from making intelligence estimates of intention and therefore tend to go to the worst-case scenario. This really emphasizes how crucial it is to be able to get into the heads of our adversaries more effectively than we have been at the present time. Mr. Shays. The challenge with that, though, is intentions can change from moment to moment but capability may be a little more long term. So we could--it would strike me we could think we know their intention but their intention could change overnight. Dr. Post. I don't see it quite that way, that intentions change from moment to moment. There is a linear track. Now, having said that, certainly Osama bin Laden is a remarkably innovative leader. He has spoken in almost taunting fashion about his willingness to use such weapons, which in itself is often terrifying. Mr. Allen. The only thing I would add to that in response is that when you're trying--it's different, I think, trying to gauge the intention of a terrorist group, which has a pretty clearly stated mission in this case, as compared to a state, a country which isn't going to move anywhere. And part of the debate about missile defense and the question of intentions is the fact that missiles that are launched can be traced right back to the site from which they were launched. But I don't mean to drag that whole debate into this one. Dr. Post. Just to elaborate on your point, though, the goal of no state is to terrorize. They will use terrorism to support their foreign policy goals, but when it becomes counterproductive for the state they are deterred just by the factors you illuminate. When you have a group whose primary goal is in fact to create terror in the service of coercion--and I think it should be remembered terrorism is at heart psychological warfare. It's violence as communication. It's designed to accomplish goals through creating terror, not through proliferation of bodies. Mr. Shays. Ms. Schakowsky, you have been very patient. Thank you very much. You have the floor. Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you for continuing what you started well before September th in looking into these matters. In that regard, I want to credit Representative Tierney for some questions that he asked and wanted to ask today that--he is not here right now. On June th and July th, this subcommittee held hearings on the biological weapons convention; and this international treaty, which was signed in , has signatories prohibiting states from developing biological agents for offensive purposes. The problem that was acknowledged was that this treaty contains no inspection provisions and relies on international political pressure to ensure that there is compliance. And, as you stated in your recommendations, Dr. Alibek, that for many years the Soviet Union was able to hide an enormous biological weapons program. So, clearly, inspections is an issue. The last administration developed a protocol that would establish an inspection regime; and the current administration has, for unknown reasons, ``concluded that the current version of the protocol would be inefficient in stopping cheating.'' At the July th hearing Mr. Tierney asked the administration witness, Ambassador Mahley, if he had prepared an analysis of the objections to this draft protocol which would require inspections. He said he had. He said that he would provide it. There was a motion that was adopted in the subcommittee, and then there was a request in writing. Three months have passed, and so Mr. Tierney has asked that the subcommittee take active measures, Mr. Chairman, to obtain that report by Ambassador Mahley that was promised months ago. While we understand that these are very busy times for the administration, but it seems to me that just delivering a report that was already done is a reasonable request. So I want to---- Mr. Shays. Would the gentlelady yield? It's an absolutely reasonable request. We have requested it, and we'll go back and ask that it be provided. Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Mr. Tierney and myself as well. I wanted to then ask the panel if it is your belief, considering we've been talking about how you develop threat assessment, the relationship of state programs and terrorist programs developing biological weapons, whether or not this protocol requiring inspection would give us, in fact, another level of protection and if it's possible in your view to implement such a protocol effectively. Anyone who wishes to respond. Mr. Parachini. I think part of the question is whether the protocol helps or hurts. And the intention is clearly to help, but it in itself will not be sufficient. I think part of the problem of arms control in the post cold war period is that our expectations have been very high. Yet it has been very difficult to pinpoint in a multilateral context the security problems that we face with an arms control tool. So the arms control tool will be useful but not sufficient. My understanding of what Ambassador Mahley has said was that the administration wants to think about this in a much broader way and not be locked into just seeing the BWC as the way to address the problem, that there is a whole range of other tools such as regulating more effectively commerce and infectious diseases. We have some regulations in the United States, but on an international basis it's an open market. Pathogens are traded around the world without any of the normal controls. Disease surveillance, something that the committee I know has looked at several times, we're getting a little better at it here in the United States. But we're in a global environment. Global surveillance in other parts of the world where emerging infectious diseases are appearing is not near at the level ours is, and most public health officials in the United States say ours is not adequate. So these are very different tools other than arms control to address this problem. Ms. Schakowsky. Is there a counterproposal to the protocol? Mr. Parachini. That is part of the challenge that the administration is on the hook for, to provide that. These are not easy solutions, and it's not easy to come up with a package of new things. This is a totally new environment, and I commend the administration for trying to do some new thinking. Their challenge is to do it in a speedy fashion. Mr. Alibek. If I may, a small addition, in , I was a part of this process called a three-lateral agreement between the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union to inspect or visit some biological weapons facilities--or suspected of being biological weapons facilities. Now I know one of the biggest problems was to prove whether or not one or another facility was actually--is it a BW facility or defense facility? It's one of the problems. But when we discuss a new protocol, I envision three major problems. First problem is this: Terrorist organizations, they don't sign any treaties. And for them, of course, it doesn't matter what kind of protocol we sign. It's not going to affect their activity. Second problem, we say, for example, one of the reasons a new administration---- Ms. Schakowsky. To the extent they may use state-run facilities to advance their agenda. Mr. Alibek. Yes, that is right. But the problem is this when we discuss biological weapons--you know, my biggest concern is this. When people say biological weapons require many efforts, we wouldn't see any significant events. We use some examples cited, Aum Shinrikyo--I feel a very significant resistance because we use absolute incorrect examples. The problem is this. When we use example of Aum Shinrikyo, nobody pays attention. But Aum Shinrikyo was not capable to get a virulent strain. What they did, they used a non-virulent strain. That's why they were not able to get any casualties. When we discuss about likelihood of--small likelihood of create a significant terrorist attack, I completely disagree. I know the real power of biological weapons, and I know what kind of results we can get. But you know when we discuss this treaty, one of the biggest problems is this. For example, existing administration, current administration is saying we cannot put our pharmaceutical industry in danger because it will let some inspectors come and see our production facilities and it would cause some significant harm. It's incorrect. As a biotechnologist, if I come to a new facility or any facility and see some equipment, for example, to manufacture one or another product, it says absolutely nothing to me. What I need to know, I need to see specific documentation just to determine whether or not I am able to get some information to use in my own country. Mr. Shays. Could I interrupt the gentleman? You said such a strong statement that no one else has concurred with you. You said it provides you absolutely no information. Let me just make my point. I wouldn't suggest it tells you everything, but it tells you something. I have had more pharmaceutical people tell me that the shape of the pipes, where the pipes--where they connect and so on say a lot about the process that they use to develop the particular pharmaceutical drug. Mr. Alibek. That's not true. First of all, all of technology processes---- Mr. Shays. May I ask you a question? Were you on both sides of this equation or on one side of the equation? Mr. Alibek. On both. Because the problem is this. By technological processes, production facilities, they have quite similar equipment. There are some differences in equipment design, some computer programming to program production facilities. You could see some equipment, for example, special equipment to purify one product. But, you know, the--a major know-how is inside of these columns, not outside. Mr. Shays. I just want to move on. I'm not disagreeing with you now. You said you've been on both sides and your statement will stand on the record. Mr. Alibek. If I may, one more thing. When we include in this protocol, a necessity to inspect, for example, suspected facilities, having four member team and -week notice, in my opinion is a mockery. Because for weeks it's possible to hide any BW production. Mr. Shays. Could I just ask, is it possible to hide it in a day? Mr. Alibek. In small production could be hidden very easily within to -week period. Mr. Shays. Thank you. Mr. Clay, you're on. Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me also thank the witnesses for being here to share with us their knowledge and experience. The purpose of the hearing is among the highest priority that we may have as a country. We have to examine the factors that should be considered in assessing the risk of biological terrorism. Just months ago the subject would have been as serious but would not have had the urgency and the knowledge that this has to be addressed and acted upon post haste. September , , changed any perception that biological terrorism was only a possibility. It is now a probability and, depending on the results of the investigation ongoing in Boca Raton, FL, it may be a reality. However, we must not assume answers before the investigation is complete. The threat is real. It will remain real for the foreseeable future. The American people need both procedures and actions for the knowledge of how to implement those procedures that are established. Mr. Decker, you have repeatedly reported that we as a country lack a comprehensive assessment of the terrorist threats against us. The problem as you describe it is that, without this assessment, we haven't done a comparison and prioritization to allow us to plan intelligently. Is that a correct description of your findings? [The prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Decker. Congressman Clay, that is correct. Mr. Clay. OK. And, as a result, there is a risk that our spending and preparation may be misaligned, is that right? Mr. Decker. I would hope that our investment returns the most interest for the Nation, and I'm not sure that's the case without that threat assessment. Mr. Shays. Your answer was really a yes, right? Mr. Decker. Yes. Mr. Clay. You know, let's talk about preparedness of the American public. I've heard that you can acquire a vaccine for anthrax. Should there be a run on getting that vaccine by the American public? Should we be concerned? And anyone on the panel can answer. Mr. Decker. I'd let my distinguished colleague, Dr. Alibek, comment on that. Mr. Clay. Should there be a run on the anthrax vaccine? Should the American public start---- Mr. Alibek. Let's imagine the situation. We're able to manufacture enough doses of vaccine to vaccinate the entire population of the United States. Theoretically, it's possible, but it would be a significant problem, financial problem, logistical problem and so on and so forth, a medical problem as well. But, at the same time, let's imagine the situation, as I said before, there are many different agents and you vaccinate just against anthrax, it means somebody who has a desire to deploy biological weapons would use something else. Having people vaccinated against anthrax we would force these terrorist groups to develop and to deploy something else-- plague, tuberculosis, something else. When we talk about this, in my opinion it's not a perfect idea to vaccinate people because--keeping in mind that the number of agents is quite large. Any time you vaccinate against one agent you are in danger to be infected by another one. Mr. Clay. One more question, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. You have no problem. Mr. Clay. We agreed that numerous technical problems are there with acquiring, producing and weaponizing biological agents. Mr. Decker, you stated in a past report, ``a leading expert told us that the whole process entails risk. For example, anthrax powders easily adhere to rubber gloves and pose a handling problem. Effectively disseminating the agent can pose technical challenges in that proper equipment and energy sources are needed. A less sophisticated product in dissemination method can cause illness or death.'' As a result of these conclusions, would you say that terrorists or rogue states are more likely to seek out legitimate covers for their illegitimate activities such as pharmaceutical plants or the like? Mr. Decker. Sir, I have no direct evidence to be able to support that, but it would seem likely. Mr. Clay. Likely that they would use these plants as covers? Mr. Decker. I can only state that it would seem logical, but I have no factual documentation to support that. Mr. Clay. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Thank the gentleman. I haven't done my round yet. I'm going to do minutes, then another , then we'll just go back to the other Members. I'd like to go fairly quickly if I can. If we have agreement, so then we not discuss those things, only where there might be disagreement. Mr. Decker has come forward with the whole concept that risk management is a systematic and analytical process to consider the likelihood that a threat will endanger an asset and so on. Then he broke it down into three: threat assessment, vulnerability assessment and critical assessment. The bottom line to a threat assessment is a threat assessment is used to evaluate the likelihood of a terrorist activity against a given asset or location. Then he basically said a vulnerability assessment is a process that identifies weaknesses in fiscal structures and so on. Then he said a criticality assessment is a process designed to systematically identify and evaluate important assets and infrastructures in terms of various factors such as the mission and so on. Do any of you disagree with this as being a framework with which the committee could work in dealing with management, risk management? Does this make sense to you, Dr. Alibek; to you, Mr. Parachini; to you, Dr. Post? Mr. Alibek. In general, it makes sense. Mr. Parachini. Just make sure I understand. Mr. Shays. He's giving us a way to process this. I want to know if you are comfortable with it or whether you would amend it. Mr. Parachini. An important part of this, if I understand what has been proposed, is to factor in motives into the vulnerability assessment. I think that's what Dr. Post has talked about. Too often, we just focus on the vulnerability or we just focus on the criticality, and we don't think what the capabilities put together with motives might produce. So that's an important point. Mr. Shays. OK, did you want to make a point Dr. Alibek? Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, that is correct. But when we discuss risk assessment, my position is still the same. We need to analyze the entire problem and to see what all possible ways to deploy and to develop biological weapons and what agents could be used. You know, I would use a broader definition for risk assessment. Mr. Shays. OK. Well, I'm going to come right back to you in a second. Dr. Post, your issue on motivation, anything else? Dr. Post. I would concur with what John Parachini has just said. And to me this is the weakest aspect of our capability of conducting a thorough risk assessment at this point, an insufficient ability to have the data to make a good evaluation of intentions. Mr. Shays. Let me expose my ignorance, Mr. Decker. I have basically said continually whenever I've had the opportunity that we've had three commissions that have come before us. They said, we don't have a proper assessment of the terrorist threat, we don't have a strategy to deal with a threat, and we aren't organized to maximize our resources to be effective to implement the strategy and succeed against the threat. Now, I've just made this blanket ``we don't have a proper assessment of a threat.'' You're breaking that first one down into parts, correct? Mr. Decker. Not exactly, sir. What I'm saying is, threat assessment by itself is not enough---- Mr. Shays. OK. Mr. Decker [continuing]. To craft a cogent national strategy with effective actions. Mr. Shays. So we need more than threat assessment. Mr. Decker. Yes. Mr. Shays. So you have termed it risk management, and you have divided it into these three things--the threat assessment, vulnerability assessment and criticality assessment. You jumped in, Mr. Parachini, and said, motives go in there. Where would motives go in those three or is it a separate identity? Would it go under threat or would it go--it would go under threat, I guess. And you, Dr. Alibek, would take these three and add something else to it. You spoke too general for me for it to be helpful. Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, what needs to be said--not just threat assessment. Threat assessment, defense assessment is very important. Mr. Shays. What, our capability to respond? Mr. Alibek. Our capability to respond. Mr. Shays. Help me out, Mr. Decker. Where would that go in your line of thinking? Mr. Decker. The risk management approach is when you're looking at preparedness. Mr. Shays. OK. Mr. Decker. We're really talking primarily about the defense, the preparedness of the homeland. Mr. Shays. We're talking about the detection and prevention part of it. Mr. Alibek. Not just the detection and prevention. Of course, prevention is very, very important. When we talk about defense assessment or our preparedness, we need to keep in mind three major issues--detection, prevention and treatment. Mr. Shays. What was the last word? Mr. Alibek. Treatment. Mr. Shays. Treatment? Mr. Alibek. Treatment, yeah. Mr. Shays. How you treat it. OK. My staff understands. Then they make me feel ignorant here. That meant nothing to me. He said it five times--treatment, treatment, treatment--but it doesn't help. What do you mean? Mr. Alibek. The problem, one of the major things, biological weapons cause infectious diseases. In terms of protection---- Mr. Shays. Do you mean response instead of treatment? Mr. Alibek. No, when we discuss response, we need to keep in mind three major directions in medical response. I would say--but not general response. Detection is a technical response, then protection is a medical response, and medical and technical response and treatment. Mr. Shays. Oh, I see. I misunderstood. I was thinking you meant detect the attack. You mean detect--so in that--I understand treatment in that basis. You're saying once there is the like--if you've detected that someone has a pathogen, that they are--they have been ill, you want to detect it, you want to protect them and treat them. Mr. Alibek. That's correct. Mr. Shays. OK. Now I understand. No wonder you thought I was an idiot here. I'm fascinated by your chart, Dr. Post. Because--let me just first get it here--it seems to me you're almost doing what the FBI has done. I'm not being really fair to you, so you'll get a chance to enlighten me. The FBI has said, there will be an attack, you know. It's like we needed to pay the FBI to tell us there will be an attack. We all know there is going to be an attack. We all know it could happen in the next days. We all know it is serious, and we all know it could happen weeks from now. What you did on your scales--on your markings of the X and the star, you basically--you have the check as being less constrained and while still unlikely could rationalize such an act. So the check does not indicate likelihood of committing such an act but refers to motivation only. Well, that maybe answers my question. You're saying that these are not likely but that--help me out. Dr. Post. I'm glad you picked up on that. Because I think the check is somewhat misleading. This doesn't mean they are likely to do this. They are less psychologically and motivationally constrained. Having said that, they still need resource and technology. And if they are succeeding abundantly with conventional terrorism and don't have the handling risk, there is really very little incentive to move forward. The one major caveat in terms of that as I have studied Osama bin Laden, I've regularly been struck by--I think we can reliably predict we will be surprised by him. And he is remarkably innovative. Spends a great deal of time preparing, and then we have a terrorist spectacular. So I am by no means confident he would not move in this direction, not that he can't cause mass casualties with conventional terrorism but because he recognizes the terror that such an act would inflict. Mr. Shays. You want to say something, Mr. Parachini? Mr. Parachini. Let me contrast with Dr. Post on this point. I think there is a certain psychic thrill from the explosion or the dramatic event that a terrorist does not get in the delayed gratification of making people sick with disease. And if there was a way that bin Laden could think about to get that immediate response and there was that immediate sense of fear it might be of greater interest to him, but there are other alternatives that he turns to that he does achieve that. Mr. Shays. Well, a mass exodus of a city because people think there's a biological or chemical attack would give him quite a thrill. Because that would be pretty---- Dr. Post. I do agree with that. I don't want to accuse you of practicing without a license here---- Mr. Shays. You just did. Dr. Post [continuing]. But I do think indeed that part of what has been quite gratifying in his several interviews where he has actually suggested the questions about can bioterrorism has been that this is a way of inflicting terror and the notion of terrorizing the United States is a major source of satisfaction in his mission to be commander in chief of the Islamic world against the West. Mr. Parachini. I think if you look at all those interviews it's actually journalists who raise the question first and then he then responds to it. Dr. Post. That's actually not correct. That was my initial reaction. I've traced that back. The question---- Mr. Shays. This is based on interviews you've had with different---- Dr. Post. No, no. These are CNN, ABC, CBS interviews. Mr. Shays. Did I give you credit for something undeserved? My understanding is that you have had contact and interviewed a number of---- Dr. Post. We just completed a project interviewing incarcerated Middle Eastern terrorists both in Palestinian and Israeli prisons and have a number of really quite dramatic quotes from them. I also served as expert witness in New York in the Federal trial of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Shays. So this is something you have done a lot of research on. Dr. Post. Yes. But on your point I agree with you. There is a satisfaction to the big bang. Having said that, it's quite clear to me that a major motivation for Osama bin Laden, as his last two statements indicated, is inflicting terror. And one gets a great deal--the mere act of doing that in and of itself is sufficient. But that leads me to believe that even a focal chem-bio attack which was then attributed to him would be powerfully magnifying of his stature. Mr. Parachini. Here is where Dr. Alibek makes a very helpful point about treatment and protective measures. It is in our capacity to control the impact of a biological attack which is fundamentally different from a chemical attack where you would have an immediate response. Bin Laden has consistently moved ahead with explosives. He has killed lots of people. The only people who--the only subnational entities that have used biological agents have been people who were obsessed with poisons. And Aum, which is the one we fear the most because they are like bin Laden, had lots of resources, failed in all their attempts, including the case of anthrax where what they used was veterinarian vaccine anthrax. It was not a virulent agent. So this is not as easy to do unless you're possessed to try and do it. Bin Laden is not possessed. He is an operator that we really have to deal with. Dr. Post. To add to that in one other point, several of the radical Islamic terrorists we spoke to indicated that the Koran proscribes the use of poison. And that was a disincentive. Most of the terrorists we interviewed said there was--they would do it if they were ordered to do it, but in fact give me a good Kalashnikov and there was no real consideration of this as a tactic among the radical Islamic terrorists that we had interviewed. Mr. Shays. Let me just say we're going to get back to this whole issue of treatment. Because I have had too many people-- and not right this minute, though, but because I want to give Mr. Gilman a chance and Mrs. Schakowsky to come back. But I just preface it by saying to you, so when I come to my next round, that when I saw the attack on September th I almost physically fell to my knees in the horror of it, like all of us did. The absolute horror of seeing the attack, to see the plane go on another, to see the building just implode, to hear the explosion at the Pentagon. But I think I fell more to my knees because I've had so many hearings where I've had people say to me, credible witnesses, that they have the capability--pleasant sound--we have the capability. And I thought they did, but the only restraint on them was they wouldn't want to have killed so many people. And that went--you know, that just totally--it just flipped on that moment. They were willing to annihilate , people. So I understand your point that these weapons of biological and chemical can be very precise so they can be--they can very much be pinpointed and not a weapon of mass destruction. But they can also be very indiscriminate. Dr. Post. This is true. And your point about the willingness to take mass casualties, one of the questions we asked in our interviews was was there any moral red line in terms of the extent of destruction, the extent of casualties; and for several of the groups, in fact, there are significant red lines that would be counterproductive for their cause. Let me just read: The more an attack hurts the enemy, the more important it is. That is the measure. The mass killings, especially the suicide bombings, were the biggest threat, and so most efforts were devoted to these. The extent of the damage and the number of casualties are of primary importance. In a jihad, there are no red lines. I find that a rather chilling comment. Mr. Shays. It is chilling. Mr. Gilman. Mr. Gilman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. You're going to have minutes. Mr. Gilman. I'm impressed by Dr. Alibek's focus of attention on the fact that we don't have a proper, appropriate coordination amongst our agencies and recommends a single specialized agency to take over. I note that we have organizations with some responsibility in our government. DOD, Defense, Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control, Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, FBI, CIA, NSA and FEMA, all have some responsibility. But there is no coordination, as we found in other areas that we're addressing. I think his recommendation that there should be an agency focused solely on biological terrorism, biological defense is a meritorious one, and I'd like to pursue it, but I'd like our other panelists to give us their views on Dr. Alibek's proposal. Mr. Decker. Mr. Decker. Congressman Gilman, this is the--I think Dr. Alibek's proposal is analogous to some of the comments from the Hart-Rudman Commission when they talk about consolidating certain functions under one organization to deal with border security issues. And the analogy would be obviously dealing with bioissues or---- Mr. Gilman. Do you support the proposal? Mr. Decker. Sir, our agency has not done enough work in this area to determine is it better for the country to have an apparatus like this versus improving what we currently have. Mr. Gilman. Mr. Parachini. Mr. Parachini. This is sort of a novel concept. It's the sort of thing one expects from Dr. Alibek, sort of new thinking. You know, Governor Ridge could take this challenge on, among others. Mr. Gilman. Ridge is going to have a myriad of responsibilities. But Mr. Alibek is recommending that there be one specialized agency. What is your feeling? Yes or no. Mr. Parachini. It might be too narrow of a task. There are already a number of entities within the Pentagon that work on biological defense and critically DARPA does a lot of the research that Dr. Alibek is pointing to. So I would be reluctant to create yet another government agency to address this problem when I think already within the Pentagon there is a fairly robust agency. Mr. Gilman. Well, besides the Pentagon, all of those other agencies I just recited that have some part of it--HHS, DOC, DOJ, CIA, FBI and NSA, FEMA--it seems to me you need some centralized authority. Mr. Parachini. There is a natural inclination to find a central organization to coordinate. If we can accomplish integration without necessarily overlaying another layer of---- Mr. Gilman. How do you get integration with all of these agencies out there? Mr. Parachini. Some of the interagency processes I think function very well. It's a matter of leadership to task them in the right way. Mr. Gilman. How do you feel, Mr. Post? Dr. Post. Having an intelligence background, having sat in on many national intelligence meetings, I would think that something would be lost in having too much of a homogenization of functions. There is a utility to having different organizations, and often it would be a greater clarity emerges from the clash of ideas. Mr. Gilman. So I take it the consensus is you have some reservations about pursuing it. Dr. Alibek. Mr. Alibek. If I may, to clarify this idea. You know, I am dealing with many agencies. I talk to many experts from different agencies and departments. The problem is this. I didn't mean to--just to have an agency just to conduct this work. It's a completely different idea. The idea, because as I said before the problem of biological weapon threat and biological weapons defense is so comprehensive, is so complex, it's absolutely impossible to have a huge number of agencies or departments responsible for different pieces of this huge puzzle. And when we start collecting all these pieces of puzzle in sort of picture what we see now, we see a lot of duplication, I mean, just many agencies doing the same work. Many government contractors, they do absolutely the same projects. We see a huge number of absolutely the same efforts run by different agencies and departments. And, you know, when you start collecting you realize we have a lot of work under different leadership, under different agencies, same work. While at the same time you can see a lot of holes in this puzzle of biological weapon threat analysis and defense. Mr. Gilman. Dr. Alibek, let me interrupt you. Dr. Alibek, you were the head of an agency in the Soviet Union that concentrated all of the efforts on biological and chemical warfare in your agency, is that correct? Mr. Alibek. Yes, that's absolutely correct. Mr. Shays. Would the gentleman suspend a second? Does it also include defense as well as offensive? Mr. Alibek. It includes both offensive and defensive issues. Just my personal experience, I don't want a supercentralization, I would say, but you know when you've got an agency, it's not a superagency which is capable to do everything and to remove people and so on and so forth--but when you've got an agency which is controlling all situation-- the entire situation in this field, when it knows what kind of agency involved in what kind of work, what subcontractors are doing what kind of work--now, for example, I can say again you mentioned specific agencies. I see, for example, there is an entity, a large government contractor running the project who develop so-called encyclopedia of biological weapons. We might be in a senseless work. We spent millions of dollars to do this. But at the same time there is another agency running another project with similar tasks. Mr. Gilman. A lot of overlap. Mr. Alibek. Not just overlap. A lot of senseless work. A lot of overlap. In this case, of course, when we say about $ or $ million in this field, just if you start analyzing all this puzzle, you would see that percent of this money is overlapping each other. Mr. Gilman. In your agency in the Soviet Union you had over , workers all concentrating on biological and chemical warfare. Mr. Alibek. , workers, about facilities concentrated there both biological weapons research, biological weapon development, biological weapon production, biological weapons defense. Mr. Gilman. How long did that agency exist in the Soviet Union? Mr. Alibek. It existed from to . But now a similar agency exists under the Minister of Defense. It's similar agency but dealing with military issues of biological weapons and biological weapons defense. But it's a military agency. Mr. Gilman. Mr. Chairman, I hope that we can take another look at all of this since you were so forceful in your leadership on the fractionalization with other authorities with regard to terrorism and other aspects of chemical warfare. Let me ask the panelists, how do we force all of our agencies to share information? For example, you told us that there was a lack of sharing of intelligence between the FBI and the INS with regard to the hostage plane, that one of the hostage planes had taken place and had there been a sharing it could have been prevented. What are your thoughts? How do we improve the sharing of intelligence? Dr. Post. It seems to me, if I might note, that one of the better outcomes of this tragic event was cooperation on two levels which has been deficient in the past, both within the U.S. Government among agencies where there really is a significant press now to fully cooperate and share information and, at least as importantly, among the international community. One simply cannot assess this problem independently, either in any agency within the government or the United States alone without active sharing of information. And I think we are moving--there has been a kind of quantum leap as I have come to understand that cooperation. Mr. Gilman. Any mandates necessary domestically to do that? Should we have some mandate that there be forceful sharing of intelligence in---- Dr. Post. There are, of course, problems with the different perspectives of the agencies which will always be present-- having an informant versus having a witness, is this a crime or is this a developing information. Understanding--I have been regularly been struck at interagency meetings between Defense, CIA and FBI that one has three different perspectives coming to bear. Terrorism is crime. Terrorism is political action. Terrorism is a low-intensity conflict. But the issue you're drawing attention to is absolutely crucial, and any efforts that can be brought to improve that cooperation I think would be welcome. Mr. Gilman. Dr. Alibek, if reports are correct that the Soviet Union used the biological weapon Glanders against the Mujahadin in , what is the likelihood that terrorist groups from Afghanistan would use those kind of weapons against their adversaries? Mr. Alibek. Yes, you are absolutely right. There was credible information about the use of Glanders in against Mujahadins in some remote locations of Afghanistan. Glanders is a bacterial infection, very easy to grow, very easy to concentrate. If not treated, it has up to percent mortality rate. Very stable in aerosol and has some persistent forms. In this case, just when we talk about difficulties, in my opinion, it's not difficult. Likelihood I would say is high. Mr. Gilman. Glanders is a--they tell me that is a bacteria that's highly lethal, is that correct? Mr. Alibek. It's not highly lethal. I would call it incapacitating agent. If it stayed well we would have about a percent mortality rate. Without treatment, it would increase up to percent. Mr. Gilman. Has any---- Mr. Shays. If the gentleman--it has gone about or minutes. Mr. Gilman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Let me ask you, do you gentleman have until : ? Does anybody have a problem until : ? I'm going to quickly vote while Ms. Schakowsky--I'm going to let her recess. I'm going to let her recess in the meantime. I hope to be back shortly after we recess. Then we'll get right--started again. Is that all right? Ms. Schakowsky [presiding]. I just have a couple of questions. It seems to me as if Dr. Alibek says one of the goals of biological weapons is to incite panic and fear. In some degree that has already been accomplished, that there is an incredible preoccupation right now with biological terrorism and emphasized, I think, with the three cases of anthrax right now in Florida. But it has also focused attention on the public health infrastructure. And I apologize for being here. I have looked through the testimony, and I know you were talking about threat, but if you were to prioritize where we are now putting our emphasis in response, both to prepare against and to be ready should something happen, where would you put the priority of bolstering our public health infrastructure, the capacity to recognize a biological attack, to have the necessary vaccines, to have the communication systems that we need? We have heard about weaknesses on every level. In comparison, then, to the threat, how important is it to act now to address the public health infrastructure? Anyone can answer. Mr. Parachini. The value of your question is it points to opportunities for what I would call dual-use spending. There are things that we can do that improve our capabilities and our public health system to, for example, detect emerging infectious diseases that occur naturally that are not intentional. And as a by-product of that, we also include our capability to--the low probability of an intentional use of a biological agent. Ms. Schakowsky. So in comparison, though, for example, in terms of airline safety, other transportation modes, where would you put---- Mr. Parachini. Now you are broadening the spectrum beyond just within the biological area. Ms. Schakowsky. However you want to frame it. But how important is it? Mr. Parachini. Well, I would want to make investments that we get dual-use benefit across the board. Specialized investments just to address that terrorist problem or that terrorist problem today will be outdated tomorrow. And I am not fully in agreement that the only role of biological weapons is to inflict terror. And indeed, in , in the United States, the use of biological agents was not to terrorize, but was specifically to incapacitate people. Ms. Schakowsky. Oh, no. I'm just saying if that is one of the goals that--in part that has been achieved already. Mr. Parachini. If that is one of the goals, we would have to have somebody say that is what they intended to do, or we would have to get a defector, or we would have to have somebody on a witness stand say that. And while we think that, we actually have not had a terrorist or a defector talk about biological weapons for terror. We have them talk about them as effective killing weapons or effective incapacitating weapons. But when we are talking about biological weapons for terror, we are really projecting our fear into what we think they're thinking. It's not clear to me that's the case. Mr. Alibek. If I may, when the Soviet Union was developing biological weapons, the Soviet Union developed its own doctrine and classification of biological weapons. Biological weapons have been divided into so-called strategic biological weapons, operational biological weapons, and the major idea was to kill as many as possible people. Biological weapons, according to the Soviet Union's military doctrine, would be used to kill people. The United States' old--very old program existed in the 's and 's, intended to use incapacitating biological weapons. But what was important for the Soviet military strategists, everybody understood that in case of deploying biological weapons, one of the biggest problems would be in the country of deployment. It is huge panic, full distraction of any activity, vital military activity, because people actually, in addition to being infected, diseased and killed, they are afraid of biological weapons because they don't understand what it is. And it is one of the biggest problems. Another I think we are going to need to keep in mind, when we talk about biological weapons--and you know what worries me? When we discuss what kind of event we could see and whether or not we would see a sort of a small event like we saw several days ago in Florida, or it could result in some significant casualty number, the problem is this, and just what I would like to repeat once again: There is no single answer. We cannot say--we cannot insist saying biological weapons cannot produce a significant casualty effect. We cannot say at the same time-- we cannot say biological weapons are so effective that we could see a second doomsday, for example, and to produce sort of a doomsday scenario. In my opinion, what we need to do--that is why I said about our lack of understanding of the biological weapon threat. We need to understand it. Depending upon many different scenarios, agents, techniques, concentration of the agent, amount of the agent deployed and so on and so forth, we could see from dozens to hundreds of thousands of casualties. Ms. Schakowsky. I am going to have to go vote, and I am going to recess the committee right now. [Recess.] Mr. Shays [presiding]. Mr. Alibek thinks he has until : to get back. Sometimes wars get started by miscommunication, but we can deal with it on our own. Calling this hearing to order. You all have been informed of a CNN story that an employee of NBC in New York has tested positive for anthrax, and that was Friday. The FBI and CDC are investigating. Now, then, they got the story wrong, because they said the anthrax is not the same respiratory anthrax that killed a Florida man. The employee tested positive for cutaneous anthrax. In other words, it is still the same anthrax, it is just by skin rather than by air. What is your reaction, Dr. Post, concern? Dr. Post. Each time we hear one of these events, it regularly heightens our own suspiciousness, and there is a kind of hyperactive community now. But I must say that it is troubling, and I would like to learn more about that, but especially when it hits a news agency, what could that mean? Mr. Shays. They make a mistake if they take on the news industry; don't you think? Dr. Post. There is no limit to whom they will take on. Mr. Shays. Why don't I go to you, Mr. Parachini. What I was going to say to you, as I have said, based on the plus hearings we have had and the briefings we have had, I say the following: That it is not a question if there will be a chemical or biological attack, and it's a question of when, where and what magnitude. And I qualify the magnitude to be the less likely is the -year storm. Do you find that a statement you can agree with or disagree? Mr. Parachini. I agree with that. I think you are characterizing the scope and magnitude of the problem in the right way. Dr. Post. And motivationally, the issue of the -year storm for almost all terrorist groups would be highly counterproductive and have no positive incentive. Mr. Shays. Well, I used to think that before, but why now? I used to think that before, but not anymore. I mean, I don't see based on your comment about the red line---- Dr. Post. I said for almost all terrorist groups, the one exception being the Islamist radical extremists who see themselves as trying to strike a mortal blow at our structure. Having said that, they are doing quite well, thank you very much, on using conventional terrorism. And on their own--and I don't have access to classified intelligence on this matter. The technological, scientific resource matters that are necessary really would require cooperation of a state provision, such as Iraq, and that to me is a very important area to be zeroing in on human intelligence on the connections between Iraq and the bin Laden group. Mr. Shays. Do you have any comment on that? Is that an uncomfortable statement to have made? Mr. Decker. I don't think it is uncomfortable. With what we just experienced, I think it is accurate. Mr. Shays. Dr. Post, you had said weapons of mass destruction is not a helpful term because they can be used not as weapons of mass destruction, or they wouldn't most likely-- -- Dr. Post. The so-called weapons of mass destruction can be used in small attacks, and you can cause mass destruction with conventional terrorism. So I think it is semantically confusing. Mr. Shays. You don't see a distinction between a chemical, biological---- Dr. Post. That is CBRN terrorism, and it does have its own terrorizing aspects, the so-called silent death, but it is not useful--because it conjures up the spectacle of the superterrorism, and, in fact, the much more likely use would be a small local attack. Mr. Shays. I was born in , years old by . We then started to--we had the cold war--excuse me, the conventional World War I, II concept of confrontation gave way to the cold war, and there was a whole redefinition of how we responded. We ended up with--I am going to put a reward out for Dr. Alibek. And anybody gets him gets $ from me if you get him in the next minutes, and that is a promise you can bank on. But the cold war began. And we then--I am trying to think of, you know, is there some parallels to then and now. I had people tell me they thought cities would literally be blown up. I lived in a community in Fairfield County--Jason, you get $ . I want to get you on your way, but I just wanted to say and I am going to ask you, Dr. Alibek, this question. It can be a yes, if it is a yes or no. I just say that it is not a question if there is going to be a chemical or biological attack, but a question of not if, but when, where and of what magnitude, and the magnitude is the thing we talked about most likely to be small in nature, not large in nature. Is that an uncomfortable statement, a statement you would agree with or disagree? Mr. Alibek. I would answer this way now---- Mr. Shays. I want a yes or no first. Would you agree or disagree. If you don't agree, tell me. Mr. Alibek. I agree. Mr. Shays. Now qualify. Mr. Alibek. Of course, we will be seeing newer and newer cases of anthrax or some other infections. And we know, for example, today's case in New York, new information has come in about a new case of anthrax. But we will be going from small cases, and probably later we will be seeing a bigger number of cases of various infections. Mr. Shays. And all of the three of you agree with Dr. Post except as not surprising there is no red line anymore, no red line meaning no limit to what they would be willing to do. Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, there is no red line. Mr. Shays. You are not surprised by it? Mr. Parachini. Well, I guess I would want to texture that a little more, because I think that the motivations, for example, are more than just an audience of one and it being God. It is not just religion. There is a patina of religion here, but it's other things. They talk about political things. And indeed, bin Laden in his recent statement has done that, as did Ramzi Yousef on the stand in New York. Here's the part where I think it differs a little bit from there being no red lines. They see themselves as cosmic warriors engaged in a great struggle, and in order to continue that struggle which gives them meaning, they have to stay alive, or some of them have to stay alive. And so they are willing to do a lot, but it is not that there is no red line, it's that they're willing to do what it is to fight in this cosmic struggle. Mr. Shays. In fact, the red line is way off in the distance. Mr. Parachini. I don't think they think about a red line at all. And so by putting a red line out there, we are imposing how we think that they'd crash on through it. Mr. Shays. In a sense you said yes, and it's an interesting way of qualifying. You said you wanted to add texture to it. I'm learning every day from you guys. I know my colleague Mr. Platts wants to ask a question. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have two questions, and as a nonscientist kind of lay person on these issues trying to get a good understanding of the threats and the various aspects of these various biological weapons--the potential for it, earlier this week I sat in on a briefing with a doctor from John Hopkins and their civilian biodefense center, and when he talked about smallpox and the threats of that being used by terrorists and it spreading, one of the things he said was that a good nature--and the symptoms, I think, was days of very intense fevers followed by the onset of the rash, and that his statement to us was that a person is not contagious until the onset of the rash. And, Dr. Alibek, in your testimony, you talk about it being contagious before any symptoms are visible. And I'd be interested if you could expand it. Mr. Alibek. You know, it's one of the biggest disagreements between Dr. Henderson and myself. He considers smallpox becomes contagious when we see the onset of this infection. Unfortunately, we have seen many cases when monkeys became infectious on the last day of incubation period, and it was absolutely the same observation from the scientists who visited India and some other countries when they dealt with smallpox in those countries. This infection becomes contagious the day before the onset of these symptoms. Mr. Platts. That is based on your studies in Russia? Mr. Alibek. Based on all observations and based on new study. Mr. Platts. Well, I think that is an important aspect because of---- Mr. Alibek. This is the only contagious infection in which people become contagious before the onset of symptoms. Mr. Platts. OK. Thank you. From how to be able to address it, it emphasizes the importance of an immediate response as opposed to having a day or or days' kind of cushion to be able to respond. Mr. Alibek. You know, it is an interesting question, for example, when we analyze all scientific literature here in the United States regarding smallpox, you know what kind of information you find? You know, a very small general description of smallpox. Russia has studied smallpox for years from various aspects, especially keeping in mind that Russia, the Soviet Union, was involved in developing smallpox biological weapons for decades. In this case, a number of cases, a number of observations was much greater than here in the United States. And, you know, it is in many Russian sources. For example, if you analyze Russian sources, you can find this specific statement: Infection, this infection becomes contagious before the onset of symptoms. Mr. Platts. Thank you. Second question was for any of the panelist members who would like to address it is what other aspects of Dr. Henderson's testimony was the difficulty--and it has been reported in the press of it being very difficult to take a crop-dusting plane and adjust it to have such a fine mist that would be the serious threat. He contended in his statements to us that it is not true, that it would be very easy to kind of retrofit, to basically change some valves to make the crop- dusting plane very much a means of disbursing the biological element in a very effective way, and I had been interested in any opinions. Dr. Post. It is my understanding that one needs to make a distinction between an urban area and tall buildings, and in order to get the adequate concentration down, it would be quite problematic. I do want to raise what my initial reaction was to this just to add a totally different element. I found it very interesting that these inquiries occurred in a rather indiscrete fashion, in fact just before the event when they were going to give their lives. My initial question was, was this done, in fact, to create terror, knowing---- Mr. Platts. Psychological aspect of it? Dr. Post [continuing]. That they would be discovered, and was this part of a larger plan? I just raise this as an additional thought. Mr. Alibek. What is interesting, I agree with Dr. Henderson, when somebody says it is very difficult just to redevelop nozzles of crop dusters and just to have the right particle size, you know, in my opinion, it's incorrect. When we water the grass at our houses, there are some systems just to create mist. It is a very simple nozzle system. When we say it is very difficult to have biological agents in the right particle, it's a matter of just a specific nozzle device. And in this case, if this--usually crop dusters deploy biopesticides or pesticides--a regular particle size. Settling was in between , microns. When we talk about biological weapons deployment, this particle size must be between to microns. Some people say to . It's incorrect. Up to microns could work. It would cause different manifestations of infections. But microns work as well. And in this case, what I would like to say, one of the types of deployment in the Soviet Union for operation of biological weapons was to use medium-range bombers with spray tanks. In each spray tank, to capacity each, it had specially developed nozzles just to create this means. And, you know, crop dusters operate on the same principle. Mr. Platts. You are saying that you are agreeing with Dr. Henderson that it would be easily done? Mr. Alibek. He said it would be easy, and I agree it is not a technically unsolvable problem. Mr. Parachini. If I can just add, the Iraqis worked on this for a number of years and were not successful. We have to look into the future and hedge against that possibility, but let us keep in perspective the difficulty here. Mr. Alibek. We worked on this problem, and we used anthrax over the Virginia Islands using these medium-range bombers, and the effectiveness of this deployment was unbelievable. And in , deployment of tuleremia of--by American military showed with the right particle size was able to travel tens of miles and infect and kill monkeys , miles downwind. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, my thanks to all the panelists for their testimony. Mr. Shays. Dr. Decker, a housekeeping issue here. If we are trying to assess the threat assessment, part of that is do they have the capability, say, of delivering a chemical or biological agent. That would be part of the threat assessment, right? Mr. Decker. That's correct. Mr. Shays. Or a threat assessment, for instance, of radioactive material would be do they have radioactive material; or nuclear weapons, do they have a nuclear weapon? Mr. Decker. And other aspects of that, that's correct. Dr. Post. If I might add something worth noting in terms of threat assessment, one would like to know--and this is a human intelligence question--has this group been recruiting biochemists, or has it been recruiting inorganic chemists. Has it been trying to get into its cadre of specialists the kinds of scientists who could promote this. This would be one of the kinds of indicators one would look for that a group is making a transition from conventional terrorism to being really motivated to pursue bioterrorism. Mr. Shays. In a briefing we had yesterday, we had Eileen Pricer, who argues that we don't have the data we need because we don't take all the public data that is available and mix it with the security data. And just taking public data, using, you know, computer systems that are high-speed and able to digest, you know, literally floors' worth of material, she can take relationships that are seven times removed, seven units removed, and when she does that, she ends up with relationships to the bin Laden group where she sees the purchase of chemicals, the sending of students to universities. You wouldn't see it if you isolated it there, but if that unit is connected to that unit, which is connected to that unit, which is connected to that unit, you then see the relationship. So we don't know ultimately the authenticity of how she does it, but when she does it, she comes up with the kind of answer that you have just asked, which is a little unsettling. I just have a few areas of interest here, but I want to--my staff wants to make sure that I ask one question, and I am going to keep them on edge and wait to ask that question later. Makes them pay attention. Forty offices, , employees-- , employees would fill up a stadium. That is a lot of people. Mr. Alibek. Correct. Mr. Shays. They were all working on biological weapons and defensive ways to defend? Mr. Alibek. The great majority of them were working in two fields, biological weapons offensive issues and biological weapons defensive issues. Mr. Shays. And defensive, in your words, are what would happen---- Mr. Alibek. To development of treatment, of vaccines, and just to protect against biological infectious diseases. Mr. Shays. In the process of doing your work, were there occasions where people became inflicted with a particular disease and died? Mr. Alibek. Yes. We had some cases. Mr. Shays. You had casualties. Mr. Alibek. But you know what we were able to do because there were two major systems to develop biological weapons. Minister of Defense had a great number of people who died because they started this program in the 's and 's. Mr. Shays. When your unit was established after the Department of Defense, were you the civilian side of this? Mr. Alibek. We were a completely new entity, specifically established to develop modern, sophisticated biological weapons. Mr. Shays. This is a matter of public record, and I should know it, so I don't want to spend a lot of time, but it's going to get me to a question. Is this operation still going on? Mr. Alibek. The Minister of Defense is still having facilities, but this system, Biopreparat, has been dismantled. Mr. Shays. You have , people give or take. Mr. Alibek. Many of them have left Biopreparat facilities. And where these people are, it is very difficult to say. Mr. Shays. We are not talking about people, but , . Mr. Alibek. But at least people with sophisticated knowledge, a number is about , to , people. Mr. Shays. That is a staggering number. Mr. Alibek. Nobody knows where these people are. Mr. Shays. Now, in terms of the biological agents, did you come across some delivery systems that would be very helpful to the terrorists, or did you hit a wall where you just simply couldn't deliver a biological agent effectively? Mr. Alibek. No. Everything was developed. There are three major delivery systems for deployment because it was a military program. Mr. Shays. I don't need to know them. I just want to know if you did them. Mr. Alibek. We were able to develop very effective, sophisticated deployment techniques and means for deployment. Mr. Shays. Now, some--obviously, if they are military, the tip of a missile, that's one thing, but were some of them more subtle so they would be a means that would be a tool that a terrorist could use? Mr. Alibek. Some of them, at least percent of this technique, could be used by terrorists. Mr. Shays. Give me on a scale of to , being confident that terrorists have these weapons to that they don't. Where would you put it, being most likely that they had them, or at least the states--let's just go to the states, the Koreas, the Chinas, the Irans, the Iraqs, the Libyas. Mr. Alibek. Nine, ten. Mr. Shays. So, then, all I have to decide is if I think those countries have them, it's possible the terrorists have them. And I know what I think. Mr. Alibek. I'm talking about the countries. If you are talking about terrorist groups, it is difficult to say. Mr. Shays. We will all come to our conclusion. Dr. Post. On that question, might I note, though, the observation was made, terrorists are mobile and hard to trace where states are confined within their borders. The risk to a state of retaliation for it being discovered that it was providing these weapons to a terrorist group is certainly profound, and that will be a major--I am not saying it will stop providing them, but it certainly is a major disincentive for any state. Mr. Shays. The only problem with Afghanistan, for instance, if you believe the story yesterday, I mean, the Taliban and bin Laden are basically one and the same, if you accept that. This is--my major other area of questioning and I will get to the question the staff wants me to ask--well, let me do it now, the BWC, Biological Weapons Convention, did not stop the Soviet Union from developing biological weapons. The Soviets signed the BWC; is that correct? Mr. Alibek. That's correct. It was signed by the Soviet Union, but it didn't stop. It even expanded the Soviet Union's biological weapons program. Mr. Shays. And I don't believe, but I would be curious, do you think there is a way you can write a protocol to inspect all potential places where you would make a biological agent, or do you think that you could still have secret places that no one would ever know about? Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, it is impossible. Mr. Shays. Impossible? Mr. Alibek. Impossible, because these protocols would never be able to inspect all possible locations and all possible productionsites. Mr. Shays. And on a timely basis. Mr. Alibek. It is not just this issue. For example, the Soviet Union, as soon as that country started understanding that United States will be pressuring the Soviet Union severely, they started developing mobile installations for manufacturing and assembling biological weapons. Mr. Shays. Then let me just ask this question here. Do you think that the smallpox is still a Vector or--let me put it this way. This is what I have to sort out, and all of you can jump in. You basically had smallpox theoretically that was the WHO--that is the United States plus the Soviet Union--just those two and the WHO. But you have the United States theoretically and the Soviet Union have it, CDC and Vector. I don't know why other doctors who were dealing with the smallpox efforts to cure it, why they wouldn't have theoretically all abided by the request to destroy it. But my question to you is, are you totally and completely comfortable that smallpox is contained within Vector and nowhere else? Mr. Alibek. Absolutely not. I strongly believe that there are some countries who have secret stocks of this virus. And specifically we knew North Korea was experimenting with smallpox in late 's, early 's. And we knew that Iraq was experimenting with camelpox as a good surrogate for---- Mr. Shays. You said Iraq? Mr. Alibek. Camelpox is a good surrogate to model a smallpox infection. This is just what we know for sure. But in my opinion, there could be some other countries still having smallpox stocks. Mr. Shays. Which gets me to this question--and all of you could jump in as well in terms of your perspective on it--if I am asked, you know, by someone from the press or constituents what can they do--in other words, I know what the government can do to deal with the threat and the likelihood of a biological attack. I think I know what my government can do. I want my government to obviously have the proper threat assessment, to know the likelihood of when, where and what magnitude, and if we can determine that. I would like them to know potentially what kind of biological agent would be used, you know. And I guess that would be based on percentages, Mr. Decker, I mean, this more likely than that, but--is that a yes? Mr. Decker. I think there would be some attempt to quantify which one would be more probable, but that is problematic in itself. Mr. Shays. So then my question is, the best answer I have is that I want my government to have the antibiotics to deal with this and potentially the vaccines where a vaccine would be helpful. Like with anthrax it would be helpful even after someone has contracted the disease, with the antibiotics. But what else can the government do? Is it just prevention, or can we deal with it when it happens? Mr. Alibek. My position again, vaccines--I don't believe vaccines are good protection against bioterrorism. What the government needs to do is to liberate all possible protection and treatment approaches and just to start paying much attention to treatment, to medical treatment and to emergency prophylaxes. Not much has been done in this field. Mr. Shays. More on treatment than a prophylactic. Mr. Alibek. More on treatment and emergency prophylaxes. Mr. Shays. Is that based on your belief there can't be immunity from a biological attack? Mr. Alibek. Not just my belief, our experimental data suggests there are some directions, very promising directions, could be liberated and could result in appropriate protective means and approaches against biological weapons. Mr. Shays. I misunderstand you. I say a prophylactic. Can you vaccinate someone for all the potential biological agents? Mr. Alibek. When we say prophylaxes, there are two types of prophylaxes: first, vaccine prophylaxes and, second, urgent prophylaxes. It means---- Mr. Shays. When it happens---- Mr. Alibek. You can use it either immediately before or after exposure. There are different means and approaches to do this. In this case, keeping in mind that the number of agents being used in biological weapons is big--I would say large--it is very, very difficult to imagine that vaccines would have any volume in this case. But there are many scientific approaches and many scientific developments already. For example, you can talk to DARPA, and they can tell you about the immunological approaches they develop. In my opinion, there is a very good direction funded by DARPA. But there is another problem. Since we started developing vaccines here in this country and in many other countries, we lost a huge number of scientists who understand infectious diseases, infectious diseases per se, and, I mean, we have got a huge number of microbiologists, but we have no many scientists who can deal with infectious disease. Mr. Shays. In the United States and Europe? Mr. Alibek. Unfortunately, yes. We need to revise this issue, and we need to develop a new level of scientists, virologists, bacteriologists and experts in infectious diseases. Mr. Shays. I would like to have counsel ask a question. Mr. Halloran. Just in anthrax cases, the island--or not an island, but the island of Anthrax in the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan, what can you tell us about the anthrax that's there? What is the likelihood that it's still virulent; that if a terrorist from Afghanistan wanted to walk up there with a scoop and grab some anthrax, what's the likelihood that it's still virulent and would be useful to a terrorist? Mr. Alibek. You know, this island in Aral Sea--Russian name of this island was Virginia Island. It was the Soviet Union bioweapon proving testing ground. It has been used to test different biological weapons including the plague, tuberculosis Glanders and anthrax. The entire island is contaminated, completely contaminated. You can dig in and isolate spores of anthrax. They are still virulent, and they could be used if there is a group having access to this island. It wouldn't be a big problem to isolate virulent strains of anthrax from that island. Mr. Halloran. The island is not guarded? Mr. Alibek. You can come and have just a very simple protection, spray-type suits; just a simple protection, including gloves, masks and just having simple equipment just to take samples in petri dishes and just to see on the surfaces of petri dishes and then separate colonies, and you've got enough material just for growing. Mr. Halloran. And the expertise required to identify a lethal strain, is that undergraduate, postgraduate? Mr. Alibek. Undergraduate. I would say this: A level enough--in many cases it is not a matter, for example, of graduating or master's degree knowledge. It is a matter of commitment and specific desire, specific knowledge. You have a basic training in biology, but if you commit to a personal group, you will be able to retrieve this information from many sources available in the world. In this case, for example, if you know how to grow microorganisms and you know how to identify--because it is a simple process--with how to identify a virulent strain. People think in many cases it is necessary to infect animals, but if they know that virulent strains have capsule and they know how to grow, how take a sample or prepare a slide and just staining the slide and see a capsule, you know it is a virulent strain. Mr. Shays. Let me close by asking, is there any question you would like to ask yourself that you wished I had asked or some other Member asked? Seriously. Is there a question we should have asked? Mr. Parachini. I would just urge the committee at some point in its deliberations to think through the link between the state programs and terrorists, because at the moment there is no open source information to show that evidence. And indeed, the numbers about the number of people involved in former state programs who may be around the world are in a fair amount of dispute. We've heard very large numbers here, but there are many other views about what the number is and where those people are, most of whom are in Western countries, most of whom are in the United States. So that gauge, the threat requires a little more discussion. Mr. Shays. You don't want me to assume that if Iraq has chemical agents, that the terrorists who have worked in Iraq have them? Mr. Parachini. That's right. That would be one thing, and also the former Soviet agents or former Soviet scientists, given the size of all the number of people that worked in the program, only a much smaller number actually had weapons, critical knowledge, and many of them have come here and have not gone to North Korea, Iraq or Iran. So getting the dimension of the potential threat is an important thing to run at. Mr. Shays. Seems to me we can't do it until we have that. I make the assumption, admittedly based on all the hearings that we have had, that it is so likely as to be almost absurd not to think they haven't gotten them, but your point is, I haven't seen the money. But we have people who have made it very clear to us that pathetically that resources from the former Soviet Union to various countries went for a song, that they didn't pay a lot of money for some of what they got. And one of the things that concerns me--one of the things that has concerned me has been--I am sorry. I lost my train of thought, and I just want to get this point--that you have various republics where you had nuclear programs in countries other than now Russia. Do I make the assumption that all the chemical programs were in the Russia Federation, or were some of them in now what are independent states, independent countries? Mr. Alibek. Now, when we talk about, not chemical, biological weapons program, apart--this program was located actually in three former Soviet Union republics. The major part was in Russia. A small part was in Kazakhstan, and the third part was in Uzbekistan. Mr. Shays. That shouldn't make me feel good, should it? Mr. Alibek. Yeah. But when we say how many people knew, know, and where these people are, what I would like to say I know because---- Mr. Shays. Short answer. Mr. Alibek. I am having some Russian scientists working for me previously involved in Russian biological weapons program. They've got contacts with Russian scientists who visited Iran and Iraq and taught in Iran and Iraq, and they told these people who were in those countries, told that at least Iranian scientists had very sophisticated knowledge in molecular biology. They were there. Mr. Shays. I hear you loud and clear. Mr. Parachini. The link I am trying to make is between the terrorist group and the state. Mr. Shays. I think it is fair. Dr. Post. And just to add and echo this point, that is a huge, important intelligence target to be looking at that link, which we at this point in time scarcely have adequately covered. It is a human intelligence problem. Mr. Shays. Let me say to you I think this has been a wonderful panel, and I appreciate the moments when you were listening to others and then moments when you were the key player. If one of you wasn't here, this panel would not have been as helpful. It was the various contributions that you all made. And I hope our paths cross again. Very, very valuable information, and I appreciate it a lot. Thank you very much. This hearing is closed. [Whereupon, at p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] - "

(PART II) ---------- THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER , House of Representatives, subcommittee on Domestic Policy, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at : p.m., in room , Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dennis J. Kucinich (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Kucinich, Watson, and Towns. Staff present: Jaron R. Bourke, staff director; and Justin Baker, clerk/policy analyst. Mr. Kucinich. Good afternoon. The subcommittee will come to order. I want to note that usually we're joined by many Members of Congress, but late last night they had a get-out-of-dodge moment. And most Members are now back in their home constituency, a place that I intend to be in a few hours. But I am very pleased that all of you are here for this important hearing. The Subcommittee on Domestic Policy on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is now in order. Today's hearing is the second day of the first hearing held by Congress to examine the environmental impact of the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds in fields growing genetically engineered herbicide resistant crops. But for years, farmers have struggled with the impact. Across the Midwest and south, farmers growing Roundup Ready soy, corn and cotton have been encountering more and more kinds of weeds that Roundup herbicide cannot control. That weed resistance costs farmers money and causes them to resort to more and more toxic pesticides. Please look at the monitors for an excerpt from an ABC News segment that ran last year. Staff, play that segment. [Video shown.] Mr. Kucinich. Thank you. What responsibility for preventing and lessening the environmental impact of Roundup-resistant weeds and the consequent impact on farmers does the Federal Government have? Today we will hear from government regulators and others on that question. Now without objection, I'm going to continue with an opening statement of minutes, any Member or witness who wishes to submit a written statement or extraneous materials for the record will have legislative days to do so, without objection. And in our previous hearing in July, we heard from weed scientists that Roundup-resistant weeds have infested between and million acres of prime farmland in the southeast and Midwest. Mr. Chairman, welcome. This is the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Towns. Thank you for being here. While a phenomenon of natural selection for herbicide resistant--resistance is not new, the acceleration in a number of resistant weed species, and especially the infested acreage, is new. And it's been caused by the commercialization of multiple Roundup-resistant crop systems. In only the last decade, eight or nine species of weeds have rapidly evolved resistance to Roundup in herbicide resistant crop fields. Indeed, Roundup resistance in weeds has been known since the year when Roundup-resistant horseweed, a weed species that had not been previously resistant to Roundup, was discovered in Roundup-Ready crop fields in Delaware. While scientists have validated what farmers were discovering in their fields, the Nation's lead regulator of genetically engineered crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has been looking the other way. Every time a pesticide company petitioned the USDA to deregulate a new herbicide-tolerant variety of crop, USDA determined that the introduction of the new crop would have ``No significant impact'' on the farming environment. But recently the Department's indifference to the indirect consequences of their deregulation of Roundup-resistant crops has caught the attention of two Federal District Court judges. They independently struck down the USDA's deregulation of Roundup- Ready alfalfa, and Roundup-Ready sugar beets. They found USDA to have unreasonably and arbitrarily dismiss the environmental consequences of deregulating genetically engineered crops. In one instance, the judge found that USDA could produce no written record that it had ever considered the impact on farmers. Nevertheless, Roundup- resistant weeds are hurting farmers. They are imposing $ billion in additional weed control costs. They threaten cotton growing so profoundly that they've been compared to the boll weevil. And the solution may be worse than the problem. To combat Roundup-resistant weed proliferation, the pesticide industry recommends to farmers that they use more and more toxic pesticides on newly engineered crops that will be tolerant of those more toxic pesticides. That will surely lead to more environmental pollution, and, as we shall see, the collateral damage of crop destruction, and even more costs to farmers. In today's hearing, we will show that the USDA's passivity lies in stark contrast to the EPA's active approach in preventing pest resistance to genetically engineered crops it regulates. We will show that the USDA's legal authority is no less broad than EPA's legal authority. However, USDA views its broad authority much too narrowly, while EPA used its broad authority appropriately. Which approach has the better track record? Passive and self-constrained, USDA's approach has plainly allowed the proliferation of herbicide-resistant weeds. In contrast, EPA's record of prevention is a relative success. Perhaps we are at a crossroads for USDA's policy of passivity toward superweeds, having been reversed by two Federal judges with scores of farmers needing relief from the cost and consequences of superweeds. And with a new administration determining policy at the Department, it may finally be the time there for the Department of Agriculture to reexamine its approach to the deregulation of the genetically engineered crops, and to make a change in policy. It should be a change that would help prevent the proliferation of herbicide resistant weeds. It should be a change that would preserve efficacy of a relatively benign herbicide. It should be a change that would deescalate the trend to more and more toxic pesticides. It should be a change that would pass muster with Federal courts. It should be a change that would protect the long-term interest of farmers, consumers and the natural environment. The chair recognizes the distinguished chair of the full committee, Mr. Towns of New York. I appreciate your being here, Mr. Towns, and I appreciate the leadership that you provide on the full committee. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dennis J. Kucinich follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Towns. I want to thank you, first of all, for holding this hearing. I want to thank the witnesses for being here. And I know that you realize the importance of it because the Congress is not even in session, and of course this hearing is still taking place because of the importance of it. And of course, I want to just thank my colleague for moving forward with it because, let's face it, this is a very, very important hearing and I think that sometimes we forget all about it in terms of how important it is in terms of farming and something that we sort of pushed aside. I think it was Mr. Louis Perry, a cotton grower in Georgia whose family has been farming since , told a reporter that herbicide resistant pigweed posed a lethal threat to cotton farming in Georgia. I mean, it talks about in terms of how important it is, so if we don't whip this thing, it's going to be like the boll weevil as it was pointed out. Of course, we have to make certain that we stay on top of it and stay focused. I want to thank the gentleman who comes from an urban area that understands how important this is and spending time and focusing on it. So I want to let you know that from the full committee standpoint, we stand ready to support you in every way, but I'm happy to know that you're getting the message out, because it's important that we do so. So again, thank you for taking time to be here even when the House is not in session, because you felt it was important to continue without cancellation and I want to salute you for that. Thank you and I yield back. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much for being here, Mr. Chairman. I want you to know that--well, it's true that I'm in a primarily urban area. There are a few small farms in the southern part of my district. But I became aware of this, in part, through meeting with farmers across the country during the time that I was campaigning nationally for the Democratic nomination. So I have had the chance to actually be on farms, talk to farmers about their concerns about the issues that are raised in this hearing today. There are no additional opening statements, so our subcommittee is going to receive testimony from the witnesses before us today. I would like to start by introducing our panel. The Honorable Ann Wright, Deputy Under Secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Previously, she served as senior policy advisor to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, on Agriculture Committee matters. Before joining the staff of Senator Reid, she was a lobbyist for Consumer's Union on energy and trade issues. Previously she worked with farmers and nonprofit organizations at the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition in Washington, DC, and served as a policy advisor on agriculture issues for Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. Mr. Sid Abel, is the assistant deputy administrator for biotechnology regulatory service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. In this role, he helps provide oversight of risk-based introductions of regulated genetically engineered biotechnology crops, as well as conducting and providing oversight of broad environmental risk and impact assessments complaint with the National Environmental Policy Act. Prior to this, he served as the associate director with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Pesticide Programs. He worked for the EPA in various capacities from to . Mr. Abel will not deliver testimony, but will be available to answer subcommittee members' questions. The Honorable James J. Jones is the principal deputy assistant administrator of the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. He is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the office, which implements the Nation's pesticide toxic chemical and pollution prevention laws. The Office has an annual budget of over $ million, more than , employees. From to Mr. Jones served as a director of the office of pesticide programs. In this role he was responsible for the regulation of pesticides in the United States with a budget of approximately $ million and employees, making it the largest EPA headquarters program office. I want to thank each of the witnesses for appearing before the subcommittee. It is the policy of our Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to swear in all witnesses before they testify. Now Mr. Able, even though you're not making an opening statement, I'm going to ask if you would agree to be sworn because your answers to your questions will put your testimony on the record. And I would ask that all the witnesses rise. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Kucinich. Let the record reflect that each of the witnesses has answered in the affirmative. I ask that each witness give an oral summary of his or her testimony to keep the summary under minutes in duration. Your complete written statement is going to be included in the record. So what we want in minutes is to try to get a sense of what you want to communicate to this committee. I would like to begin with Ann Wright, the first witness on the panel, please begin. STATEMENTS OF ANN WRIGHT, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE; SID ABEL, ASSISTANT DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, BIOTECHNOLOGY REGULATORY SERVICE, ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE; AND JIM JONES, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF CHEMICAL SAFETY AND POLLUTION PREVENTION, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY STATEMENT OF ANN WRIGHT Ms. Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss USDA's biotechnology regulatory programs and the issue of herbicide- resistant weeds. First, I would like to emphasize that at USDA, we support all forms of agriculture, including conventional, genetically engineered and organic crops to meet the Nation's and world's needs for security, energy production and the economic sustainability of farms. All three of those methods of production must be strong and viable. As the world population increases, the demand for food is growing and the land available to farm is shrinking. We need innovative agriculture production systems to not only to maintain the competitiveness of the United States, but also to fulfill growing food needs. Biotechnology is just one tool to address those needs, but it's a critical one. USDA's role in regulating the products of biotechnology is carried out in coordination with EPA and FDA. Through the Plant Protection Act, our animal, plant health inspection service regulates those products that may pose a plant pest risk, while EPA and FDA use their authorities to address the safety of our food supply and the safe use of pesticides. USDA's biotechnology regulatory program, which has been in place since , is rigorous and science based. Since the program began we have effectively overseen nearly , field trials at , locations and deregulated over products. While our current biotechnology regulations have been effective in insuring the safe introduction of GE organisms, we are constantly learning from our experiences, reforming and refining our first rate program to protect American agriculture and the environment. As part of those refinements, we are always looking at ways to improve our program. Chief among these is our effort to update our biotechnology regulations. USDA is examining the policy issue raised in over , comments that were submitted on our proposed regulations, with the goal of better positioning the agency to address new challenges while meeting current needs. Our biotechnology program has evolved as the number of environmental issues to be considered under NEPA has grown as well as in response to several NEPA-related lawsuits. At the same time, it's important to remember that we have made thousands of regulatory decisions without legal challenge, and just as important, not one of our plant pest risk determinations have been overturned in court. You also asked me to discuss how USDA approaches herbicide- resistant weeds in relation to GE crops. A key point is that while the consideration of the herbicide resistance in weeds under NEPA informs our decisionmaking, and we are fully committed to meeting our NEPA obligations, USDA's biotechnology regulatory decisions are ultimately based on plant pest risk, consistent with our authority under the Plant Protection Act. It is also important to note that the development of herbicide resistance among weeds is natural and an evolutionary process. It is not exclusively associated with GE crops, and that GE crops provide many benefits, such as reduced pesticide use and decreased soil erosion thanks to no till farming. And we want to preserve those benefits. We must also be cognizant that if we limit the use of herbicide tolerant crops, farmers will likely have to return to older, less environmentally friendly weed control methods. Because herbicide resistance is an important issue for the agricultural community, USDA has multiple agencies engaged on the issue through research and education, as well as partnerships with outside groups and other Federal agencies. For instance, our National Institutes of Food and Agriculture's Competitive Grants Program provided $ . million in research for the biology of weedy invasive species. Further NIFA's extension outreach programs provide the connection between scientific research and its application on farms, the training sessions, field days and other outreach to growers. USDA's Agricultural Research Service has nearly $ . million in herbicide resistant weed research in fiscal year , which is part of $ million it's dedicating to all weed science issues this year. And APHIS is partnered with the EPA and the Weed Science Society of America to better understand the extent of herbicide resistance in managed ecosystems as well as the methods being used to manage herbicide resistance in weeds. We are fully committed to working with our partners to identify potential solutions and alternative techniques to address herbicide resistance. This will require a coordinated effort by everyone involved, the government, Congress, researchers, the agricultural community, technology and crop protection companies, and public interest groups. At USDA, we are looking at the broader context of herbicide resistance beyond just its relation to biotechnology. We look forward to working with our partners, including all in Congress. Together we are confident that we can find solutions that make sense. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, thank you again for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to answering your questions.

I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of transgenic B.t. crops, as well as EPA's involvement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and their assessments of the environmental impact of herbicide-tolerant crops and herbicide-resistant weeds. Under the coordinated framework for the regulation of biotechnology, EPA regulates products produced through biotechnology that are intended to have a pesticidal effect under its authorities under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. EPA first registered a transgenic B.t. crop in . Over the past years, B.t. crops have substantially reduced the need for growers to apply older, more risky conventional chemical pesticides to corn and cotton crops. Because sprayable B.t. formulations are naturally derived organic pesticides, they are very important to organic farmers. Given the importance of this technology to organic agricultural as well as the favorable environmental profile of B.t. as a pesticide, EPA has, from the very beginning of its regulation of transgenic B.t. crops, required registrants to market these products with specific mandatory insect-resistant management requirements. EPA would consider the development of insect resistance to B.t. toxins to constitute and adverse effect on the environment. These IRM requirements have evolved as the science has evolved, and we have altered and tailored the IRM requirements to match the latest and most relevant scientific data and information. The USDA regulates genetically engineered herbicide- tolerant crops, while EPA regulates the herbicides used on these crops. In order to coordinate our reviews in , the agencies developed a Memorandum of Understanding that outlined the Agency's respective roles. In , responding to increases in reported cases of resistance, EPA and USDA held discussions on the extent to which herbicide-resistant weeds were occurring in the herbicide-tolerant crops. As a result of these discussions, the EPA and USDA initiated a project with the Weed Science Society of America to develop a comprehensive manuscript to better understand the scope of herbicide resistance in genetically engineered, and non genetically engineered cropping systems. The report is due later this year. As glyphosate-resistant weeds have become more widespread in herbicide-tolerant crops, technology providers and users have become more open to efforts to address herbicide-resistant weeds. The support for resistance management from technology providers and users has spurred the development of strategies to prevent or manage herbicide-resistant weeds in herbicide- tolerant crops. EPA and USDA are working with researchers and professional societies to expand resistance management education and promote research aimed at increasing the understanding of the best practices and strategies for preventing and managing herbicide- tolerant weeds. EPA is also working with pesticide registrants encouraging them to include mechanism of action information on herbicide labels. This information is critical to the implementation of resistance management plans, which typically involve rotation of two herbicides with different mechanism of action as a proven strategy for preventing or delaying development of resistance. Recently, EPA and USDA have reinvigorated our efforts in this area to promote resistance management in herbicide- tolerant crops and preserve this valuable technology. We look forward to working with this committee, our fellow agencies, our stakeholders in the public, to ensure an environmentally and economically healthy country for all Americans. Thank you, and I'd be pleased to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Jones follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much. I would like to begin the first round of questions with Ms. Wright. As you know, the USDA, since they began deregulating Roundup-Ready Corn, Soy And cotton, among other genetically engineered herbicide-resistant crops in the late 's, weed scientists estimate that there are up to million acres of American farmland, and a dozen species of weeds that have evolved to be resistant to Roundup herbicide. The result for farmers has been greatly increased cost of weed management, and a probable loss of Roundup as an efficacious weed control chemical in large parts of the country. Is it the position of the USDA that it could not regulate genetically engineered herbicide-resistant crops in order to prevent this spread of herbicide-resistant weeds? Ms. Wright. Mr. Chairman, USDA recognizes the development of herbicide-resistant weeds across the board. Mr. Kucinich. What does that mean? Ms. Wright. It means that we recognize it as probably the No. issue for farmers and ranchers whether they are raising crops using biotechnology, or organic, or conventional seed. I think we have a number of ways that we're looking at this through our active and dedicated research programs that are looking at critical national priorities like the sustainable production of bioenergy climate change, global food security. We continue to see this issue as critical to farmers bottom lines. And right now, we have confidence in a science-based process that regulates in and around our plant protection authorities, our statutory commitments are to that act. Mr. Kucinich. Well, you know, that's very interesting, but the question that I asked is, is it your position that the USDA could not regulate genetically engineered herbicide-resistant crops in order to prevent the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds? Ms. Wright. That's correct. Our statutory authority allows us to make regulatory decisions based on plant pest risk. Mr. Kucinich. Tell me more about that. Ms. Wright. Well, what I can tell you is that the plant pest risk is determined by--well, I'm going to let---- Mr. Kucinich. Let me go to Mr. Jones a minute. Mr. Jones, the EPA has taken a different position. EPA believed that it could regulate one genetically engineered plant variety in particular, those containing the B.t. or the Bacillus thuringiensis gene in order to prevent the development of pest resistance to B.t.; is that correct? Mr. Jones. That's correct. We're operating under a different statute, in this case, FIFRA. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Jones, I understand the EPA's been regulating B.t. crops to prevent pest resistance for about years. Is there a problem with B.t. resistance in this country comparable to the problem of Roundup resistance in weeds? Mr. Jones. There is not. Mr. Kucinich. Pardon? Mr. Jones. No, there is not. Mr. Kucinich. Are there million acres of B.t. resistant farmland right now? Mr. Jones. We're not aware of resistance yet---- Mr. Kucinich. How many acres of American farmland has been infested with B.t. resistant pests? Mr. Jones. We're not aware of any. It doesn't mean there isn't some. Mr. Kucinich. Well, is B.t. still an efficacious pesticide in the United States? Mr. Jones. It is. Mr. Kucinich. Does it concern EPA to learn that weed resistance to Roundup is now widely prevalent? Mr. Jones. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. If so, why? Mr. Jones. Glyphosate to Roundup is--has a very favorable, as you mentioned in your opening remarks, environmental profile. And so it's a compound that we think it's in the interests of the environment to have a long commercial life. Mr. Kucinich. So your saying that it's because the glyphosate is relatively benign? Mr. Jones. It has a very favorable environmental profile. Mr. Kucinich. Ms. Wright, million acres of infested farmland, $ billion in added weed control costs to farmers. The loss of efficacy for a relatively benign pesticide in many places, these are some of the consequences of the USDA's position that it could not regulate Roundup Ready crops to prevent the evolution of resistant weeds. Now, Ms. Wright, you say in your written testimony, ``There must be a plant pest risk to deny a full deregulation. An herbicide resistance does not constitute a plant pest risk.'' Now I'm questioning your legal interpretation as to whether it's well-founded. Your position is that the sum total of the USDA's authority derives from section of the Plant Protection Act which gives the Secretary authority to prevent the introduction of plant pests. But that is not the sum total. The very next section of the act, section , covers your authority to prevent the spread of, ``Noxious weeds.'' Section ``gives the Secretary authority to prohibit or restrict . . . the movement . . . of any plant . . . if the Secretary determines that the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent . . . the dissemination of a . . . noxious weed within the United States,'' from the statute. Now ``noxious weeds'' are defined by the statute at U.S.C. section as, ``Any plant or plant product that can directly or indirectly injure or cause damage to crops or . . . other interests of agriculture . . . or the environment.'' Ms. Wright, a plain reading of section gives the Secretary the broad authority to restrict the use of Roundup- resistant crops if sound science determines that those restrictions are necessary to prevent the spread of Roundup- resistant noxious weeds. How can you come to Congress and insist that effectively that section doesn't even exist? Ms. Wright. Well, first let me say that this USDA is very committed to looking at all of our programs and policies, and ensuring that they are there for all forms of agriculture---- Mr. Kucinich. I know you're not--this is your first time before a committee. Ms. Wright. It is. Mr. Kucinich. And I do appreciate your being here. I asked you a question, and I would like an answer. That was not responsive. Ms. Wright. We interpret our existing authorities as those focused on plant pest risk. Back in March , we issued a set of updates to our rules and regulations that expanded our authorities into the Noxious Weed Act. We're now looking at , comments on those rule updates. This is a new administration, we will be taking a close look at the full range of comments that came in and be looking very carefully at where our authorities are. Mr. Kucinich. Are you familiar with section of the act? Ms. Wright. No, sir. Mr. Kucinich. You're really not? Before the end of this hearing, I would like staff to have a copy made of section of the act and provide it to the witness, because if the regulatory agency is not fully familiar with the extent of its authority, it may be one of the difficulties we're having here. Ms. Wright. I think the Agency is probably very familiar, but I personally am not, and I'm sorry. Mr. Kucinich. Well, I can understand that it is a new administration, and that you're new, and you do have a very good reputation where you come from. But I think it's important that you become familiarized with the act and with the sections that I articulate, particularly section , which actually does change the role of your agency and your office to effectively regulate herbicide-resistant weeds. If you--I'll take you at your word that you're not familiar with it. But what I glean from that, since you are not familiar with it, you can't point to any provision of the Plant Protection Act that would deny the USDA the ability to use the authority of the section to prevent the spread of Roundup-resistant weeds. I think it's clear from your testimony that the USDA's position is not too much a legal judgment as is a statement of policy. And that it's been the policy of the USDA not to use the authority that it does have under section , it's just very clear. I just want to make this statement to you as the chairman of this oversight subcommittee that a plain reading of section makes it obvious that if the Agency wants to become involved in the enforcement of herbicide-resistant weeds, that it could do it, that you do have the statutory authority to do it, and that it's a policy question. Now you may not be the person who makes the final call on that, but somebody all the way up to--the ladder at Agriculture is making that call, and this subcommittee's determined to see the statute enforced. Now, Ms. Wright I know that the Department understands at this point, that the problem of superweeds is a crisis. What I don't understand, and what defies comprehension is this: That the Department does have the legal ability to help farmers deal with the crisis, and to prevent it from worsening, and that the USDA has not made a policy, a decision to use this authority or has made a policy decision not to use it. Do you have anything further that you can tell this subcommittee? You will read the statute? Ms. Wright. Thank you. Yes, I promise to fully read the statute and I would like to say--and thank you for the opportunity to address this problem and to address the entire issue of coexistence. We're going to have to have a full slate of partners at the table looking at this, including Congress, as well as technical service providers, other Federal agencies, regulated entities and public interest groups. And together, I think, we will be able to solve this problem, including growers, it's not one that--as well as the markets, it's not one that exclusively rests on our shoulders. Mr. Kucinich. Ms. Wright, I want to draw attention to the Department's view that it currently has authority to regulate future planting of GE crops through administrative action. The Department outlined three such actions in a court filing from July of this year. I move to insert into the record the fourth declaration of the APHIS administrator Cindy Smith. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Kucinich. My question, Ms. Wright, is this: Is it also the Department's view that it could, by means of any of those administrative actions, place requirements on a permitted planning of GE herbicide-tolerant crops to prevent the proliferation of herbicide-resistant weeds. Ms. Wright. In both the case of GE alfalfa as well as GE sugar beets there are currently formal petitions before the agency for us to look at ways to partially deregulate these. Mr. Kucinich. So that's a yes? Ms. Wright. We're in the process of looking at that. Mr. Kucinich. So that's a yes? Ms. Wright. So the industry has come to us and asked us to look at that options. Mr. Kucinich. So is this consistent with the testimony that has been given in court? Ms. Wright. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. You found expansive authority to devise three administrative actions allowing to you approve large scale planting under a permit system. What is the basis? Do you have---- Ms. Wright. No, sir. The industry came to us and asked us to look at partial deregulation as one way to allow the planting of a GE crop. Mr. Kucinich. Are you talking about the cases that were struck down by Federal district courts? Ms. Wright. Yes, sir. Mr. Kucinich. That was at the request of the industry, right? Ms. Wright. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. OK. What's the--I'm still trying to figure out the basis for your view here today that a permit system which the GE crop would remain a regulated article and nevertheless not permit to you to place requirement on planting and preventing the spread of Roundup resistance in weeds. Ms. Wright. Unless we determined there a plant pest risk, we do not have it that expansive authority. Mr. Kucinich. So you're still stuck on one section of the act and haven't read the other. Ms. Wright, isn't it true that the Department has had under development, a new biotechnology rule and that the rule was also under development during the previous administration? Ms. Wright. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. OK. And with the change in administration, can this Congress expect to see any differences in the Department's approach to herbicide-resistant weeds and the rule you're now working on. Ms. Wright. I can tell you that we're having internal discussions about our policies, and around coexistence, and that we just honestly cannot afford to look at options and alternatives that are not supportive of various cropping systems, including biotechnology, organic and conventional. They all play a very critical role in the health of our rural economy and in our agricultural economy. Mr. Kucinich. I know that was in your opening statement. I heard that. But it's not responsive to the question I asked. Ms. Wright. Can you ask your question again? Will you please restate your question? Mr. Kucinich. There has been a change in administrations, can we expect to see any difference in the Department's approach to herbicide-resistant weeds in the rule that you're now working on? Ms. Wright. I think we're looking at all--a lot of options, and we're going back and looking, considering the comments that were submitted. We're internally having discussions across the Department. We have a Secretary and an administration that's very committed to the idea of addressing the issues of coexistence, and that's as much as I can say today. Mr. Kucinich. See the thing that I'm concerned about--and I am really trying to give you the benefit of the doubt on what you're saying, the thing that I'm concerned about, is that when you go back to your talking points, you actually inadvertently shut the door on consideration of the science and experience that's been brought forward through the EPA's enforcement through the practical experience of farmers, through the NRC report. And so I'm trying to--because it's important that we understand--you've made it clear that the policy, you know, what the policy is, you haven't extended that to a legal interpretation, but if you're just saying well, you know, we have different ways of supporting agriculture, we're going to try to support them all. But if you rest on that and don't go deeply into expressing to this subcommittee a concern that the extent to which herbicide-resistant weeds may represent an attack on the rights of farmers, the economic rights of farmers, the environment, if you don't articulate that, it causes me to pause. Ms. Wright. Well--out of all due respect, I would say that it's not that we don't recognize this as a bottom line issue for farmers and ranchers---- Mr. Kucinich. It's what? Ms. Wright. It's not that we don't recognize this as a critical issue for farmers and ranchers, but I think this administration and USDA see biotechnology as being a very important tool for farmers to use in addressing some very critical issues, globally and here domestically. And all of the options that we look at have to be supportive of that, they have to encourage and support innovation in a smart way. Mr. Kucinich. Do they look the other way if there is a problem? Ms. Wright. No, I don't think so. We take our NEPA process and documents very seriously. In fact, the Secretary just approved a reorganization of our BRS services, we have a whole team, a new team, a whole program dedicated to NEPA now. We have a budget increase request before Congress for , fiscal year of $ . million to hire new scientists. We take these issues very seriously. And as we learn more about the environmental impacts of this technology, we try to adjust and we try to make our rules and regulations. Mr. Kucinich. Just out of curiosity, you think--genetic-- you just talked about the importance of biotechnology, is it your view, personally, that genetically engineered crops are the functional equivalent of conventional crops? Ms. Wright. Well, I'm not prepared to reflect on that. Mr. Kucinich. OK, that's fine. For the last couple of decades, the EPA and the USDA had pledged in various Memoranda of Understanding to promote integrated pest management. One of the key objectives of integrated pest management is preserving the efficacy of relatively benign pesticides and preventing herbicide resistance in weeds. Now I move to insert into the record one such Memorandum of Understanding from . Now, to the EPA, I want to address this question, does it concern the EPA from the perspective of integrated pest management that more and more acres of farmland are showing signs of infestation by Roundup-resistant weeds? Mr. Jones. Yes, it does. Mr. Kucinich. Now, in general, isn't proliferation of Roundup-resistant weeds across millions of acres of farmland a setback for integrated pest management? Mr. Jones. Sure. Mr. Kucinich. And to the USDA, does the USDA agree with the EPA that from the perspective of integrated pest management to widespread infestation of Roundup-resistant weeds constitutes a setback? Ms. Wright. I'm sorry, can you please repeat that? Mr. Kucinich. Does the USDA agree with the EPA, which just responded yes, that the proliferation of Roundup-resistant weeds across millions of acres of farmland is a setback for integrated pest management. I asked you, do you agree with the EPA from the perspective of integrated pest management, the widespread infestation of Roundup resistance weeds constitutes a setback? Ms. Wright. Possibly, yes. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Jones, in communication with the majority staff, the EPA has stated that the USDA did solicit EPA's input in its Environmental Impact Statement for Roundup Ready Alfalfa, but as we've already seen, the Environmental Impact Statement will not consider any measures for preventing the spread of Roundup-resistant weeds. USDA testified that EPA raised no objection to their draft environmental impact strategy on alfalfa, which USDA characterizes as meaning, ``The EPA had no concerns.'' Is that a complete representation of EPA's comments to USDA on the Roundup-Ready Alfalfa Environmental Impact Statement? Mr. Jones. Chairman, to be fair to my colleagues at USDA-- -- Mr. Kucinich. I'm asking you to answer the question, not to be fair, but to answer the question. Mr. Jones. The answer to the question is that an Agency's formal response that went through our office of Federal activities, we did not raise the issue of insects--I'm sorry, herbicide resistance. In informal conversations, when we've had a number of them, and they continue to this day. Mr. Kucinich. So you did raise a concern about weed resistance management; is that right? Mr. Jones. That's correct. Mr. Kucinich. Now Ms. Wright, this is somewhat at a variance with your written testimony. And contrary to that, does the USDA now acknowledge that the EPA did, in fact, express concern about the weed resistance management issue in the alfalfa Environmental Impact Statement? Ms. Wright. Yes, we did. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Jones, did USDA ever ask EPA to offer its expertise in preventing pest resistance in the context of the USDA's preparation of an environmental impact statement for deregulating GE alfalfa? Mr. Jones. Once we raise the concerns that we have identified through informal mechanisms that led to an ongoing dialog between USDA and EPA to address those, and so---- Mr. Kucinich. Did they ask you to offer your expertise? Mr. Jones. That is correct. Mr. Kucinich. What did they ask you to do? Mr. Jones. When we raised our--we raised some issues associated with resistance management, and as it was characterized in EIS. And the Department said to us, you've raised some very good points, let's talk about that, we want to understand this better. And those conversations continue, as I said, to this day, and I believe will continue until we feel like we're on the same page on that issue. Mr. Kucinich. Well, given the scientific verification of the rapid spread of Roundup-resistant weeds, do you think it might be justifiable for the EPA and the USDA to revisit the question in preparation for the final environmental impact statement for Roundup Ready Alfalfa, Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones. I believe that's what we're doing right now. Mr. Kucinich. And to Ms. Wright, given the EPA's successful effort thus far in preventing the Bacillus thuringiensis resistance in pests, wouldn't it make sense for the USDA to want to utilize the EPA's expertise to help regulatory means to prevent and mitigate Roundup resistance in weeds? Ms. Wright. Yes. And if it's OK with you, I'd like to ask Sid Abel to address more of the specifics around how we are working with EPA. Mr. Kucinich. He's sworn, he can do that. Mr. Abel. We are--right now we're working very directly at the staff level with our partners at the EPA to address specifically the issue of glyphosate tolerance among weeds. We agree, both with EPA and with other parts of our Federal partners, that this is a serious issue for farmers. It's also a serious issue for the technology. We see that this is a very favorable compound to be used in controlling weeds, and to preserve that technology is very important to us. So we've entered into these discussions with EPA at the staff level with the Weed Science Society of America, and with others, universities and extension agents to get a better handle on the extent to which glyphosate tolerance is occurring out there, not just in GE crops, but also in conventional crops. We believe that by going through this process, we'll be able to put forward some strategies for managing these crops in a way to preserve these technologies into the future. Mr. Kucinich. Have you read section of the act? Mr. Abel. It has been a while, but yes, sir, I have. Mr. Kucinich. Would you read it again? Mr. Abel. Yes, I would. Mr. Kucinich. I want to thank the members of this panel for participating in this important discussion. And this committee will continue to retain jurisdiction over this matter, which means that there will be more hearings. We are very interested in the policies of the USDA as it affects the environment, farmers. And I'm grateful for your presence here today and for the EPA's continuing work in this area as well. The first panel is dismissed and I'm going to call the second panel to come forward, and we will begin the second panel in a couple of minutes as soon as you're all in place. I am going to read the introductions at this moment while staff is getting set up. I want to welcome to this subcommittee Congresswoman Diane Watson, Ambassador Watson from California, for gracing this hearing. We have here today Mr. Steve Smith. Mr. Smith, welcome. Mr. Smith is director of agriculture at Red Gold, Inc., the largest privately-held canned tomato processor in the country.

STATEMENTS OF STEVE SMITH, DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, RED GOLD TOMATO; PHIL MILLER, VICE PRESIDENT, GLOBAL REGULATORY, MONSANTO CO.; BILL FREESE, SCIENCE ADVISOR, CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY; AND JAY VROOM, CEO, CROPLIFE AMERICA STATEMENT OF STEVE SMITH Mr. Smith. Thank you, Chairman Kucinich, and members of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee. I thank you for the opportunity to present to you some important concerns about the pending release of dicamba-resistant soybeans. My name is Steve Smith, director of agriculture for Red Gold, the largest privately-held canned tomato processor in the United States. Red Gold is based in Indiana and has three processing facilities. Our tomatoes are grown by family farming operations in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. Our concerns about the upcoming increased use of dicamba are not just about tomatoes but all fruit and vegetable crops and rural homeowners living near local farms. The use of dicamba is not new. It is effective, it is a great weed killer, and it is economical to apply. So many may be wondering why a product that is effective, proven, and economical is not the No. herbicide in use today. The answer is simple: dicamba has also proven itself to move off target and injure adjoining crops, so it is not currently widely used. New technology is good and needs to be pursued, but must be examined for unintended consequences. At one time the conventional wisdom thought it was a good idea to use lead in paint. The theory of dicamba-tolerant soybeans might appear sound on the surface--the ability to kill weeds is proven--but the potential damage to other sectors of agriculture and rural homeowners demands that we take a closer look at this particular advance. When put in the spotlight, the answer will become abundantly clear: The widespread use of dicamba is incompatible with Midwestern agriculture. dicamba is highly vulnerable to offsite movement in three forms: direct drift, volatilization, and spray-tank contamination. You would think that the risk of direct drift could be completely controlled by good management practices such as spraying in little or no wind or when the wind was blowing away from sensitive crops such as tomatoes. But unfortunately, that is not always the case. Red Gold has suffered over $ million in drift claims over the last years. A reduced application window has forced otherwise good farmers to spray on windy days when they know they shouldn't. But I want to focus on volatilization because it is the real issue that makes dicamba a danger to Midwestern agriculture. Volatilization occurs when the active ingredient evaporates and then can be moved with the surrounding air mass for up to days after application; and its killing capabilities can spread up to miles or more in certain geographic areas such as in a valley. Even the best farmer, the most conscientious farmers can't control or predict what will happen for up to days after application. Ironically, the very conditions that minimize direct drift actually maximize volatilization: little or no wind, high temperatures, and high humidity--normal conditions for when this product is applied in June and July. A good neighbor that awakens early in the morning to spray before the winds pick up would be at the highest risk of causing volatilization injury. In other testimony offered, we learn that new formulations of dicamba will reduce the risk of volatilization. We believe those claims to be overly optimistic as even the newest formulations are still proven to move off target. It simply is impossible to control or predict its movement. The science is clear and settled in regard to dicamba's susceptibility to off- target movement due to volatilility. If, as you might hear from others, the risks of off-target movement of dicamba due to volatilization are low and can be controlled through improved product stewardship and formulations, it only makes sense that those who will profit from the sale of this seed technology and the makers of dicamba should willingly step up to the plate and establish an indemnity fund to cover crop losses and homeowners' claims for damages. If they are unwilling to cover potential losses, is this an admission that the safety of this technology is not as safe as we have been led to believe? The Midwest is the home to a unique system of family farms that are known as the bread basket of the world. The introduction of dicamba-tolerant soybeans is a classic case of shortsighted enthusiasm over a new technology, putting this region at unneeded risk, and blinding us to the reality of damage that is sure to come. Even the best, the most conscientious farmers cannot control where this weed killer will end up. Increased dicamba usage made possible through the introduction of dicamba- tolerant soybeans is poor public policy and should not be allowed. Thank you for the opportunity to present my concerns to you today. I will be happy to answer any questions you might have concerning this topic. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you, Mr. Smith.

Chairman Kucinich and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify on matters relating to modern agricultural technology. I work at Monsanto whose only focus is agriculture. I spent much of my youth in a small agricultural community in Lawrence County, Illinois, where I had the privilege of helping my grandfather on his farm. I also have a farm in Nebraska. Through my experiences, I have a great appreciation for what the American farmer has and can achieve with the right tools and a willingness to adopt new technologies and practices. I currently serve as vice president of regulatory, with more than scientists in my organization, and it is responsible for the global product approval and stewardship. The topic of today's hearing is an important one. The world population is growing. In the next years or so, there will be billion people on our planet. That is billion more people that will show up to the dinner table, and many will want to use the foods we have grown up with. To put it in context, that is the equivalent of three more Chinas. The challenge is: How do we do it using fewer resources? Farmers are increasingly being asked to produce more with less, and helping to do this is what Monsanto is all about. Our company has a commitment to sustainable agriculture. We will do our part to help farmers double yield in the core crops of corn, cotton, and soybeans between and , while producing each bushel or bale with one-third fewer resources. Just as important, in doing so we will help farmers earn more, and improve the lives of their families and rural communities globally. Agricultural innovation has provided farmers with improved agronomic practices, advances in breeding, and novel traits through modern biotechnology, which increases yield and profits. In , the Roundup Ready system was first introduced into soybeans. The Roundup Ready system was attractive to farmers because it offered superior crop safety and the use of a familiar and proven herbicide that controls more than weeds. In Roundup Ready Soybeans, glyphosate sprayed after the crop's weeds emerge provide a level of weed control and ease of use that surpasses other options. Importantly, in addition to the benefits provided in weed control, the Roundup Ready system has made the adoption of conservation tillage practices feasible. Conservation tillage contributes to the long-term sustainability of farming practices. Before the Roundup Ready system was introduced, the environmental benefits of conservation tillage were documented, but adoption by growers had been limited. The broad enrollment in conservation tillage due to the Roundup Ready system has led to the reduction and extensive plowing and tillage which has significantly reduced the loss of topsoil due to erosion, improved soil structure, reduced runoff of sediment and fertilizer, reduced on-farm fuel use, reduced CO emissions, and increased carbon sequestration in the soil. Controlling weeds is paramount in maintaining and improving crop productivity. Unlike insects and diseases which occur in some years and not others, weeds occur in crops every year. Experts recommend using multiple herbicides to provide more than one mechanism of action. Applying multiple mechanisms of action reduces the likelihood of a resistant weed population developing because there is a low probability that a particular weed within a population would have resistance to both mechanisms of action. In addition, farmers may choose to use mechanical or cultural techniques in addition to or in place of herbicides. The specific program employed would depend on the farmer's choice and the best management practices on his or her farm. Monsanto has shared interest with farmers in effective weed management. The proactive adoption of best management practices based on the principle of diversity in weed management will improve weed control, help ensure that conservation tillage systems are sustainable, and that the yield, economic, and environmental benefits are fully realized. As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, Monsanto's only focus is agriculture. If farmers don't succeed, Monsanto doesn't succeed. That is why as we bring new technology to the market, we value growers' input, such as Mr. Smith who is here today, who we have invited and has become a member of our dicamba advisory council. We are committed to invest and develop seed and trait systems to provide farmers with effective, affordable, convenient and sustainable agricultural solutions, including weed control. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your time and attention today. I look forward to answering your questions. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you for your testimony. [The prepared statement of Mr. Miller follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Freese. STATEMENT OF BILL FREESE Mr. Freese. Yes. Chairman Kucinich and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today to testify. I would just like to preference my remarks quickly to respond to something Ms. Wright and Mr. Miller just said about world hunger and productivity. Actually, the subject here, Roundup Ready crops, do not have higher yields. That is a myth. It is basically designed to save time and save labor and help farmers get bigger. Also, there is an increase in pesticide use with these crops, actually quite substantial, not a decrease. And the conservation tillage benefits that Mr. Miller mentioned, conservation tillage was mostly adopted before the introduction of these Roundup Ready crops. Just as Roundup Ready crops were being introduced in , Monsanto scientists published a paper in which they presented all of the reasons weeds were not likely to evolve resistance to glyphosate. It is not the first time they have been wrong, and they turned out to be disastrously wrong. As discussed in part of this hearing in July, unregulated use of these crop systems has triggered an epidemic of glyphosate-resistant weeds, and it fostered sharp increases in herbicide use, greater use of soil-eroding tillage operations, and is substantially raising weed control costs for ever-more growers. Now Monsanto and other pesticide firms assure us that multiple herbicide-resistant weeds are the solution to glyphosate-resistant weeds. Dupont, for instance, even envisions a single crop resistant to seven or more different classes of herbicides. There are hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in resistance genes to just about every herbicide imaginable, including paraquat, for instance, and about half of the GE crops pending deregulation at USDA right now are herbicide- resistant. We shouldn't let ourselves be misled again. These new herbicide-resistant crops are the wrong response to glyphosate- resistant weeds. Just very briefly, and I can go into detail in questions if you would like, but one reason is that they simply won't work. At best we will get a short-term reprieve until nature cleverly evolves resistance to the new and multiple herbicides deployed against them. Second, farmers will pay in multiple ways through increasingly expensive biotech seeds and the multiple herbicide cocktails that come with them, and through crop damage, as Steve mentioned, or through purchasing the HR seed in order to defend oneself against drift. Third, both public health and the environment will suffer from a substantially increased use of toxic herbicides such as , -D and dicamba. Finally, this new wave of crops diverts attention from truly sustainable weed control practices, which I would like to get to in a moment. I think it is very clear that the glyphosate-resistant weed epidemic is a symptom of regulatory breakdown. We have USDA which regulates an herbicide-resistant crop, and the EPA the herbicide; but no one regulates the combination, the herbicide- resistant crop, the herbicide system. And it is the system, the continual use of a herbicide, glyphosate on Roundup Ready crops, that is responsible for the growing epidemic of resistant weeds. This system has been presented to farmers as self-contained, two component, seed and Roundup, and that is the way it has been used. I am tired of people blaming farmers for this. When a Federal district court judge reversed APHIS's deregulation of Roundup Ready alfalfa, he underscored APHIS's failure to examine glyphosate use. APHIS now gives purely pro forma attention to herbicide use in their regulatory reviews, and even this minimal treatment is grossly inadequate. APHIS, for instance, dismissed analysis of herbicide use of Roundup Ready crops in the Roundup Ready draft and Environmental Impact Statement that relied on gold-standard data from its sister agency, the National Agricultural Statistic Service, and in its place it used bogus data from simulations conducted by pesticide industry-funded groups, like the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy and PG Economics. In other cases, USDA cited completely irrelevant data that was years old or more, no relevance. APHIS also ignored research by scientists from USDA's Agricultural Research Service and others that point to potentially increased disease susceptibility in Roundup-treated, Roundup Ready crops. And, unfortunately, USDA does not require testing of Roundup Ready crops to which Roundup has been applied, which is the invariable practice of farmers. In view of the growing evidence of disease, possible disease susceptibility issues, that is inexcusable. I would just like to say USDA should definitely follow the lead of the EPA. The successful insect resistant management program could be followed by USDA. And I don't buy Ms. Wright's protestations that USDA doesn't have authority. The noxious weed provisions of the Plant Protection Action clearly gives them authority to regulate practices that foster noxious weeds, and that is exactly what these Roundup Ready systems are. Mr. Kucinich. I thank the gentleman for his testimony. As I said, your entire testimony will be included in the record of this hearing. I am sure that we will get back to you with some questions. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Freese follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

STATEMENT OF JAY VROOM Mr. Vroom. Thank you, Chairman Kucinich and Congresswoman Watson, for allowing me to come and provide testimony today on behalf of the crop protection industry and CropLife America. Thank you for introducing me earlier. In addition to my role as CEO of our trade association, I also have an Illinois farm background and happen to still own the family farm that I was reared on. I happen to have been in Illinois twice in the last weeks. Six weeks ago I stopped to take a look at one of the fields that is now being operated by my cousin. It was planted this year in Roundup Ready Soybeans. It was planted as a no- till crop, and Mr. Chairman, I would love to share this photograph. There are three of them here. I am most proud of this particular view, because it shows this field in the direction in which a terrace that my father installed as a charter member of our Bureau County, IL, soil and water conservation district, one of the first terraces installed in the country, to provide then the cutting-edge technology for soil conservation at that time. I remember as a youth hand-weeding and hand-cultivating with mechanical means fields of soybeans and other crops on this very field, and we were not able to control the soil erosion as we can today with the Roundup Ready technology. If I can pass this up and maybe ask your staff to share that with you. Mr. Kucinich. We will include it in the record. Without objection, so ordered. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Vroom. Thank you. So conservation tillage is an important component of the introduction of biotechnology. I also have a report by our Crop Protection Research Institute that illustrates on a graph of introduction of modern biotechnology and then the takeoff of the adoption of conservation tillage in this country. It has made a meaningful difference, and I believe there are clear USDA statistics to that effect. Mr. Kucinich. Without objection, that will be included in the record of the hearing. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Vroom. Thank you. My experience, and I just talked to my cousin who was combining soybeans this morning, he assured me that he was aware of weed resistance and he has taken steps to manage it on this particular field, and we know that we don't have the most severe weed-resistance problems with regard to glyphosate situations, as are apparent in some of those million acres that you refer to. Our industry, along with USDA--and unfortunately Ms. Wright probably didn't have adequate time or background to explain to you the full resources the USDA brings to bear with regard to helping farmers manage weed resistance in both biotechnology crops and elsewhere. Extension, our industry scientists, crop consultants that are private individuals, crop input retailers, all have a stake in all of this and we have a marvelous system to help farmers manage these issues. But we do appreciate the fact that you have an interest in examining the regulatory authority of the agencies that are charged with overseeing these technologies, and we look forward to working with you as you give consideration to ways to have oversight and consideration of these matters. Last, I would just tell you that our industry has formed a herbicide resistance action committee. It is a global entity that CropLife and our partner associations around the world are involved with, and it provides a mechanism for the common research that herbicide companies engage in with regard to helping to stay ahead of the curve and ensure that we can manage herbicide resistance in both biotechnology-enhanced crops and conventional crops as well. So we believe that we do have a system in place that allows us to continue to manage these issues. We understand the particular media attention that has been given to herbicide resistance in biotechnology crops, but we believe that we have an adequate system, and we appreciate the attention that you will continue to provide to this issue. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much, Mr. Vroom. [The prepared statement of Mr. Vroom follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Kucinich. I just want to assure you that we provided Ms. Wright with as much time as she needs to be able to answer this committee's questions, and we will continue to do that. Let's go to questions of this second panel. Mr. Miller, with Monsanto's percent focus, as you have said, on agriculture, I am wondering who is responsible for the proliferation of weeds and weed species that have become Roundup-resistant since the introduction of Roundup Ready crop systems? Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I mentioned earlier, if our farmers are not successful, we are not successful, and we take this matter very seriously. I would say herbicide-tolerant weeds is not a new thing. It is something we have had to manage in the industry as well as with university weed scientists and farmers in how they run their operations on their farm. So we invest a lot in the science of weed resistance and understanding that and providing technical solutions to growers along with others. That is really our focus. Mr. Kucinich. I don't know if you have testified before a congressional committee, and all committees are different. Mr. Miller. No, sir. Mr. Kucinich. I am the kind of chairman that when I ask a question, I would like to get a direct answer. Would you tell me who is responsible for the proliferation of weeds and weed species that have become Roundup-resistant since the introduction of Roundup Ready crop systems? Mr. Miller. I think weeds that are resistant to glyphosate are the responsibility of industry, government, weed sciences, as well as farmers, to properly steward the product. Mr. Kucinich. So industry--you are part of the industry with Monsanto. The USDA is part of that system. There is a responsibility there. There is a whole feedback loop here, you are saying; right? Mr. Miller. I think there is a feedback loop, but this is a herbicide issue, and I believe herbicides are regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Kucinich. It is encouraging that you have stated that industry has a responsibility here. But you also stated that government has a responsibility as a regulatory authority, did you not? Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, I believe that our regulatory agencies have clear responsibilities to demonstrate and prove the safety in use of these products. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you. Let me direct your attention to this ad circulated before . This is Monsanto, Mr. Miller, in this ad, telling farmers to use more and more Roundup and to use it exclusively to control weeds. That was just years ago. And it was also years after Roundup-resistant horseweed was discovered in Roundup Ready crop yields in Delaware. Mr. Miller, help us out here. Isn't it true if farmers followed Monsanto's advice conveyed in this ad, that they would have Roundup-resistant weeds in their fields today? Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, weed resistance is caused by many factors. Prior to , and many systems that we developed and co-developed with the university weed science academics and the Weed Science Society of America--and, by the way, I believe one of those academics was actually referenced in that ad just reflecting on a picture I saw--the recommendation was that glyphosate had a low probability of developing resistance, and our recommendation was to utilize that in the system. But in cases where we have begun to discover there are resistant weeds, we have done a lot of training, education with growers, retailers, and other in the industry to recommend multiple modes of actions into our cropping systems. Mr. Kucinich. I am going to ask staff to copy this and give you a copy. Have you read this? Just look at it. I'm not trying to trap you here, because I believe in having a conversation. It says no benefit in rotating glyphosate. No benefit. Can you explain that to me in light of what you said a moment ago? Take your time. When you are ready to answer, go ahead. If you want to rephrase anything for the record, you can do that, too. Mr. Miller. Actually, I would like to read the recommendation as stated by Monsanto in this particular article. In many Midwest cropping systems, agronomic conditions and cultural practice are conducive to preemergent application, an herbicide that is not glyphosate, so one mode of action, followed by Roundup agriculture herbicides, or a tank mix of residual, two different modes of action, agricultural herbicide before weeds exceed inches. So this particular ad does actually steward two growers, and I am responding to the title, ``No Benefit from Rotating Glyphosate,'' was the fact that you use multiple modes of action in your system, and if you use a Roundup Ready crop in the same field the next year, and you steward it properly by using multiple modes of action, there is no need to change your overall cropping system. Mr. Kucinich. This is your ad. It says, no benefit in rotating glyphosate, as you just read. Now, I showed the same ad and asked the same question to a prominent weed scientist who testified at our previous hearing. I am sure that somebody in your organization read that testimony. He was the author of the weed chapter of the National Research Council's report published in April. Do you want to guess what his response was to the question of whether farmers would have Roundup-resistant weeds in their fields today if they followed the advice that was conveyed in Monsanto's ads? What do you think his answer was? Mr. Miller. Chairman Kucinich, I wouldn't want to speculate on that. Mr. Kucinich. OK. That is fine. It is recommended reading for you. His answer was ``yes.'' Mr. Miller, why was the discovery of Roundup-resistant horseweed as early as the year not sufficient evidence of Roundup resistance in weeds to move Monsanto to change its advice to farmers? Mr. Miller. Congressman, first of all, I will go back to if our growers are not successful, we are not successful. So as we actually had the evidence of the first resistant weeds, we actually enabled university research, our own research, to understand the mechanism of that resistance. The second thing that we did was enlisted those regional university extension agents to help us develop what the recommendation for the grower was in order to keep their farming operations successful. Once we had that identified, we actually went out and did significant training with producers, often recommending our competitor's product as part of the solution to ensure that the farmer has a weed-free field. Mr. Kucinich. Let me just share something with you. About hours ago, I was in a full committee hearing with Johnson & Johnson looking at how they let two different products enter the market, one of which had potential serious health consequences for consumers. And one of these drugs, they sent in phantom purchasers to get the drug back. There was active concealment going on. The thing that strikes me that you said about if your customers are not successful, you are not successful. You said that earlier in your testimony. I actually wrote it down here. If farmers don't succeed, Monsanto does not succeed. It is eerily similar almost to the words except changing ``Johnson & Johnson'' to ``Monsanto'' to the testimony of the CEO of Johnson & Johnson. That is the reason I am calling it to your attention. I don't question your background. You have a tremendous background and you are certainly qualified to testify before this subcommittee. There is no question about that. You represent Monsanto well. The question I have is the aspirational expressions that you make on behalf of Monsanto do not square with the experiential elements of the use of this crop. That is kind of where we are going with this. I am not condemning you; I just want to say that there is some difficulty in squaring this. Now, Mr. Freese, is it true that Roundup-resistant weeds was a development that took everyone, including Monsanto, by surprise? Or was it a foreseen danger? Mr. Freese. I think it was mixed. I know there were some weed scientists who thought there wouldn't be resistance evolving, but others predicted it. Mr. Kucinich. Some were surprised? Mr. Freese. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. What about you? Mr. Freese. I wasn't following the issue at the time. Mr. Kucinich. But you have a report; isn't that right? Mr. Freese. A report, yes, by some colleagues in the public interest community called ``Biotechnologies: Bitter Harvest.'' It is a very searching and comprehensive report on what at that time was still an experimental technology. , this was years before the introduction of the first Roundup Ready crop--in this report the scientists clearly see huge potential for development of herbicide-resistant weeds, and particularly with this technology. There was a report by Consumers Union, another consumer group. Mr. Kucinich. So you are saying that scientists did see the potential for herbicide-resistant weeds. Which scientists are you talking about? Mr. Freese. This report was written by Dr. Rebecca Goldberg with Environmental Defense Fund; and Jane Rissler, who is now with Union of Concerned Scientists; and Hope Shand and Chuck Hassebrook. Mr. Kucinich. What year was that? Mr. Freese. . Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Miller, you have been with Monsanto since , right? Mr. Miller. That is correct. Mr. Kucinich. I actually took notes during your testimony, and you said in your testimony that Monsanto has scientists who work for the company. Did you say that? Mr. Miller. Actually, sir, my statement was that in my regulatory group there are scientists. There are over a couple of thousand scientists in our company. Mr. Kucinich. That is even more impressive. A couple thousand scientists. Do you have any knowledge within the sphere of your activities in the regulatory group of any reports that were brought to you expressing concerns about herbicide-resistant crops? Mr. Miller. I was not in that responsibility at that time. But I can say---- Mr. Kucinich. When did you come into that responsibility? Mr. Miller. Just in the last months, sir. But I have been in the company years as a researcher. I can share with you that I think it is even documented in literature that with the Roundup or glyphosate tolerance, we stated there was a possibility. We said it was a low probability. And I would say anytime we develop any of our products, as I mentioned earlier, including with Mr. Smith here, before we develop them, we actually create forums to understand the data that is out there and the concerns that exist, and take that into consideration as we develop our safe products. Mr. Kucinich. What I would like to do, and I want to direct the subcommittee staff here to work with Mr. Miller in gaining access to the studies that were done by the scientists at Monsanto with respect to herbicide-resistant weeds, because what we can do here is to be able to identify the progress that has been made through this scientific research with the scientists who are working for you and perhaps thousands of scientists who are working with Monsanto. So we will produce from this hearing a followup request for documents so that we can enable a better understanding of Monsanto's awareness of this. I would appreciate your cooperation. Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to work with you on that request. Ms. Watson. Mr. Chairman, can you yield just minutes to me? I have another subcommittee hearing. Mr. Kucinich. I am pleased to yield to the gentlelady at this moment. I was going to yield minutes to you. If you need minutes, you can have it now. Ms. Watson. Thank you. I won't use all of that time. I am very interested in this subject matter, because just recently they announced that there is a new salmon that is going to be on the market that has been, shall I say, biologically bred to grow larger, and you might recall some of the advertisements in the last few days. We are questioning whether that will have an impact on humans once they consume that salmon. And so I was listening very closely to see if Monsanto or other companies like you test the environmental impact of these new--what you are working with is an herbicide--but do you test first to see what the impact will be on the environment. Or does it grow? The chair is asking for you to kind of document what was done prior to putting it on the market, and I am wondering how far do you go putting these products out there before you test their effect on the environment? Mr. Miller. Would you like me to answer that? Ms. Watson. Yes. Mr. Miller. OK. You know, I am very proud of the process that we use both to validate the value that we bring to growers, as well as the safety of our products. As you know, the products that we have put out on the market , if it is a chemistry, it is EPA. Biotech, it could be EPA, USDA, FDA. All of those go through thorough health and safety assessments both internally in our organization as well as with those agencies. Often we have other third parties that look into that, because at the end of the day, we want to ensure the health and safety, and we believe that system has worked extremely well. Ms. Watson. What do you feel you have to do now in light of this, the findings that this superweed is so strong that it doesn't react to whatever you have out there to try to kill it? It is going to have an impact, and it is going to have a financial impact certainly on the farmers and all. And so what do you see that needs to be done? We are the subcommittee of oversight. What is it that we can do within this process to guarantee that people won't be harmed, crops won't be harmed? What needs to be done? What are we missing? Mr. Miller. Chairman Watson, I am not sure I can address the question of what we are missing, but I can address what we are doing. I think this is being taken very seriously by Monsanto, as well as other technology providers in the industry. I think it is being taken extremely seriously by weed scientists. And as was mentioned by Jay earlier, our growers take this very seriously, even before they have weed-resistance issues. What we are doing about it, we have invested well over $ million in just the last years. Mr. Kucinich. If the gentleman would suspend. Ms. Wright, I just want to put it on the record that Ms. Wright did stay for most of the testimony because that doesn't always happen, and I want to thank you for your presence here and for listening to the witnesses' testimony and questions. Thank you very much. I just wanted to put that on the record. If you are ready to continue, you may. Thank you. Mr. Miller. Yes. So we are putting significant research, as well as working with those local academics to help come up with best recommendation for farmers. Two things that I want to bring out. There are glyphosate- resistant weeds, but there are still greater than weeds that do not have resistance, so this is still a hugely available tool to growers, and they acknowledge that every time I go out and visit with them. I am not going to diminish the fact that if one of the weeds is resistant to glyphosate, that there needs to be a control option provided for that grower, and we actually have spent a lot of time, even with the ad that was shown earlier, working on that particular species of weed. There are control options available on the market, and we are helping growers be trained on how to use that in their agricultural systems. Ms. Watson. I am really concerned about the consumer side of all of these new products that are out there, and so we are going back and the chair is asking that we have some documentation so that we can guarantee that we who have the oversight have done all we can to ensure that these products will not have a negative effect on whatever it is, and on consumers. So we are just probing right now to see what our responsibilities are. And if you are looking at evaluating the environmental impacts of your product, I want to say thank you so much. That is what I would like to know. And I am sure that the chair has also asked for that information. With that, I will wait to see it. As we probe in this area, Mr. Chairman, I want to be a partner with you. I am really concerned about that new--does anybody remember seeing the information on television? If so, put your hand up. I want to know about this salmon that is going to be three or four times the size of any normally grown salmon. If we are to consume it, what is the impact going to be on our digestive systems with this larger salmon? So in all good faith, we are just asking you to let us know what we need to look at so we can protect the consumers. Thank you very much. Mr. Kucinich. I thank the gentlewoman for her questions. The subcommittee is also looking at the issues with respect to genetically engineered salmon. I want to say, when the gentlelady asked the question, What are we missing, she was actually inviting Mr. Miller to help us in our probe here. But I would say this; that we look forward to cooperating with you, that cooperation through information that brings us to a level of comfort that the public interest is being protected. And in pursuit of the public interest, we try not to miss too much. Mr. Miller, you have heard testimony today about concerns that your dicamba/Roundup-tolerant soybean will cause collateral injury to fruit and vegetable farmers, and I would add, even backyard gardeners. That is essentially what Mr. Smith was testifying to. Your testimony, in fact, acknowledges concerns. Now, in the event that an injury should materialize, apropos of a question Mr. Smith raised, who would be liable for the economic costs to the affected farmers? Would it be Monsanto or another party? Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, you know, I am not an attorney. Mr. Kucinich. I am not either. I just play one on TV. Mr. Miller. I don't believe I can answer that. We would be happy to followup with you later at the appropriate time when we have that information. Mr. Kucinich. I will accept you are not an attorney and you don't want to answer a question that gets you, excuse the expression, into the weeds about the legal implications of this policy. But I would say that we would seek to entertain that discussion with Monsanto attorneys, because this is one of the questions that is being raised here. You have a product, if it has some adverse effect on certain people, there are some questions of liability. I am not asking you to accept liability here. I know what your limitations are as a witness at this moment. You made that clear. But let me ask you this: Do you think it is correct to classify the injury fruit and vegetable farmers fear from the use of the dicamba soybean system as an indirect cost of the development of Roundup resistance in weeds? Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, I am not sure that I follow your question. I would appreciate if you could restate it. Mr. Kucinich. Well, you have Roundup resistance in weeds that is showing up. Farmers are concerned, and some farmers have expressed that there has been an injury to their fruits and vegetables. You have sold this dicamba soybean system. If the farmers are experiencing this loss, isn't that loss essentially an off-loading of expense, an indirect cost of the development of Roundup resistance in weeds? Mr. Miller. You know, we are years away from introducing dicamba/Roundup Ready soybeans into the market. So as we bring these forward--and it takes us well over a decade from the time we begin to develop these products until we launch it-- years before the launch, we actually set up a dicamba grower or dicamba advisory council, including many of the producers in the fruit, vineyard, and tomato industry. And by the way, as Monsanto, we are one of the largest vegetable seed producers in the world. Tomato customers in that business are some of our biggest customers. And as I mentioned earlier, we care about our customers' success. Our focus is to continue to bring weed-free cropping systems to our producers in corn, soybean, and cotton, as well as serve the interest of those fruit and vegetable producers. We have a significant amount of research going on, with their input, to ensure when that product comes on the market it is successfully implemented. Mr. Kucinich. Do you have legal counsel here with you? Mr. Miller. Yes, I do. Mr. Kucinich. Would counsel identify himself, please? Mr. Sopko. John Sopko of Akin Gump. Mr. Kucinich. OK. Actually, I know you gave an answer. You didn't answer the question; but if I pressed you to answer the question, I know counsel would advise you not to, so I will move on. Mr. Freese, can you answer the question I asked about do you think it is correct to classify the injury fruit and vegetable farmers fear from the use of the dicamba soybean system as an indirect cost of the development of Roundup resistance in weeds? Mr. Freese. I think that is very good way to describe it. The way that the Roundup Ready crop system is used and is meant to be used, I would say it has led to some pretty massive weed resistance. Unfortunately, the way we approach weeds in this country is so completely focused, so completely focused on using pesticides, that a new herbicide-resistant crop, resistance to different herbicides, seems to be the only thing that a lot of our companies and even the USDA takes seriously. In fact, there are many very viable, nonchemical ways to control weeds. Mr. Kucinich. I am going to go back to Mr. Smith here, because you are in touch with a base of people about these products. You have testified, and I am quoting from your testimony, ``The widespread use of dicamba is incompatible with Midwestern agriculture.'' Mr. Smith. Yes, sir. Mr. Kucinich. I am from Ohio. I hear that. How significant is the risk of injury to fruit and vegetable farmers and processors from planting the dicamba soybean in Indiana farm fields, and do you have any estimate of potential cost? Mr. Smith. We are working on providing an estimate of that through a study with Purdue University at this time. Mr. Kucinich. Would you produce that to the subcommittee when that is done? Mr. Smith. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. You testified, ``Increased dicamba usage, made possible through the introduction of dicamba-tolerant soybeans, is poor public policy and shouldn't be allowed.'' Is there is a technological fix to the collateral harm you foresee occurring, such as having Monsanto develop dicamba- resistant fruit trees, melons, peas and tomatoes; is that the path we should take? Mr. Smith. From a consumer standpoint, that is a path we cannot take. Mr. Kucinich. Why? Mr. Smith. There is consumer resistance to the consumption of genetically modified crops. Mr. Kucinich. Why? Mr. Smith. I am not an expert to answer that. Mr. Kucinich. You don't have to answer. Mr. Miller, your testimony explains that the dicamba/ Roundup soybean is designed to ``give growers more weed control options.'' It sounds somewhat artful. It sounds like an artful way of saying that farmers can't rely on Roundup to control weeds anymore, so they now need to use another pesticide. Is it your belief, Mr. Miller, that the best solution to Roundup resistance in weeds is a farmer using another pesticide? Mr. Miller. I would say my belief, a broad array of university scientists, other industry scientists, the Weed Science Society of America, believes that adding multiple modes of action into an agricultural production system is good agricultural practice, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you. Mr. Freese, is the only or best way to control weeds after Roundup resistance has set in more and more chemicals and new chemical-tolerant crops? Mr. Freese. I think that is actually a very dangerous path to take. Mr. Kucinich. Why? Mr. Freese. We are learning lots of new things about weed resistance, and new mechanisms are being discovered all of the time. Mr. Kucinich. Why is it dangerous? You used the word ``dangerous.'' What do you mean? Mr. Freese. I think it is dangerous because it is going to lead to greater resistance down the line. Mr. Kucinich. How do you know that? Mr. Freese. Because what we have seen is an increase in multiple herbicide-resistant weeds already. Mr. Kucinich. So you use more chemicals. And we had testimony earlier from Ann Wright about the evolution of crops that contain herbicide resistance generally, right? Mr. Freese. Yes. So, for instance, in the eighties and nineties, a popular class of herbicides was called the ALS inhibitor. Mr. Kucinich. And ALS stands for? Mr. Freese. Acetolactate synthase. And they generated a huge expanse of herbicide-resistant weeds, and those resistant weeds were one reason farmers adopted Roundup Ready crops. Now we are getting weed populations that are resistant to both herbicides. In Missouri and Illinois, we have weed populations resistant to three and four different herbicides. Mr. Kucinich. For those who are not initiated, what are the implications of that? Draw out for us the practical implications that this scenario that you envision happening as a result of your scientific background--tell us where we are going. Mr. Freese. Well, we are headed toward more pesticide use, for one thing. That is pretty clear. At the last superweed hearing, one of the weed scientists spoke on the order of a percent increase in , -D and dicamba use soon after the introduction of the , -D and dicamba-resistant soybeans. Mr. Kucinich. What happens then? Mr. Freese. One thing is you have greater levels of these residues of these herbicides on the crop. A little-known fact about herbicide-resistant crops is the companies seek increases in what are called tolerances, the maximum allowable residue of the pesticide on the crop. We have seen that repeatedly with Roundup Ready, greatly increased glyphosate tolerances each time a new Roundup Ready crop is approved. Now, it is very troublesome when we think about that with more toxic herbicides like , -D and dicamba, both of which have been linked to cancer in pesticide applicators and farmers. , -D is a likely endocrine disrupter; that is, a disrupter of our hormone systems which are so important in controlling our development, our reproductive system, and our metabolism. EPA was supposed to start looking at endocrine effects on all of our pesticides in , but hasn't been funded to do that, and so it is only just now getting started. Mr. Kucinich. Are there any weed scientists to recommend an approach other than Monsanto's preference for dealing with weed resistance to their product Roundup. Mr. Freese. Can you restate that? Mr. Kucinich. Is there another approach that weed scientists would recommend in dealing with this problem of resistance? Mr. Freese. Yeah, and as a matter of fact, it's quite interesting because there is a technique that's long been used by organic growers, but also conventional growers. It involves planting winter cover crops. And basically it just--it means after harvest of the main crop, you can plant a cereal like rye, or a legume like hairy vetch or clover. And this cover crop grows in the fall, and then more in the spring, and it holds the soil, and it also absorbs excess nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizer. And then in the spring, it's killed off and forms a thick mat into which you can plant your main crop, that mat suppresses weeds physically. Sometimes the cover crop also releases chemicals that inhibit the growth of weeds. It's a very, very beneficial practice, because again, it's effective--it effectively suppresses weeds and provides multiple other benefits as well. Mr. Kucinich. All right. I want to thank you for answering that. Did you want to add something, Mr. Vroom? Mr. Vroom. Yes, Mr. Chairman. So we've delved into a lot of detail, but one important broad category of differentiation among weed control with regard to crop protection products is whether the chemistry is used after the weeds emerge, are sprayed on to the weeds, or it's applied to the soil as a pre- emergent control product. The ALS herbicide Mr. Freese is talking about are pre- emergent products, they are applied to the soil before the crop is planted. And so the--while the registrants for those chemicals that are pre-emergent products oftentimes do have protective tolerance levels, should some tiny amount be left in the soil and then get into the crop plant, there's virtually no evidence of residual in the actual crop from those kinds of products that are applied by the farmers. So big difference there between the technologies that all herbicides aren't applied the same way. And again, I think we come back to the industry, farmers, the USDA and the extension are all looking at redeploying a lot of old technologies--I'm certain that Monsanto and others have already reinvented some of the formulation technologies so that it can be better managed than it was when that particular product was more prominently used. And so it's all part of the solution, and I think what you're drawing out here is that we all have to work together, reinvent old products, because we also have evidence, and I've got a study here that I would also like to ask you to consider submitting into the record by---- Mr. Kucinich. You can submit it. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Vroom.

And so it's just a reminder that while our research goes on, we found the ease to discover and most broad spectrum efficacious herbicides, and now we're needing--now we're looking for things that are much more targeted and the need to reinvent the older products that are proven safe that can be reformulated and applied by farmers in different ways. Thank you. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much. I would just like to say in response to the point that you raise something that's obvious, that we're really probing here into cause and effect. Some causal chains begin in nature. With biotechnology and genetic engineering, some causal chains begin in the laboratory. So we just are trying to find out which way things are going here, and doing the best we can. Mr. Vroom. Thank you. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you for being here. I want to thank each of the witnesses. You've given this subcommittee additional information; we'll continue to seek more. We're going to do it in a dispassionate way. Just try to gather information so that we can recommend policies that would be in the best interest of all parties concerned. I do take note of Mr. Miller's testimony that government does have a role to play, it's not only the industry that's the question here, and I appreciate that you raise that. So without any further testimony, this is the Domestic Policy Subcommittee of Oversight and Government Reform. The subject of today's hearing ``Are `Superweeds' an Outgrowth of USDA Biotech Policy?'' This is the second part of this hearing. The subcommittee will continue to retain jurisdiction over this matter. I want to thank the staff for its presence here today and its participation in helping to structure this hearing. There being no--and thank the witnesses certainly. There being no further businesses before this subcommittee, this subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank you. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] [Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

Mr. Horn. This joint hearing of the House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology, and the House Subcommittee on Technology will come to order. It is now days into the new millennium. The lights are still on, telephones keep ringing, and the airplanes are still flying. So far, the biggest challenge, at least here on the east coast, is shoveling through the mountainous snowdrifts dumped by the first major storm of the year . Thanks to the hard work of thousands of dedicated people at a cost in the billions of dollars, we have the luxury of meeting today to discuss the benefits that have been derived from the year computer challenge. Over the past years, these subcommittees have spent countless hours examining the Federal Government's computer preparations for the year , or Y K. When we began this process in April , two Cabinet Secretaries had never heard of Y K, much less begun preparing for it. That ultimately changed, but not without congressional prodding through hearings and report cards, grading agencies on their progress. In addition to fixing all of the government's , mission-critical computer systems, the subcommittees expected agencies to develop viable contingency plans in case those computer fixes did not work. We prodded, we questioned, and we hoped for the best, and the best happened. The Federal Government experienced a successful transition into the new millennium. Some glitches did occur, however, giving cause to wonder what might have happened if the work had not been completed. I am inserting in the hearing record a statement stressing that without the work of many in the executive and legislative branches, it would not have been as successful. Without objection, that will be in the record at this point. The Defense Department had problems with its surveillance satellites. Some retailers were unable to process customer credit card purchases. A Chicago area bank was unable to process Medicare payments. As far as we know, those isolated problems were quickly repaired. Some still question whether other incidents might have occurred, but were unexpected due to a fix first, report later mentality. Successfully meeting the year challenge has provided many lessons that must not be ignored or forgotten. The unextendable deadline forced government leaders to focus on information technology issues. Program and technology personnel worked intensely and closely to get the job done. In addition, government agencies and private sector organizations were forced to develop detailed inventories of their technology resources and computer systems, in many cases for the first time. Unnecessary and obsolete systems have hopefully been discarded. Finally, government agencies and their partners have tested and retested data flows at unprecedented levels. Strong teamwork and rugged determination solved the year problem. Some critics now question whether the high cost of this massive effort was necessary. The best estimates currently indicate that the executive branch will spend more than $ billion on year fixes. The Secretary of Commerce has reported that the United States will have spent about $ billion on the effort as a whole. Was that money well spent? Of course it was. The executive branch of the Federal Government has not always been known as a careful steward of the citizens' money, regardless of what party is in power. Large corporations have waste also, and those that are publicly traded could not afford to squander hundreds of millions of dollars on unnecessary computer problems and contingency plans. Boards of directors and stockholders would not permit it. Whether large or small, successful businesses rarely fritter away money. This was a massive problem that required a massive solution. We are grateful to everyone who contributed the many ideas, solutions, and hard work that led to the success of this effort, from government personnel to grassroots organizations and the private sector. Thank you all for a job well done. Today we welcome some of those dedicated leaders. The Honorable John Koskinen, Assistant to the President and Chair of the President's Council on Year Conversion; Mr. Joel Willemssen, Director of Civil Agencies Information Systems for the General Accounting Office; the Honorable Charles Rossotti, Commissioner of Internal Revenue; Mr. Fernando Burbano, Chief Information Officer of the Department of State and cochairman of the Security Privacy and Infrastructure Committee of the Chief Information Officer Council; Mr. Harris Miller, president of Information Technology Association of America; Ms. Kathy Hotka, vice president for Information Technology of the National Retail Federation; and, last, Mr. Gary Beach, publisher of the CIO Communications, Inc. I might say that is a very distinguished magazine, and I read it regularly. We welcome each of you, and look forward to your testimony. It is a pleasure to first introduce Mr. John Koskinen, special assistant to the President, Chairman, President's Council on Year Conversion. [The prepared statement of Hon. Stephen Horn follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Horn. I now yield for opening statement from the cochairman of the task force, Mrs. Morella, the gentlewoman from Maryland. Mrs. Morella. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We will hear from Mr. Koskinen and the very prominent panel very shortly. I appreciate having this hearing. I think it is important that we look back at what has happened, and in particular, look ahead to the future. If I had told everyone in this room a month ago that in January the Federal Government would shut down for days and virtually the entire southeast and northeast would be crippled, most likely everyone would have immediately blamed Y K millennium bug and not mother nature. Yet it took a blizzard of snow and ice to accomplish what many doomsayers had predicted long ago for the millennium bug. So how is it that a winter storm caused more damage and inconveniences than the Y K problem? In the ensuing weeks since the passage of January , , similar questions have been posted. Was the Y K problem real or was it overhyped? Was the $ billion spent in the United States, roughly $ for every American citizen overall? Did all of our efforts stave off an impending disaster, or was Y K simply a nonevent waiting to happen? In my mind, there is no doubt the problem was real. From the very first hearing that my technology subcommittee conducted in the spring of , to right up to the final month of December , we witnessed systems failing Y K tests and crashing completely. Our concern for the Y K issue was initially so great and disturbing that we have held almost hearings in both the House and the Senate on the issue, which I understand makes Y K the single most thoroughly investigated issue ever in the history of congressional oversight. Ultimately, I believe two factors tipped the balance from the grave uncertainty many of us harbored in the beginning. The first was that we all knew the Y K problem would strike on a certain date, January , , thereby allowing us to collectively plan, coordinate and collaborate toward that deadline. The other and more significant factor was that after over a year and a half of persistent cajoling by Congress, after we realized this, our Nation required executive action to effectively combat the Y K problem, the President finally exercised his authority in the spring of . Y K was suddenly catapulted to become a top administration management priority, and John Koskinen was appointed to oversee our Federal Government's efforts and to partner with our Nation's private sector and with other countries internationally. John certainly deserves a great deal of accolades for his stewardship. The well-deserved cheers I wanted to point out to for our victory in vanquishing the millennium bug should also go to those who ably served in the front lines of this epic battle, all the dedicated Federal employees, public servants and professionals who were the technicians, and those who gave countless hours on their holidays to provide assurance to the American people that our Nation would be prepared for Y K. I think the fact that nothing of disastrous proportions happened does not mean that nothing would have happened. For example, the American Banking Association reported that, but for the $ billion in Y K fixes, mortgage calculations would have been incorrect, direct deposit of pay and government benefits would have been problematic, and credit cards could not be read due to problems with expiration dates. Similarly, the telecommunications industry reported that the $ . billion that they spent over the past to years prevented the potential gradual deterioration of public switch telephone network performance, including slow response times for dial tone access as well as interruptions of service. The result of our Y K experience is a testament to the fact that we prepared well and we invested properly. I believe, however, the investments were not just about Y K, but also about improving our Nation's information technology systems and gaining knowledge about those systems. That is the focus of our hearing today. This hearing is not designed to simply pat each other on the back or to allow our panelists to take a figurative victory lap around the witness table, but to ascertain the lessons that we learned from our Y K experience. Will Y K inspire a conscious effort for greater long-term planning and more reliable and secure technology, or will it just prolong the shortsighted thinking that made Y K so costly? While many systems have relays replaced, some programs were fixed by applying a Y K patch that will require another round of fixes within the next two decades. I look forward to addressing these and many other issues with our distinguished panel of witnesses, most of whom have appeared before us on many occasions. It is only appropriate that since this is the absolutely positively final last and ultimate hearing of the House Y K Task Force, we close with those who have been involved with this issue since the very beginning. Perhaps this hearing can provide the foundation for initiatives as we address the -digit computer date problem, Y K as it may come to be known. If so at that time, maybe Steve Horn and I can chair that task force, along with Strom Thurmond in the Senate. I would like to extend my deep appreciation to all the members of my technology subcommittee and Congressman Horn's government management subcommittee and his leadership for the years of vigilant and cooperative bipartisan initiatives, and I especially want to acknowledge the hard work of my ranking member, Jim Barcia, and certainly Chairman Horn, the distinguished cochair of the task force, and Jim Turner of the government management subcommittee, ranking member, and the members of both subcommittees who have been very dedicated, and I yield back. Thank you. Mr. Horn. We thank you so much for your nice words for all the Members, and all of our witnesses. We agree with you, and I am delighted to now yield to the gentleman who has been here right from the beginning of his duties as the ranking member on the side of the subcommittee on government management, Mr. Turner from Texas. We are delighted you could make it out of the snow, if you have any down there, and into Washington for this meeting. So thank you very much for all you have done to help us in the field hearings and everywhere else. Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When I left Texas the other day, it was degrees. I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairwoman Morella, for the good work you have done. This task force and these two committees were about a \ / \-year project. As I recall, my staff advised me we had different hearings of this subcommittee alone on this subject. Many observers say that the Y K problem was the greatest management challenge the Federal Government has faced, and perhaps that is true. I think most of us had a high degree of confidence after the many hearings that we had that we would make it through January st without great problems, but nobody really knew for sure. The fact we did make it I am sure is due, in large part, to the hard work you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairwoman Morella, have made in an effort to make sure the Federal Government is ready. I also want to commend the ranking member of the science subcommittee, Mr. Barcia, and I want to thank Mr. Williamson. He worked very diligently, met with this committee time and time again, and I think, in large part, usual efforts helped us get to where we needed to go. Of course, Mr. Koskinen and the President's Y K council, I think, did an outstanding job. I really felt sorry for you when I was watching you on television on New Year's Day and you kept holding these press conferences with nothing to say. That is the worst nightmare of any politician, that somehow we would have a press conference and there is nothing to say. But you seemed to have survived it well, and you and your council did an outstanding job working not only with the public sector and Federal agencies, but reaching out to the private sector to ensure that we got to where we needed to go. That is not to say there weren't significant potential problems. As I recall from many of our hearings, we tried to ask witnesses that came before us to tell us what they fixed, what would happen if they had not been diligent about remediation of their Y K problems, and some of the stories we heard clearly convinced me that all of the effort and all of the work that took place was needed, did accomplish the desired result, and the fact that we had no great crisis on January was to the credit of all of those many thousands of people who spent countless hours and millions of dollars to remediate the problem. We are here today not to congratulate ourselves, but to look back and to review the results of our efforts, to see what lessons we have learned. I feel confident we are better prepared as a Nation to meet a future national emergency than we have ever been in terms of keeping our computer systems working, which, of course, every facet of our life now depends upon our computers working well. So I think we are going to have a good hearing today, and I appreciate all the witnesses being here. Again, I would like to thank Chairman Horn and Chairwoman Morella for the good work that you did. Mr. Horn. Well, thank you very much. You have sure been with us since the ground floor, and we have another person who has been with us ever since she has been elected to Congress, and the gentlewoman from Illinois, Mrs. Biggert, we have held hearings in her area, which is a wonderful suburb outside of Chicago, and we appreciate your regular attendance at these meetings and the contributions you have made in staff meetings and Member meetings. So thank you very much for coming to this hearing. The gentlewoman from Illinois, Mrs. Biggert. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you, Chairman Horn and Chairwoman Morella. Let me thank you for calling this hearing on the impact of the Y K date change. Contrary to what some people felt might happen, the planes didn't fall from the sky when the clock struck midnight, telephones retained their dial tones, water still ran from the faucets and America's New Year's celebrations were not left in the dark. So I think we had a good new year. But remarkably, and a little bit surprisingly, substantial Y K problems were not experienced out of this country either, despite the lack of preparation on the part of some of the nations' computers and other essential services across the globe. We really saw no major disruptions. But as this committee heard numerous times during its hearings, Y K-related glitches could have had a substantial and extremely negative impact on the variety of services, the smooth turnover from into is directly related, I think, to the billions of dollars and hundreds of man-hours directed toward preventing and correcting potential Y K problems. I think it goes without saying that from what we have seen, or seen thus far relating to Y K disruptions, that these efforts paid off handsomely. Y K preparations paid off in other ways as well as a result of the Y K concerns; there are now thousands more American families that own the equipment, such as generators needed to prepare for other types of emergencies, namely snowstorms, floods and hurricanes. All of my family, even my -month-old grandson, now have new flashlights and fresh new batteries. Government leaders on every level now have a better understanding of technology, management issues and are aware of the importance of cooperation between local, State and Federal officials. What is more, the millennium bug provided a reason to upgrade government technology systems and to inventory resources. So just being able to say some weeks after the year rollover, it turned out to be a positive experience, that is a testament to the hard work of the House Y K task force and to the leadership of Chairman Horn and Chairman Morella, and it is also a testament to the efforts of today's witnesses, particularly Mr. Koskinen and Mr. Willemssen and the others at the General Accounting Office. Your work over the last--at least years in raising awareness and highlighting the potential problems related to the Y K date change is to be recognized and commended. I don't want to leave you with the impression that Y K glitches didn't occur. In fact, at least one bank in my home State of Illinois did experience some Y K problems when it was temporarily unable to make some Medicare transactions. The Federal Government, I don't think, was immune either. Three of the Federal Housing Administration mission-critical systems experienced problems shortly after January st. So we are here today really, I think, to see if there are any outstanding Y K issues and to sort out what went right and what went wrong, and to help the American people understand what transpired on January , , and let them know about the significant long-term benefits this situation provided to our government and to private industry. So, again, I commend the men for calling the hearing today and for all the work you have both done on this important issue and look forward to hearing from the witnesses. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Hon. Judy Biggert follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Horn. Well, thank you very much. I now yield to the gentleman from Oregon, Mr. Walden, who has been with us in field hearings and a faithful worker in the very active work of these subcommittees. Mr. Walden, the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. Walden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to extend my appreciation to the work you have done and others on this committee certainly for bird-dogging this issue throughout the last year or more. I think in large measure, the report cards that you issued were a very positive step in not only notifying our own agencies, but the world, where we stood and proved to be a very effective technique for spurring on the changes that needed to be made to cope with the Y K issue. In my other life, I was a small business owner, and I can tell you Y K was not a cheap thing to go through. Our own little company spent well over $ , in upgrading software. I know that I am not alone in the small business community in that respect. So there was an enormous amount of capital spent to deal with this issue, and hopefully the programmers who will deal with the K issue, I won't have to help pay for them down the road. But I think it was an excellent exercise. I think it forced both of us in both the government and private industry to do an incredible amount of improvement to our software and to our hardware. That should help us down the road in a competitive status as well. So, Mr. Chairman, I again want to thank you for your tireless efforts to make that the country was ready, and I look forward to hearing from our panelists as well. Thank you. Mr. Horn. I thank the gentleman for your kindness. The next gentleman has also been very active since he has come here in the last election, Mr. Green of Wisconsin, Mark Green. He has been faithfully working on some of these problems and has a whole series of other things he wants us to consider too, and we will. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no comments at this time, but will look forward to the testimony. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. Now it is a great pleasure to present the person that put the executive branch together, where it was no question it wasn't going anywhere until the President picked Mr. Koskinen out of retirement, who delayed his trip to France to have time for retirement after his position as Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget. You did a great job, John, and we are delighted to have you here with your thoughts as to what happened and what did we learn from it, and what can we use from it. STATEMENTS OF JOHN KOSKINEN, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ON YEAR CONVERSION; JOEL C. WILLEMSSEN, DIRECTOR, CIVIL AGENCIES INFORMATION SYSTEMS, U.S. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE; CHARLES ROSSOTTI, COMMISSIONER, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE; AND FERNANDO BURBANO, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, DEPARTMENT OF STATE Mr. Koskinen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. I am pleased to appear once again before this joint session of the subcommittees to discuss the activities of the President's Council on Year Conversion and the Nation's successful transition to the year . With your permission, I will submit my full statement to the record and summarize it here. I appreciate everyone's kind comments and would like to acknowledge as well the work of your subcommittees in helping to prepare the Federal Government and the country for the century date change. I appreciate your work and I think it deserves recognition as we look back on what has been truly a remarkable effort. I continued to believe that Y K was the greatest management challenge the world has faced in the last years. Given the size of the task, it is easy to understand why just or years ago many serious people who had looked at the situation maintained there was no way the work could be finished in time. When I returned to the government in March to work on Y K, things were fairly grim. The consensus was the government wouldn't make it. In the private sector, information bottlenecks were widespread and companies weren't saying much about their own readiness for Y K. On top of all that, the World Bank released a study showing that three-quarters of the world's countries had no Y K plans at all. In short, Y K looked too mammoth, too complicated and too interconnected to be solvable. Now, almost years later, the United States and much of the world have made the transition into the year with few problems that have had a noticeable impact on the general public. How did it hatch? It wasn't by accident. There was a tremendous mobilization of people and resources to make sure that systems would operate effectively into the year . Domestically, participants in key infrastructure sectors, such as electric power, telecommunications finance and transportation devoted great attention and resources to the problem, and as we moved to the ends of the year, operators of systems in those areas stated they were basically done with their Y K work. We reported this information in our last quarterly assessment, and, as we expected, there were no major infrastructure failures, nationally or regionally in the United States. The Federal Government was also ready for the year . Two weeks before the new year, . percent of the government's more than , mission-critical systems were Y K ready. The result was that while it has been noted there have been some glitches, thus far Y K issues have not affected the major government services and benefits provided to the American people. Internationally, after a slow start, countries made a concerted effort to ensure that critical issues would be ready for the date change and, as a general matter, major infrastructure systems abroad functioned smoothly during the rollover. There is general agreement that the Y K transition went more smoothly than any of us would have imagined. In fact, as noted in the week since the rollover, some people have suggested that Y K was an insignificant problem, hyped by the media, computer consultants and those with other reasons for hoping the world as we know it was about to end. The short answer is that I don't know of a single person working on Y K who thinks that they did not confront and avoid a major risk of systemic failure. Indeed, some of the noteworthy problems we have seen from difficulties at State motor vehicle offices to credit card processing problems to its Defense Department satellite system failure, proved that Y K was a very real threat indeed. While I do not think that the significance of the Y K problems was exaggerated, there were those who disagreed with our reports indicating that the problem was being successfully addressed. This form of hype can be traced to the skepticism and disbelief in some quarters that companies or governments reporting on their own progress could be telling the truth. In the United States, I kept reminding my doomsayer friends that it made no sense to discount these reports, since everyone who was in a position of responsibility would be easily found after January . Many continued to assume the worst would materialize, some now discounting the significance of the Y K threat point to the relative lack of major disruptions abroad. How did countries that appeared to have spent so little and were thought to be relatively unprepared emerge unscathed? Here, I think, there were a number of factors at work. Chief among them was the difficulty of getting accurate status reports, especially internationally on a fast-moving issue such as Y K. Information months old was out-of-date. But in the absence of additional details, people often relied on that older information, and then were surprised when it turned out to have been overtaken by subsequent progress. Additionally, once you get beyond the world's largest users of information technology, countries like the United States, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom, the reliance upon information technology drops off quickly. Furthermore, the technology being used in other countries is more likely to be off the shelf and not customized applications that are more difficult to fix. Finally, countries starting later had the benefits of the lessons learned by those working on Y K for several years. We spent a lot of time in the last months encouraging the sharing of technical information about problems, products, fixes and testing techniques, and I think it is obvious that worked paid off. So what lessons can we draw from the Y K experience? First, Y K has taught us that top management needs to be more involved in information technology on an ongoing basis, since information technology cuts to the very heart of how organizations conduct their business. In many companies, it was only when the board of directors or the chief executive officer took ownership of the problem that we could see the first signs of any real progress. Y K has also shown us that we need to do a better job of configuration management, in other words, keeping track of the technology we use and the functions it performs. Y K provided many large firms a reason to conduct, for the first time ever, a comprehensive inventory of their information technology infrastructure and processes. Not surprisingly, organizations found that some systems could be discarded without any loss in productivity. Other systems were replaced by newer, more efficient models. Third, Y K has demonstrated the value of forming partnerships across traditional boundaries to achieve a common goal. In addition to showing us the increasing interconnectedness of organizations through technology, Y K highlighted the fact that private industry and government can work together to address major national issues. I think that spirit of partnership obviously extended to the political arena as well. Most people realized early on there was not a Democratic or Republican solution to this problem, and we really have worked well together, particularly in the partnership that led to the passage of the Year Information Readiness and Disclosure Act in . Finally, I think that Y K has demonstrated that we need to include the American public in the discussions about any future large-scale challenges. Given the facts, whatever they are, people generally responded appropriately. Even when industry and government information provided to the public revealed that there was still substantial work left to do, people were reassured rather than alarmed. They seemed comforted to know their organizations were treating the problem seriously, were working together to solve it, and would keep them informed with the status of the situation. The President's Council will soon cease its operations. Before we post the going-out-of-business sign, we will focus on monitoring activities during the leap year rollover. We do not expect any major national problems and we anticipate the Council will shut down for good by the end of March. In closing, I would like to echo the comments made that the Federal Government and the country's successful resolution of the Y K problem attributes to the skill, dedication and hard work of thousands of professionals that have focused on this issue. It has been my pleasure to assist them as part of this vital national effort, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have at the conclusion of the other statements. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Koskinen follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Horn. We will go down, as you know, with this panel and then open it up to questions, because I think some of the information will jibe and some won't. The gentleman from the General Accounting Office, Mr. Joel Willemssen, the Director of Civil Agencies Information Systems, Accounting and Information Management Division. Mr. Willemssen has gone all over the United States with the subcommittee on government management and has been an active participant in the various panels we have had of government officials, private sector and so on. So it is a pleasure to have you here. I know you were working right up to midnight there, as I saw you in John's command center. So we appreciate all you have done and your team at the General Accounting Office. Mr. Willemssen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Chairwoman Morella, Ranking Member Turner, members of the subcommittees, thank you for inviting us to testify today. As requested, I will summarize our statement. Overall, during the rollover period, our country had relatively few Y K-related errors that affected the delivery of key services. While the Y K challenge is not yet over, because some key business processes have not yet been fully executed and some risky dates remain, the Nation's success thus far is a very positive indicator that these hurdles will also be overcome. The leadership exhibited by the legislative and the executive branches and the partnerships formed by numerous organizations were pivotal factors behind the success. The Y K-related errors that were experienced during the rollover generally did not affect the delivery of key services because they were either corrected quickly or contingency plans were implemented. A key reason that Y K errors had little effect on the delivery of services is that Federal agencies and other organizations used the rollover weekend to identify and correct errors before the problems resulted in operational consequences. In the Federal Government, the few Y K disruptions that were significant were mitigated by quick action. For example, the Department of Defense, Health Care Financing Administration and Federal Aviation Administration each experienced significant Y K events that they were able to address quickly. For high impact State-administered problems such as Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance, actions by States and the Federal Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Labor have paid off. Errors reported were often cosmetic printing or display problems with few failures resulting in disruptions to service. The threat posed by Y K was a much needed wake-up call for organizations to improve their management of information technology. Y K has laid a foundation for longer term improvements in the way that Federal Government manages information technology. I would like to quickly summarize some of the key lessons that we have learned out of the Y K experience. First, as mentioned, one of the most important factors underpinning the success of Y K was leadership at the highest levels of government. In particular, congressional oversight played a central role in pushing agencies forward on Y K. Mr. Koskinen and the President's Y K Council provided strong effective leadership. Second, Y K served as a notice to many on how much we rely on information technology to deliver key services. Third, there was standard guidance that was put together that was universally accepted, adopted and implemented, which facilitated Y K efforts and oversight. Such guidance provided consistency, imposed structure and discipline and enhanced the rigor of testing and assessment efforts. Fourth, as Mr. Koskinen mentioned, the establishment of partnerships among various organizations was especially important. In particular, the partnerships formed by Mr. Koskinen, Federal agencies and private sector organizations were instrumental to the Nation's Y K efforts. Fifth, we found that using standard techniques and metrics to monitor performance was especially helpful in measuring progress and remaining challenges. Finally, Y K saw many agencies take charge of their information technology resources in much more active ways. In many instances, it forced agencies to inventory their systems and to link those systems to agencies' core business processes. Also the development and testing of contingency plans should have benefits way beyond Y K. Further, Y K prompted agencies to establish needed policies in areas such as configuration management, risk management and software testing. In summary, the Y K rollover was clearly a success for our Nation. A key challenge now for the Federal Government is ensuring that the lessons learned in addressing Y K can be effectively used to improve overall information technology management. That concludes the summary of my statement. Thank you very much. Mr. Horn. I thank you very much. We have a lot to pursue in your very fine document here as to what did go wrong.

It is always a pleasure to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue here. We will see you again on April th. We would love to hear your statement, because you had a lot of burdens counting on it, people that wanted refunds and all the rest of it. So thank you, Commissioner, for being here. Mr. Rossotti. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good to be here. Madam Chairman and distinguished Members, I am very pleased to report that the IRS experienced a smooth Y K rollover starting on December th and continuing up to the present with fewer problems this January than we normally experience in a normal January. To date, we have had good success. It was hard work and our success can be attributed to the comprehensive planning and preparations we have conducted over the last \ / \ years. We also are very grateful for the guidance and assistance you provided, your committee, as well as Mr. Koskinen and GAO. I do want to note we cannot yet declare total victory on Y K at the IRS. Some risks do remain, and in particular, we have to be very vigilant about Y K problems that could still crop up during our high volume tax filing season, which really starts in February and continues through April. As I discussed in previous hearings, the scope of the Y K problem at the IRS was enormous and required a significant investment, about $ . billion, to plan and prepare. But fortunately, that investment was made. Had we not adequately prepared for Y K, I think it is fair to say the tax system of the United States would simply have ground to a halt. In my written testimony, I described several scenarios for today, I picked out a few of the events that would have occurred. For example, our -year-old system for entering data from paper tax returns would have stopped working if we had simply allowed it to roll over without modification. This particular combination of hardware, software and third-party products could not be renovated, and therefore, was totally redesigned and replaced during and . Without this system, about million individual income tax returns that come in on paper would have just been piling up right now. Second, interest and penalty calculations would have been incorrect and would have generated wrong notices to taxpayers. For example, if we had not replaced the system, we would have sent about million wrong notices to taxpayers telling them that they owe money to the IRS. Those numbers would have been wrong. Third, our data transfers with important external organizations such as the financial management service and the Federal Reserve Bank would have failed because of incompatible dates. This would have impaired or eliminated the ability to issue about million refunds. Just a final example, I think this is particularly interesting, and certainly not unexpected, but after years of fixing and testing these systems, we did one final end-to-end test that was completed about the middle of December. This particular final end-to-end test identified problems. Some of those would have been very serious had we not fixed them at the end. For example, a system that generates new balance notices to taxpayers for certain tax periods was displaying the date as instead of for some of those notices. So if this problem had not been fixed, we would have been sending out hundreds of thousands of notices to taxpayers with incorrect tax periods and wrong payment dates that would have generated mass confusion among those taxpayers, and this was just only one example. There are many more scenarios in my written testimony. Of course, none of these things actually did happen, and that was simply because we acted in time to solve the problems. Now, the question is sometimes asked in the form of was Y K a blessing in disguise? I would have to say that I would not consider it to have been a blessing, whether it was disguised or not disguised, but there are some important residual benefits in the IRS that we will realize from the investment. I will mention the four most important. The first is we did replace a lot of obsolete hardware and system software products. As a result of the Y K program, most of our hardware in the IRS has been replaced, since most of it was really obsolete, and software releases have been brought up-to-date. This bringing up-to-date of this infrastructure is essential for supporting what we are now embarked on, our technology modernization program, and, of course, it is imperative that we have adequate annual replacements of hardware and regular routine upgrades of software releases in order to keep this vast installed base up-to-date. Second, we did implement some very important improvements in our program management practices. Our Y K program was successful largely because effective program management practices were implemented over the last years. These practices will be extremely valuable as we now move forward with our technology modernization program. I do want to note as challenging as Y K was, our modernization program imposes even more and different challenges because it involves major business changes as well as technology. Third, we were able to standardize many products. The IRS- installed base of hardware and software was not only obsolete, it was heterogeneous in the extreme. The Y K program has allowed us to set up and largely implement standard products. Because of our reorganization under the leadership of our CIO, Paul Cosgrave, we now have the management structure and delegated authority in place to make design and procurement decisions to maintain standardization of technology. Finally, we implemented improved inventory management. GAO has justly criticized the IRS for years for the poor condition of our IT inventory. Because of Y K, we were forced to examine our inventory and bring it up-to-date as never before. So the condition of our inventory records is greatly improved, although I have to note it is still not fully where it needs to be, and there is much that needs to be done in the future on that problem. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, we are gratified with our results. I stress there are still some risks that remain. Clearly, we gained some residual benefits which will be of great value as we proceed to our even more challenging business system modernization programs. These benefits will only be realized if we actively continue the practices established during Y K, including regular replacement and upgrades of hardware and software. We will keep the subcommittees apprised of any remaining problems and our actions to correct them. I thank you for the opportunity to discuss our efforts, and certainly thank you for your interest and support over the last years. Mr. Horn. Well, we thank you very much.

As Mr. Koskinen leaves the scene, there is no question in my mind the toughest job in the executive branch is the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. If anybody is going to turn that agency around, you are. So, thank you. The last witness on this panel is Mr. Fernando Burbano, the Chief Information Officer of the Department of State. We are glad to have you here. Mr. Burbano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Madam Chairwoman and distinguished members of both committees. Since my oral testimony is limited to minutes, my written testimony includes more detail. As chairman of the CIO Council Subcommittee on Critical Infrastructure Protection, I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss how lessons learned, products and processes developed in support of Y K, can be leveraged into our ongoing critical infrastructure security efforts and challenges facing Federal agencies in implementing security pleasures. As well, in my role as CIO of the State Department, I would like to thank you for providing me this opportunity to talk about the results and continuing impacts of the Department's successful Y K preparation efforts. The Department of State, along with rest of the Federal Government, showed just how powerful and effective we can be when we are singularly focused and committed to solving a problem and are provided the necessary resources to get the job done. First, let me quickly address the cost of preparing for Y K. The question is, did we spend too much? The answer is very simple: Absolutely not. We should be careful not to confuse the lack of catastrophic disruptions with unnecessary preparations by the Federal Government. Now, moving on to the actual results of the Y K rollover and its impacts to the global community. In general, there are few and only minor Y K failures reported internationally, and none that impacted the safety of American citizens worldwide. I believe this global success is a direct result of the U.S. Government's international outreach and awareness campaign led by the Department of State, the Department of Defense and the President's Council on the Y K Conversion, in coordination with the United Nations and World Bank. Embassies representing the U.S. presence in over countries around the world played a key role in monitoring and reporting events in their host countries and post facilities through a Y K task force convened in State's operations center. Additionally, internal State Department systems fared exceptionally well throughout the rollover, experiencing no significant failures among our mission critical, critical and routine systems. As you are well aware, many of the products and processes developed to address Y K problems can be applied to future challenges and serve as the foundation for managing issues with cross-agency and public-private boundaries, including critical infrastructure protection. In fact, much of the work already done is a prerequisite for PDD , critical infrastructure protection, Clinger-Cohen, and other government performance results act initiatives. Specifically, Y K preparation forced government agencies to take a close look at its IT applications and produce a complete prioritized inventory. This is a critical first step to identifying and refining the mission essential infrastructure as required by PDD . The Y K effort produced program management methodologies which were applied across all government agencies and included executive and congressional oversight, Assistant Secretary level management and repeatable standardized measures and processes. This management structure can also be applied to critical infrastructure protection. All elements of the Federal Government reviewed and developed contingency plans for critical business processes. The development of these contingency plans resulted in a greater understanding by senior policy managers of the dependency of business processes on IT systems. Additionally, these plans are durable beyond Y K established a foundation for all future contingency operations planning. For the Y K rollover period, the government developed a robust global reporting structural which can be leveraged into a mechanism for monitoring threats against critical infrastructure elements. For example, within the Department of State, we have developed a web-based geographic information system to collect cyber-threat information from all overseas posts. This tool can serve as a pilot system for other agencies to collect and analyze cyber-threat data. Finally, Y K preparation efforts increased the level of interagency cooperation and coordination between the public and private sectors. The same working level teamwork will be required to effectively implement critical infrastructure protection plans. There are two areas which I believe allow the Federal Government to successfully overcome widespread Y K problems in the face of an unmovable tight deadline. First, continued participation by key congressional oversight organizations provided Federal Y K programs the authority needed to push agency resources to their limits. Second, the ability of Federal Y K programs to rapidly obtain and more importantly retain adequate separate supplemental funding, specifically designated for Y K, allowed each agency to acquire the resources necessary to achieve the time sensitive objectives. This ability of Federal agencies to have access to a congressionally managed yet continuous separate supplemental funding stream designated specifically for the Y K effort allowed Federal CIOs and Y K program managers the ability to acquire and retain qualified resources in the needed quantity. Critical infrastructure protection requires the same approach. Involvement by Congress and other oversight organizations to raise the level of awareness and visibility throughout the Federal community and overseas CIP implementation in support of national security goals is vital, and this activity is already underway. But just as important to me and my colleagues through our government is access to funding which allows each of us to begin developing and implementing our plans in accordance with PDD and other critical infrastructure protection guidance and statutes. One of the key obstacles preventing agencies from immediately pursuing CIP initiatives is the lack of current funding for these projects. Due to the Federal Government's budget cycle, forecasting the future work is done years prior to the budget year. Therefore, as new requirements are levied, current agency budgets do not reflect changing priorities and requirements, such as the need for critical infrastructure protection implementation initiative. In light of this, there are numerous events that have prevented agencies from adequately addressing current CIP implementation requirements in their fiscal year and fiscal year budgets. First, the unprecedented and unpredictable growth of Internet use and technologies over the last years; second, the corresponding collateral growth of the cyber underworld during this same period; third, the extent to which our daily business relies on Internet-based systems and the fundamental shift of business tools to be used in a web-based environment; finally, expanding CIP requirements on Federal agencies, including the recent critical infrastructure plan released and its programs, some of which require immediate implementation. These are just some of the reasons why Federal agencies are poorly positioned to successfully implement critical infrastructure to address the challenge posed by the ever- growing cyber underworld, not to mention to be in compliance with executive guidance. Although we of the CIO council fully understand fiscal constraints, reallocation of such a fraction of the current surplus would be a solid investment for the protection of the Federal Government's critical infrastructure. In closing, it is my belief and the belief of members of my subcommittee and CIO's across the Federal Government that in order for the national CIP initiatives to be fully successful, continued congressional support as well as the ability to get access to specific CIP and security-related funding is vital. I cannot emphasize that without congressional-backed support, including adequate funding, we on the subcommittee of the critical infrastructure committee believe that the government will significantly fall short of national critical infrastructure protection goals. Thank you. Mr. Horn. We thank you very much for that statement. [The prepared statement of Mr. Burbano follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

We are sure there will be questions for every witness. I am going to start with the cochairman of the task force, the gentlewoman from Maryland, to begin the questioning. It will be limited to minutes by each Member, and it will alternate between those who have not had a chance, starting with Mr. Turner after the gentlewoman from Maryland. Mrs. Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I hear from all of you some of the same results assessments. First of all, you became more familiar in your various agencies, departments, groups with whom you work, with information technology and its role in the future. Second, there was an assessment of the systems that you have, so you are ready to move ahead with information technology. Also, I think, rising to the forefront is the concept of the partnerships, partnerships within the Federal Government, the executive branch, legislative branch, but also partnerships with the private sector, partnerships with local governments. I think that is something that we could all learn from and hope to continue to preserve. We also--I think you all said you felt this was very important and that it did prevent some big problems. My two questions I am going to meld into one because of the time constraints. First of all, I am surprised myself that there weren't some problems with the Pakistans of this world, Russia. They didn't seem to have any major problems. These are places with older computer systems. I just wondered if you all were surprised at the lack of the problems we have heard about emanating from those countries and other countries that would be in the same category? Second part, as we look to leap year, February th, do you foresee any major or minor problems? Is there something we should be doing about that? I guess I could start then with Chairman Koskinen. Mr. Koskinen. Well, as I noted in my testimony, I think things did go better abroad than anyone had expected. Partially, though, I think that is because we fell prey to what I thought people did here, which is we didn't believe other countries when they gave us their progress reports. In the last months of the year, country after country issued reports that didn't say there wasn't a problem, but basically said they identified the places where they needed to apply resources; they had done that effectively and they were prepared. We all sort of said it was late in the day, are they really prepared? It turned out they were, for a number of reasons that I discussed. One is, a lot of them had much less reliance on information technology, certainly in their infrastructure, than we do here. In fact, I think there are a relatively small number of countries in the world that have complicated computerized control systems for their infrastructure that put them at risk. So a lot of countries discovered that the embedded-chips did not create a problem for their infrastructure. In fact, in the last quarter of last year, we noted, based on testimony and information from industry experts, that it was unlikely that the lights would go out anywhere or that a dial tone would stop anywhere, that the risk in infrastructure systems with embedded systems was gradual degradation of service over a period of time. So in the countries that we knew were in the middle--the truly developing countries have very little IT and were at risk primarily in financial systems, it was the Pakistans, Indonesias, Russias, Chinas of the world--that had a reasonable reliance on information technology, where people were concerned about how much they had done. I think it is a combination of the fact that they started late, but they spent a lot of time in the last to months working hard on it. They got the benefit of learning from everybody else. There was a tremendous amount of information exchanged as we moved through it, and third, a lot of their systems are still analog, they are not digital. They did not depend upon new digitalized equipment, and therefore, they were able to prioritize their resources in a much more focused way. But I would emphasize that the image of those countries, as if they didn't do anything, they were unconcerned and just waited around, was wrong. We met with country delegates in June at the United Nations, and every one of those countries understood this was a problem that, in some degree, affected them. Every one of those countries was then focused on Y K, every country met at least twice in every region of the world cooperating, or most of the countries did, cooperating, sharing information. So I think what happened was in that last months far more work was done in a very focused, effective way than any of us were able to get a window on. With regard to February th, it has turned out in testing, certainly in the Federal systems and in the private sector, that there have been more mistakes than one would have thought. You would have thought people would have gotten the right result for the wrong reason, which is, they didn't understand the rule of centuries, they just divided by and figured out the year was a leap year. It turned out there were a reasonable number of programmers that had just enough information to be dangerous, which is, they knew centuries generally aren't leap years, they just didn't know the rule of the exception divisible by . So this is primarily a software problem, although there were some potential embedded chip and system operations problems. Our judgment is we will see no more glitches than we saw on January , which were relatively minor and modest. We are going to monitor it for two reasons. One is we think it is important for those who are operating systems to understand it is a real problem and there is still time for them to test their systems. Most major companies have already done that. Second, it will be important to monitor the days: the th, th and st of March, so the glitches that occur, and I think inevitably there will be some, are put in the appropriate context. If we had not been able to identify the limited nature of the glitches as they occurred over that first or days on the rollover, we would have had a very different media response. When reports came in of legitimate glitches, the fact, we were able to confirm their accuracy, but expand by saying that is the only country in which it happened, or the only area that happened. It allowed us to put the glitch in the right context. Absent that, you would have had a greater likelihood of unnecessary overreaction by either the media or the public. We don't expect there will be many glitches, but we think it is important for the public to know where they are and what their significance is. Mrs. Morella. I would like to give you opportunity to respond, Mr. Burbano. Incidentally, I love that acronym for the critical infrastructure, CIAO. It is easy to remember. Mr. Burbano. Thank you. Working at the State Department, I had a great opportunity to actually go overseas to many of the countries and meet the John Koskinens of those countries and their sector leaders. I found two things quite interesting, and that is why I personally wasn't too surprised. One is in talking to them, I found out they were not as automated as some of the people thought they were. But more importantly, the culture in a lot of these countries is not to report the status of government systems, whether it is good or bad, believe it or not. But they will reveal more orally, which obviously when you try to track status, is the only thing that are looked at is written, and if you don't have information to provide, you assume the worst, and that is why they don't get reported as well. Those were the two reasons I found. Mrs. Morella. Like people say about the President, underestimate so that the results will be attributed to you, however it comes out. Mr. Horn. I thank the gentlewoman. I now yield to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Turner, the ranking member, minutes for questioning. Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Koskinen, I don't know if you have this information or are set up to collect it, but earlier we had a lot of dire predictions about lawsuits being filed all over the place regarding Y K problems, and I would be curious as to whether or not any of that has occurred and the degree to which that was a significance problem? Mr. Koskinen. Well, some of us maintained last year that you couldn't have massive lawsuits without having massive failures, and therefore, at least the President Council's position was there was not likely to be this flood of litigation, because there was not likely to be a flood of failures. That turns out to have been correct. There have been a relatively modest number, but significant lawsuits have been filed where people are arguing about who is going to pay for the fixes, and the question is whether insurance policies cover the failures that companies avoided, particularly in major companies in the United States. But as a general matter, in the absence of any very significant Y K failures since the st of the year, obviously, you can't have a lawsuit if you don't have somebody damaged in some way. So at this juncture, the only lawsuits out there are primarily focused on arguments between those who fixed the systems and primarily their insurance companies about who ought to pay for it. Even that is not anything like a flood of litigation. Mr. Turner. As I recall, of those issues that you mentioned regarding who should pay for fixing, it was not the subject of the litigation nor the success of the legislation that attracted so much attention in the Congress, because all issues were separate and aside from the issues that were dealt with in the Y K litigation. Mr. Koskinen. That is right. The legislation that the Congress passed primarily addressed the rights and responsibilities of potential plaintiffs and defendants if there were system failures, focused primarily on giving potential defendants the opportunity and the right to fix any of those failures within a defined period of time, and again, since there have been relatively few of those problems that amounted to much, there have been a lot of glitches along the way, there hasn't been much need for the legislation. But I am sure people would argue that since there were great risks, if we didn't get the work done, that there would be failures, there was some potential that the failures obviously would have generated litigation. The fact that we haven't had the failures has had the side effect that we are not going to much litigation. Mr. Turner. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. We are in the question period. Does the gentlewoman from Illinois have some questions? The gentlewoman is recognized for minutes. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you. As far as what is going to happen in the future, will there be a plan like continuation of your Council, or is there going to be an office that will remain after probably the leap year? Mr. Koskinen. Well, if there is, it won't have me in it. No, the Council will, as I noted, fold up its tent and fade away into the dusk, probably by the end of March. The issue going forward that Mr. Burbano noted that people are focused on is how will we deal with information technology security and threats to the critical infrastructure, and there is a Presidential decision directive, PDD , that sets out a structure and an organizational framework for dealing with those issues, coordinated by the National Security Council out of the White House. So that operation, while we have been coordinating very closely together over the last years, will continue, but it is already set up in the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Organization [CIAO], as Chairwoman Morella noted, and that will be separate from the President's Council. Mrs. Biggert. So there will no longer be a CIO czar? Mr. Koskinen. That is right. I never saw myself as the CIO czar. The CIOs actually have been very capable of taking care of themselves. Mrs. Biggert. Again to Mr. Koskinen, what was the biggest surprise of the rollover? Mr. Koskinen. Well, if you look back at our quarterly assessments, we did four of those. In the last one we put out in the fall, basically in the United States the rollover went as we predicted. We said there were going to be no national infrastructure failures, there would be no regional failures, if there were any failures, there would be isolated problems at the local level. That is what we basically have seen. So in the United States we have been pleased that there haven't been more visible problems for small businesses. A number of them have had glitches, but they seem to have been able to deal with those, because that was an area we were concerned about. So, like others, I think the bigger area of uncertainty for us was what was going to happen abroad. Again, we did not think as we noted in our report and in a report by the Department of Commerce that any glitches abroad would have any significant or noticeable impact on the American economy. We looked at the range of possibilities, where the countries were that were at risk, and where our trade and business partners were, and it was clear to us, no matter what happened in the countries we thought were at risk, it was not going to have an economic impact on us. That also turned out to be true. But as we discussed earlier, I think all of us were, primarily for a lack of information, concerned about a number of countries that rely on some information technology who started late, where it was hard to know exactly how much work they had gotten done in the last to months of . It turned out that in their basic infrastructure, I think primarily because it was not as much at risk as we might have suspected, there haven't been any infrastructure failures. The other thing to bear in mind is in the areas where I think they were at greatest risk, which is in financial transactions and communications, those systems were being tested and worked on for the last years on an international basis. So even in a country that didn't have an organized process for infrastructure protection, its banking system had to be testing and working with other banking systems, because the central bankers around the world for the last years focused on that. That was, in many ways I think, the biggest risk they had and the biggest success they had. Mrs. Biggert. I guess just one last question, that so many valuable lessons came out of the experience, and how are we going to ensure that these lessons aren't lost if we don't continue on after leap year day, February th, I guess it is? Mr. Koskinen. We created in my prior incarnation, with the help of this committee and others, the Clinger-Cohen Act and the Chief Information Officers Council and CIOs in all of the agencies, with the idea they would be as they have been the focus for information technology issues across the government. That council is chaired by my successor as the Deputy Director for Management at OMB, and independent of the information technology issues, the security issues that are under the critical infrastructure assurance organization, but focused on by the CIOs as well, there is an existing vehicle that I think, over the last years of its existence, has turned out to be very effective for bringing together all of the Federal agencies and their senior information technology people to work together on isolating and identifying what are the critical challenges the Federal Government faces, how should we be organized to deal with those, and then implementing those situation suggestions. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. Let me ask you, Mr. Koskinen, you have had a lot of experience in the executive branch, first in OMB and other consultant operations, and, of course, this. You note in your formal statement here, and you mentioned it also, I believe, in your oral summary, this is the greatest management challenge the world has faced in the last years. I think there is probably a lot of truth to that on the world. But when we look at major management challenges within the executive branch over to years, we see the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb, major challenges of how you put that together; going to the moon is certainly another one, setting a goal as President Kennedy there; Admiral Rickover and the nuclear Navy, where you cut through a lot of bureaucracy and got the job done. I guess I would ask you, as you look here, how do Presidents best get served in dealing with those management problems and the one you just presided over? So give us a little insight into that. Mr. Koskinen. Well, as I say, I think the difference between the Y K problem and the other significant challenges you floated, which I think were important for the country is, this was a challenge that affected every system in the Federal Government, every agency. So it was not a question of having NASA or the Energy Department or someone else focusing on a very major challenge. This was a challenge of having every Federal agency, large and small, challenged at the same time, not only within each agency but across agency lines. The Treasury Department services and provides financial services to a wide range of Federal agencies, for example. I think in all of those cases, what is needed is for people to identify the problem and for it to have a high level of commitment and attention from the Congress as well as from the executive branch. Again, I think the structure set up of the CIO council for information technology challenges going forward is an effective structural vehicle for the government to be able to surface what the issues are and deal with them effectively. So as we move forward, I think information technology is not a series of episodic challenges for us. Information technology is an ongoing issue, not just for the Federal Government, but for the private sector and world as we become more reliant on information technology for everything from communication to financial transactions. Mr. Horn. What do you see based on usual experience as to the one or two management challenges after this is done? What do you see? You have had a real eye-opener, I think, throughout the last few years. Mr. Koskinen. Clearly information technology is a challenge. I think it has affected our ability to modernize systems across the government, to have them implemented and operate effectively, has been for some time and will continue to be a challenge. I think performance measurement. I was a great supporter of the Government Performance and Results Act. I think it is important, not only for effective management within the government, but for an improved dialog with the public about what our goals are and our objectives are and how we are doing and achieving those. So as we go forward, I think we have on our plate significant challenges, and we probably don't have to reach out and find new ones. If we could handle both of those effectively, deliver services more effectively under GPRA and provide improved updated modernized information technology delivery systems across the government, I think we are headed in the right direction in those areas, but I think they are major challenges. Mr. Horn. We are going to be holding hearings with the Government Management Subcommittee on Clinger-Cohen that was mentioned, which came out of this subcommittee and the full committee, and also on the computer security issue, which came up here, so we will be looking for you to testify on those things. Those certainly cut across different agencies within the executive branch. We have a whole other agenda also we can get into with whoever is in place there with the CIOs, because I think that is very important, what you did when you took the job and came out of retirement. You went around and sat down with the Deputy Secretaries who often operate the departments, and I think that was very important. Would you like anything else to have done that you didn't have time to do? Mr. Koskinen. No. Oddly enough, this was my feeling even before we had the successful transition, if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't do anything differently. We did all we needed to do, I think, and all we could do. I got tremendous cooperation from not only the leadership in all of the Federal agencies, but as I noted, I think a stunning achievement by career public servants in the Federal Government and State and local government, demonstrating an ability to meet a real challenge and meet it effectively. Mr. Horn. What are you going to do with that $ million headquarters? Who moves in? Mr. Koskinen. That includes the operational cost for a year, so not all of it will be in place. But OMB is working with the agencies and I have said that when we do our last briefing on March st for the rollover, OMB at that time will announce exactly what its plans are for the operational capacity at the information coordination center. Mr. Horn. Most Presidents early in the morning get a national security briefing coming over from CIA. Do any Presidents ever get a management briefing in the morning as to what is going on in the executive branch and why not? Mr. Koskinen. That is not in my jurisdiction at this point, so I can't tell you whether that is done or not. Mr. Horn. It was in part when you were Deputy Director for management. The question is most Presidents don't know what is going on in the executive branch unless there is some crisis that hits the papers. Shouldn't Presidents also be looking at the domestic situation, just as they look in the morning at the foreign situation? Mr. Koskinen. There is no doubt that our ability to manage the vast organizations we have and the significant funds that we have is an important part of our responsibility to the public, and I think that not just in the executive branch and the Congress as well, it is oftentimes more exciting to talk about new policies or new programs or failures isolated. It is much harder, as you know, in the leadership you have had in your subcommittee, to get people to understand and focus on day-in and day-out management. But when push comes to shove, our ability to make changes and provide benefits to people depends on our ability to manage programs effectively. Good ideas poorly implemented are actually very ineffective. Mr. Horn. I am going to yield now to Mr. Wu from Oregon for minutes of questioning. Mr. Wu. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am just going to use a little bit of my time and really focus on this a little bit more with the private sector panel coming up. I just want to ask one question: With the upgrades, the new equipment, the other preparation work which was done in the Federal agencies, do you see, or are you currently experiencing a dip in procurement as a result of the bulge, if you will, prior to December st? Mr. Koskinen. I think the agencies can probably answer that question better. Mr. Burbano. I would like to address that as the CIO for the State Department. I would say not really, for this reason. There was a lot of systems, and I know at the State Department we put a moratorium on systems development and implementation and so forth if it wasn't Y K-related. So all of that was put on the shelf, and now it is getting off-the-shelf as soon as the leap year is over. So that is going to offset. Mr. Rossotti. With respect to the IRS what really happened is that over a to -year period, we made an investment to bring up-to-date our hardware and operating system software. But, for example, with PCs, personal computers, we really need to be on about a -year replacement cycle there, so we are replacing each year about one-third of the computers representing what was installed years ago. That is kind of the way that we are planning it. There will be some dropoff in a few areas where we had to make some special investments, but, on the whole, what we really want to do is get on a long-range planning basis where we invest a certain amount every year so that we don't get behind as badly as we were years ago. Mr. Wu. And with respect to personnel, the people you brought aboard, whether on a long-term basis or on a contract basis to help you with the Y K problem, are they being redeployed within your agencies, have they left? What is going on with the people? Mr. Rossotti. Speaking for myself and the IRS, what we have done is we simply made a determined effort years ago to retain the people we had. Unfortunately, we were suffering attrition. So we made some very successful efforts to retain the people we had, the people who really know some of these old software systems, and simply had to put many, many other things on hold. We even had to go to the Congress when they passed the Restructuring Reform Act, and ask that some of the effective dates for the law be extended out to , because there was no way to implement some of the things while still working on the fixes. So what we did was we simply took our staff, tried to retain it, and allocated it to fixing Y K as the top priority, putting other things on hold. What we are now doing is trying to dig out from this huge backlog. Furthermore, we are in an unusual position in that we are now just embarking on an enormous technology modernization program. What IRS has right now is we have relatively new hardware in most cases, and relatively up-to-date operating systems, such as your Windows-type operating systems and your mainframe operating systems. What we don't have is up-to-date application software. We have, in fact, extremely obsolete applications software, and we have a lot of it. So our role now over the next several years is with the help of a prime contractor is to reengineer that technology, and as I mentioned in my opening statement, that involves business change as well as technology change. So you could almost think of Y K as just laying the groundwork for what we really have to do over the next several years to reengineer our applications. Mr. Burbano. From my view at the State Department, with the new Y K initiative, if you want to call it the critical infrastructure protection I have been talking about, there is going to be a huge demand for new people with possibly different skills for computer security, cyber terrorism and so forth. So there will be a replacement. Some of the skills used in Y K can certainly be applied. Others, maybe not. So you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. Regardless, there is going to be a huge demand for this new initiative that is facing us that is very serious. Mr. Wu. On net, do you think you are adding folks in the hardware-software information systems area, or are you shedding a few now in the State Department? Mr. Burbano. I think it is a combination. Not with employees, with contractors. It is a combination of shifting, replacement of skills, keeping some. But don't forget, we are still not out of the Y K window until the rollover of the leap year. So that is a little bit too early to say right now. But we are starting to look at it in that view, that since we do have this new huge initiative that is very important and will go on for the unforeseeable future, there will be a replacement of skills, and some of those will be applicable and some not. Mr. Wu. I thank the witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Horn. The gentleman from Washington, Mr. Baird, minutes. Mr. Baird. No questions. Mr. Horn. Mrs. Biggert, the gentlewoman from Illinois. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you. In making the fixes on the computers, organizations really used a lot of different methods, and some, apparently, I think what we heard before were like short-term fixes as far as the date change of windowing, making the dates like and rather than or . Will there be any oversight or will organizations, do you think, pursue a permanent change, or will these temporary changes or fixes really last for the long time, or will there have to be something done there? Is there any oversight, I guess, is the question or do they need to--do you know of organizations that will need to pursue the permanent fix? Maybe Mr. Willemssen. And one other thing, I think, like HCFA delayed putting in a new system until this was over. Do you see that the Y K will have benefited how for them to pursue that, the new changes in their systems? Mr. Willemssen. First of all, you are correct, many organizations had to use techniques such as windowing, because in many instances they had no choice. There wasn't enough time to go through a full date expansion of the software and data bases. So many of them did use those kind of techniques. They will not last forever. Many of those same organizations plan to have new systems over the next few years, so that the risk, if those new systems come in, is relatively small. However, the caveat to that is when programmers put in digits in the 's and 's, they thought their systems also would be replaced, and many of them were not. So there still has to be some oversight of that issue. I would say it is very difficult, though, to generalize among agencies because even within a specific agency business function, some may have windowed, some may have gotten a new system, while others may have fully expanded the date field. It is therefore, an issue where you have to go in and do a full examination and know what you are dealing with and be aware of where your risk points are as time continues with these kind of patched systems. Mr. Burbano. I would like to say that at the State Department, since the Y K program office was run underneath the CIO, which is remaining, we do track where we used windowing. We used a combination of windowing repairs as well as replacements. We do have a list of those. We are tracking them, and most of those are years or more out. But we do have a list of those and we will track them so long as the CIO office lasts. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Thank you. Now the cochairman of this task force, Mrs. Morella, the gentlewoman from Maryland. Mrs. Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A question for Mr. Willemssen. GAO recently reported that some of the Y K remediation that was done at Federal agencies was contracted out to private corporations, and in your report, you noted that some of the private companies used non-U.S. citizens to work out the remediation. I just wondered if you would comment for the record on what you found and what you think implications are, if any? Mr. Willemssen. We did have a request from the full House Science Committee to look at the use of foreign nationals at the Federal Aviation Administration in both the remediation of software and in the post-remediation review of software that had been previously remediated, and we did find some oversights on the part of FAA. To the FAA administrator's credit, she aggressively took action on these oversights, and they are now in the process of going out and making sure that all of the individuals who worked on the code are indeed checked out. FAA did not know for sure, for all of the systems that were remediated and reviewed, that the individuals had an appropriate background investigation, and therefore whether the risk was manageable in terms of manipulating the code. So there were some issues that we did find. Again, to FAA's credit, they have been very aggressive in following up on these issues. One of the issues I think you pointed out at one of the prior hearings, was that there was a security risk involved to the extent that it wasn't managed with all of this push to get Y K done. That it would be done quickly, losing sight of some of the necessary controls, and that is in fact, what happened here at FAA. All the controls were not in place to check out all of the individuals working on the code. Mrs. Morella. Do you feel comfortable that this has then become a symbol for what could happen if you don't have proper implementation of the regulations and that the agencies all know this? Did we learn from it, besides the FAA immediately saying we will correct the oversight? Mr. Willemssen. I hesitate to generalize because FAA is the only agency where we went into depth on this particular point, so I hesitate to say that other agencies may have similar issues, although I know the executive branch is looking into that. I know that, as I mentioned, FAA has been very aggressive and actually we are expecting a more detailed report from FAA within the next couple of days on all of their actions in response to a recommendation to do the background checks on individuals working on the code. Mrs. Morella. I think you would like to comment on that. Mr. Burbano. Yes. The State Department, we looked at this issue very carefully at the beginning. First of all, domestically, we did not use any foreigners, especially that is where mission critical systems are. We do require, regardless, we do require all of our contractors and employees to go through secret clearances. In addition to that, some minor systems overseas did have some FSNs, foreign service nationals, working on their systems, but they were closely supervised by the Americans at the Embassies, and we have had no problem at all. Everybody goes through a clearance check anyway. Mrs. Morella. Splendid. Thanks for that assurance. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. Let me ask a few questions here in closing with this panel. I would like the commissioner and Mr. Koskinen to respond to this. The question would be the extent to which windowing was used to repair systems, and is that really a permanent situation, or how do you feel about the windowing aspect where you are trying to piece it altogether and fool it, shall we say, in terms of the computers? Mr. Koskinen. I don't think anybody has the capacity to tell you how much of the work was done by windowing and how much was date expansion. Windowing is a technique that is effective as long as you don't care about when people were born or transactions in those windows. In other words, if you really are only worried about relative dates, you can window. But in things like Social Security, you can't window very effectively, because you care very much about whether or not somebody has been born on one side of the window or another. Second, I think the point Mr. Willemssen made is important, and that is, when we talk about configuration management and better control of IT systems, obviously monitoring the way we fix systems for Y K as we go forward is an important part of that management, and I think it is exactly right to note that years ago, years ago, people working on systems that knew they weren't going to be Y K compliant were comfortable because they thought those systems wouldn't be operating. So you have to be a little worried about anybody saying today, well, my windowing works until or , so I don't have a problem, because those dates will come before we know it. So I think the answer to that is not was it done, it clearly was done. It was a very effective technique, it was cost effective, and particularly if you are going to replace or upgrade those systems, it was probably the right way to go. It will turn out to be a mistake if you lose track of it, continue to run the systems through the window, and discover you have got a major challenge down the road. Mr. Rossotti. I am pleased to say in this case, one of the few occasions I can answer very easily, we did not use windowing at the IRS, we did everything with -date digit expansion and required a special exception from the CIO to have any exceptions, and, to my knowledge there were just maybe a very tiny handful, maybe one system given an exception. Interestingly, the reason for that decision was not primarily because of worries that would, you know, become obsolete in or years, but because we had so many heterogeneous systems that had to work together, we were not convinced that if we used some windowing here and some data expansion here, that we wouldn't run into incompatibilities among our own systems. So we made a decision to keep it simple, and so everything was made compliant by four-digit date expansion. Mr. Horn. OK. Now it has been mentioned on the foreign workers in some of the patching up of these systems, I would be curious how you all think how vulnerable our computer systems are as a result of the Y K, and are you concerned that those remediating systems could have engaged in acts contrary to the best interests of the government? So I would just appreciate-- let's start with Mr. Burbano. Mr. Burbano. Yes. In terms of the concern, you should always be concerned, but because of the process I mentioned that we took at State with requiring security clearances, all domestic systems, where our mission critical/critical systems are at, only used Americans. We don't have as much concern there. Overseas, again, I mentioned we did use FSNs who have to be cleared and who only work the minor systems and who are closely monitored by Americans when working on the systems. So we are not as concerned. However, we did develop a project in concert with my sister bureau, Diplomatic Security, on doing some spot checks on some of the systems, just to make sure. But, just to let you know, you know, even with commercially off-the-shelf systems, you don't know where those systems are developed. They could have foreigners working on those systems also. So you do have to be vigilant about these systems. Mr. Horn. Commissioner, in terms of computer security, I am sure you have to deal with that every day in some way. Mr. Rossotti. Well, we have, of course, major security challenges in the IRS from a number of perspectives, including from the old applications software. But I think on this particular issue, that is to say, the contractor support we used for the Y K, I think we were in pretty good shape on that. There was one particular component of one system that, for a particular reason, was developed with some offshore people, but that was then subsequently cross-checked by a different group that was cleared. So as far as I know, I think we can be pretty confident on this, we do not have much vulnerability for this particular problem. That is not the same thing as saying we don't have vulnerabilities for other reasons. Mr. Horn. Mr. Koskinen, why don't you give us your side of it? Mr. Koskinen. I think Mr. Burbano made the important point, which is, security is an issue beyond Y K, you ought to be very careful about whoever works on your systems. As a general matter, we were concerned about this issue from the start and we worked with the intelligence agencies and the National Security Council and others, both to warn private sector companies as well as domestic companies to be alert to this issue. Most of them in a large sense are. Most of the off-shore work was done by the private sector and not the government. Most government work was done by normal contracting, or internal resources, so that there was much less of that done here than in the private sector. Monitoring what has gone on in the private sector, what has gone on, we have seen very little, in fact, almost no evidence that work done offshore included some kind of security threat. Obviously, the absence of glitches over the rollover means at least if somebody was targeting the time to create mischief, that was not one of those times. But I think the bottom line to that is, again, as we move forward, information security has to be high on everybody's list. I think, again, the point is well made. It is not just people who have access to your system. It is when you buy systems, whether it is off-the-shelf systems or otherwise, you have to be worried about who worked on those systems, what is in them and what potential impact could they have on your own system. So I think if anything requires eternal vigilance, it will be, in fact, information security and security about those working on your systems. Mr. Horn. I thank you. We will be holding a separate hearing on the computer security anyhow, so we will postpone the rest of those questions. Mr. Willemssen, before we round out this panel, I would like you to summarize the following under of your formal statement, ``Reported Year -related Errors in the Federal Government.'' If you could just sort of bullet them to me in one sentence, each one, just so we have it in the record, I would appreciate it. Mr. Willemssen. On is a summary of what we observed during the rollover from both the perspective of the information coordination center and specific agencies where we were onsite. We tried to summarize what we thought seemed to be significant issues that did come up, even though they were addressed very quickly. Briefly, those included the Department of Defense intelligence satellite system, the Federal Aviation Administration had some systems with some Y K failures that again, they were able to remediate and fix very quickly, and the Health Care Financing Administration ran into some difficulties with partners. In one case HCFA had a problem with a bank on some electronic payments leading to some delays in payments, although it is still within the required targets. Also, HCFA will continue to work aggressively with their providers in making sure that they put forward accurate dates on their claims so that claims are not returned. Mr. Horn. You say here there are , claims from providers with these erroneous dates in the first week of the new year. Mr. Willemssen. That is why we thought it important to give a sense of the magnitude, because they are not just little things that we are talking about. They are little within the scope of the entire Medicare program, but they do have some impact. But, again, HCFA has done an outstanding job over the last couple of years on getting on top of Y K. They as much as anyone faced a mission impossible on Y K, and through the leadership of their administrator, again, they continue to be very aggressive in following up and making sure that the disruptions are kept to a minimum. Mr. Horn. And then the ones that concern most of us based on our air travel regularly is the low level wind shear alert system. Can you tell us anything about that? Mr. Willemssen. Again, those systems were out at about eight locations, but they were out for no more than hours, I think hours minutes at the outside. Fortunately, when they were out, we saw no evidence of bad weather in those locations. So we could be sure, based on the evidence we saw that there were no safety implications from those systems being out. Again, it speaks toward the advantage of all the agencies being poised to respond during the rollover. FAA was ready to get right on top of those systems and fix them immediately, and that they did, to their credit. Mr. Horn. Yes. I was spending part of that December st in the L.A. Tower, and I got a good education from the technicians there. They have a terrific job to do when they are getting those radar sites into operation when something goes crazy with them. I was very impressed by that group. So are there any other major things that is a worry to the General Accounting Office? Mr. Willemssen. I again conclude by saying the rollover was a great success, thanks to the leadership of Mr. Koskinen and yours and Chairwoman Morella's leadership. However, I think it is important that we continue to monitor events over the next couple of months. I would strongly concur with Mr. Koskinen's plan to bring up the ICC again during the leap year, because I think there will be a few disruptions that again occur, and I think there will also be a few disruptions that we start hearing about as processing cycles complete themselves. So we haven't heard the last of Y K. But I think it will be much, much less than what we had once feared. Mr. Horn. I want to end on a happy note here and help the Department of State a little, Mr. Burbano. In November , the Department of State submitted its regular quarterly report for the year to the Office of Management and Budget, and of course, that does come to our subcommittee. After a lot of discussion with you and OMB, it became clear that the language in that quarterly report didn't really accurately reflect the actual level of effort for the Department's independent verification and validation work. Just so we can give you an A on this, please explain to me the independent verification process that you actually went through but wasn't in the report. Mr. Burbano. Thank you very much. At the State Department, one of the things that I did when I came on board in May , as you all know, I came on board, we had straight F's for about a year, so I had to move quickly in order to especially meet the deadlines of Congress. But I wanted to make sure that we did it correctly and not get any surprises at the rollovers. So I set up a very rigorous process where not only did we have the separate bureaus test our systems, but underneath my office, the Y K office separate from their individual bureau Y K offices, I had independent contractors test the systems. That was the first level of independent tests. But in addition to that, I did a partnership with the Inspector General where they would do a second test with their own contractors to review the test and so forth, and certify the systems, along with myself as the CIO. So we went through two levels of independent verification tests, in addition to the testing that the Bureau did themselves. The misunderstanding that came in that, we were about percent in November or somewhere around that nature, in terms of certification, but when, in fact, it really equalled to about percent, because we had already finished our first level. That is where the misunderstanding came. I think we proved that right since we had really no significant--not only in the mission criticals, but in the criticals as well as the routines, this thoroughness that we did. Mr. Horn. Well, thank you very much. On that, are there any questions any Member has? If not, we appreciate what each of you has had to contribute to this and the fine work you have done that kept us going with very minor glitches. So thank you all for coming. We now go to panel two. Mr. Horn. I would ask you to stand and raise your right hands. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Horn. The reporter will note all three confirmed. Mrs. Morella will preside. Mrs. Morella [presiding]. Thank you. I want to thank the second panel for being so patient and waiting in going through the first panel testimony and the questions that were asked. So we will be concise. We know that you can offer a great deal to supplement what we learned about Y K. Proceeding again with the -minute rule, you can give us a synopsis of your testimony. We will start with, first of all, Mr. Harris Miller. I want to comment on the fact that from the very beginning Mr. Miller has been very tuned into this issue, has appeared before this committee probably as many times as any other person who has testified. So we very much appreciate his coming back now at the end as we do our summation and look ahead to the future. He is president of the Information Technology Association of America. Ms. Kathy Hotka has not appeared before this committee before, so you are the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. Ms. Hotka is vice president for technology at the National Retail Federation here in Washington, DC. We welcome you. Thank you. Mr. Gary Beach has appeared before this joint committee, and he is the publisher of CIO Communications, Inc., from Framingham, MA. Again, thank you for appearing here. Thank you for waiting. Let's start off with Mr. Miller. STATEMENTS OF HARRIS MILLER, PRESIDENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA; CATHY HOTKA, VICE PRESIDENT FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION; AND GARY BEACH, PUBLISHER, CIO COMMUNICATIONS, INC. Mr. Miller. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. It is said that politics makes strange bedfellows, but I found out that Y K makes strange bedfellows, for on the morning of January st, instead of being snuggled warm in my bed with my wife, I was instead with Chairman Horn at the C-SPAN studios doing a broadcast on Y K. What is even more unusual is that at a.m., constituents of his from California were calling in, which means at o'clock in the morning they were paying attention to what was going on with Y K. But I appreciated working with both of you chairmen and the members of your subcommittee. I am going to skip the victory lap you mentioned, Madam Chairwoman. It is my written statement and will be in record. I obviously want to commend the subcommittees, and particularly Mr. Koskinen, for his leadership. From the perspective of the private sector, we do believe this is a real crisis that we did face, it was not something that was hyped or made up. In fact, as I was walking down the hall this morning with our Y K program manager, Heidi Hooper is with me, she noted there wasn't a line about the hallway waiting to get into the subcommittee hearing. I said that is good news, because if, in fact, the problems had occurred, I suggest you wouldn't have Harris Miller and Kathy Hotka and Gary Beach on this panel, you would have Alan Greenspan and Secretary Summers discussing the global recession that had been caused. So, in fact, the fact we didn't have a major crisis is good news, and the fact we don't have hordes of people standing around is, in fact, very good news. In terms of the magnitude of the effort, I would certainly agree with Mr. Koskinen's effort. In fact, I even go a little more hyperbolic, I think it is the biggest success since the building of the pyramids, because it was, in fact, a global effort, government, private sector, hundreds of thousands of individuals around the globe working together to achieve this success. To talk about the lessons learned, I would like to refer to what I believe is a Y K renaissance. What do I mean by a Y K renaissance? I think it really is two parts. First of all, the rationalization of the existing computer technology. You heard a lot about this from the first panel in the Federal sector, but the same thing was true very much in the private sector. The fact that time and again, because of the necessity of dealing with this huge challenge, companies were able to get rid of deadwood programs, they were able to bring into their companies more modern and more efficient computer systems. They also learned to do supply chain analysis and in a systematic way that they had never done before. They were able to collaborate in ways never experienced before, either within companies or across companies. They were able to develop contingency plans, many of which were not needed as it turned out, at least are now in place should there be future problems, and they learned to approach the entire IT system in a much more strategic way. That is going to mean that down the road these companies and ultimately their customers can take much more benefit from information technology. The productive gains which Mr. Greenspan and others have noted have helped to contribute to the continued growth of our economy and the high productivity should be even stronger because the IT systems in companies as well as within the government are now being treated much more rationally and in a much more systematic way. The second reason I call this a Y K renaissance is the new directions that companies are now taking. Because as they came to understand through Y K the strategic as opposed to tactical importance of IT, they are now moving ahead implementing future IT much more strategically. Obviously, the Internet changes everything, and we are seeing throughout the private sector and we hope the government sector will quickly catch up the use of the Internet for improved, dramatically improved in many cases, internal processes, whether you are talking about personnel systems, whether you are talking about human resources or financial services, whether you are talking about inventory control, all of these basic day-to-day business operations are being done much more effectively and efficiently on the Internet. This is one of the new exciting aspects of Internet technology. Also, of course, dealing with customers, and customers don't just mean business to consumer, the kind of stuff you read about on the front page, about Amazon.Com and others. It also means business to business, because businesses are also customers, and the ability of businesses to deal much more effectively. So this is the kind of Y K renaissance I see coming, because as we come out of what Mr. Burbano and others described in the Federal sector, which also occurred in the private sector, namely, a temporary freeze in many cases on new programs and spending, and now all these projects which have been temporarily set aside are going to be brought out to the fore, and again, I think you are going to see massive increases in productivity, in major benefits to customers, and again, customers I define broadly as businesses and individual consumers. Let me talk about some other lessons learned. One of the lessons learned that was that while the government sector did an excellent job, as the previous panel discussed, the private sector also did a remarkable job. Some names of individuals who you may not have come across, or maybe you have come across, like Bill Mont and Tim Shepherd Whalen from Global , or Ron Balls from the ITU, people who are able to take entire sectors and coordinate them, you are going to hear from Ms. Hotka about the retail sector, contributed mightily to the success. I think ongoing we have learned lessons about the ability of these sectors to work both nationally and globally. I also use that as a point for future global cooperation. The International Y K Coordination Center, which both of you were very involved with and which Mr. Bruce McConnell headed so ably, has demonstrated the opportunity for global cooperation. Coming out of that, I am hopeful we will see some continued opportunities. For example, the International Y K Coordinating Center steering committee is considering the creation of what is called the Center for Digital Opportunity, which would be a cooperative program to promote Internet growth in developing countries to the same extent that it currently is in developed countries. In fact, tomorrow the steering committee will have a conference call and I am involved in that also, as is Mr. Koskinen, to see about the possibility of building on the linkages that have been established through Y K in that area. Similarly, the issue that Mr. Burbano talked about so extensively and Chairman Horn said you will be having further hearings on, the whole issue of information security. While there are information security issues which are very specific to the U.S. Government, there are many issues which are global in nature. Again, the -plus countries that work together through the international Y K cooperation center should be able to take those linkages which they established and build on them for information security. I think that is also another lesson learned. The last lesson learned which I would like to refer to, and I am a little bit over my time, is that the Y K problem was solved without government dictating what the private sector needed to do, without legislation. As you remember, you two chair people, at a hearing early on, there was actually discussion about perhaps Congress having to mandate the private sector to take specific actions. You came to the correct conclusion that, in fact, there were better ways to do that, rather than mandating specific activity. We did get through this without mandating specific activity on the part of the Congress to order the private sector to do activities because the private sector was and to work collaboratively. I think the lesson learned there is as we move ahead to other challenges in information technology, whether it be the information security area or regulation of the Internet, that the claims that the private sector made to you then that we can handle this in a collaborative manner, not working against government, but cooperatively with government, did prove true in the Y K area, and I think when Congress approaches other issues, such as information security or other issues of regulating the Internet, they should take that lesson learned, and perhaps it will also prove true that you do not need legislation, that there are other ways to get things done in this new economy and in this information revolution. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to appear before you, and I would be glad to answer any questions. Mrs. Morella. Thank you. I also want to comment on the fact that I did hear that early morning C-SPAN program, and it was very informative. Thanks for your leadership. [The prepared statement of Mr. Miller follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mrs. Morella. I am now pleased to recognize Ms. Hotka. Ms. Hotka. Chairman Morella, Chairman Horn, members of the committee, retailers appreciate your leadership on this issue, and I appreciate the opportunity to appear here with you today. As you may know, the National Retail Federation's Survival project worked for years to coordinate a joint retail- industry response to the year issue. We worked with department stores, restaurants, specialty stores, liquor stores, pharmacists, convenience stores and grocery stores to make sure that you could shop this year. People are really shopping as a result. How did retailers fare? Better than we expected. But the sector desk at the White House information coordination center that seemed to have the most to talk about was ours, retail and small business. As expected, bigger businesses experienced annoyance grade glitches and some smaller ones found out that that fix on failure policy they had was not such a great idea. Anecdotally, we know of retailers still processing credit cards manually because of the IC verify problem. One retailer's store credit cards failed. Cash registers at one chocolate store chain would not open. But the examples here are relatively minor. Now, it remains to be seen whether the global supply chain would be unaffected, larger retailers have some doubt about whether or not we have sailed through this internationally. Was it worth the work and expense? We already know the answer. While retailers spent multiple billions of dollars to find and fix and replace software and hardware and to conduct extensive testing, we also would not do it any differently. We had conducted a survey in that showed that if retailers didn't undertake this work, many key systems would simply be dead in the water. We found out that percent, all, private label credit card systems would not have worked; percent of warehouse management systems would have failed. Most retail processes are touched by technology, and our members were not willing to bet the business they would be fine without remediation. My members are astonished that some columnists have questioned the value of the investment. Mr. Burbano mentioned earlier that some countries found they were less dependent on technology than they thought. We discovered we were more dependent on technology than we had thought. So what lessons did we learn? We learned four: First, we learned that most organizations underestimated their reliance on IT despite healthy investments in technology, retailers found that some business critical processes were being run by business units on -year-old software. You cannot run a company on paradox . for DOS. It is not a good idea. Some companies maintained software they didn't need. Some key programs were being run by people with no IT background. Companies did not have contingency plans. In fact, we found only one company that had a contingency plan at all. In the end, though, savvy companies realized Y K was not an IT issue but a business issue, and that IT needs the continuing attention of the CEO. Those companies that did best had the CEO in charge of this project. We who lead industries must bring a better appreciation of IT as knowledge management, not just PCs and printers. Second, we learned that reliable information was hard to come by on this, particularly in the early days. Should retailers have believed technology companies product updates? They seemed to change hourly. Should retailers have believed government agencies' self- reports? How about suppliers? How about the fear mongers? Ultimately, no self-reported information was reliable, and retailers simply conducted their own verification in the absence of reliable test data or organizational benchmarks, this was our only choice. It was expensive and time-consuming. We know of a number of companies, for instance, that put people on airplanes all during to check on international readiness. These people simply traveled from country to country. Third, we learned that government may have a useful role in helping companies use technology as a business tool. There is no doubt, but that the white hot spotlight of your committee's attention to this issue brought home to all of us the need to work diligently. Your contributions to private industry preparedness should not be underestimated. We paid a lot of attention to those report cards. Our friends at GAO published world-class, best-practices documents that gave private industry some models to work from. John Koskinen and his talented staff helped galvanize countries, governmental bodies, private industry and the media. All were key to helping retailers who rely on a global supply chain and public confidence. We thank you all. Like Harris, we believe that this should be a partnership and not a speaking from on high. But, fourth, we learned that joint action was key. No one retailer did it alone. Fierce competitors worked together to keep the industry ready. Generous companies allowed staff to speak at conferences to spread the word to others. So going forward, we would like to continue what we have been doing for the past several years, working to protect America's business data. Congress should continue to show interest in America's information infrastructure. The White House ICC where public-private partnerships were so useful might continue to be a valuable tool. Business still needs best practices that can help smaller companies use technologies responsibly, and reliable sources of information about threats to data from hackers, viruses and industrial espionage are needed. Let's continue to work together. Public private partnerships got us through Y K, but we have compelling reasons to keep working in and beyond. Thank you. Mrs. Morella. Thank you very much for that testimony. Now we will hear from Mr. Beach. Mr. Beach. Madam Chairwoman, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to appear before the committee again. Madam Chairwoman, talking about the victory lap analogy, I live close to Hopkinton, MA, which is the start of the Boston Marathon, and I would say what we have learned with all the great work here is that we are in the first mile of a marathon, a marathon showing how pervasive technology is in all of our lives. The subject of my testimony here is in the written side, but I will orally summarize it, is lessons learned, opportunities created, and I would encourage the committee to look forward as to what are some of those exciting opportunities. Increasing the crescendo of hyperbole, we heard about John Koskinen talking about it in the last years, and Mr. Miller talking about the work as is comparable to pyramids. I would say that the year computer problem and the work that was done on it by a myriad of groups is the most remarkable peacetime example of human cooperation in the history of the world, and I have an idea for you at the end of my oral testimony. We are entering, what I see, as the age of digital enlightenment where technology is going to help nations govern better, help businesses conduct better business, and make everyone's digital life all the more meaningful. The committee asked the panelists ``was Y K hyped for profit?'' Those of us on the front lines, the ITAA and Kathy and her group and others, have no doubt that without proper remediation and all the great work that this committee has done, Y K would have had a severe impact on computer systems around the world. It is interesting, isn't it, that those companies that may have benefited from an increase in sales of computer hardware or software over the last couple of years are now reporting in the Wall Street Journal over the last couple of days saying their earnings reports are down because of Y K. So what goes around comes around, and it is all going to even out in the end. So, the long-term legacy of this challenge is going to be akin to the oil crisis that we saw in the mid- 's, where we had relatively short-term pain, and long-term we had more fuel- efficient cars. The Y K long-term legacy was simply mentioned here many times today that it caused the world to update its computing infrastructure in a relatively short period of time. I was personally surprised at how well the rest of the world made it through digitally unscathed on January st. I would say this experience was a resounding clarion call to our government and our industries that other nations, many of whom predominantly use U.S. technology, are running neck and neck with the United States. It seems to me that the digital playing field appears to be leveling off. And, in this new st century, where the economy is going to be very digital and electronic, these other countries are prepared to provide stronger global competition. On the earlier panel we talked about foreign nationals. I had an opportunity last year to travel to Bangalore, India, where I saw thousands of workers producing Y K remediation projects, many for United States firms. These workers are now going to be looking to produce products and services in their own global environment. The next big technological breakthrough is going to be e- commerce. A CIO poll recently reported that percent of American businesses now have e-commerce initiatives started. What is even more important to me is by , these e-commerce initiatives are going to be the core business models of these businesses. Shifting to opportunities for government, the Y K revolution has afforded the Federal Government and the State and local governments opportunities to modernize its computing infrastructure. We should leverage these revitalized systems to better do the business of governing. Opportunities before this House and this committee in light of legislation continue on Internet taxation, how Americans will govern using technology, closing the digital divide of the have's and have not's, and possibly the aspect of a not too long-term strategy of having the United States wean off its dependence on foreign workers. I did some work last year in Massachusetts reviewing the State's entire higher education system. While there are more and more men and women entering computer science courses in classes across the country, the challenge is that the faculties at many of these institutions are not prepared to teach the new technologies. As I mentioned in the beginning of my testimony, I had an idea. I would encourage Madam Chairman and Mr. Chairman to send on behalf of the world's IT workers, a letter to the Nobel Prize committee in Oslo recommending that a special award be given in October to the world's IT workers, where possibly a person from the informatics committee at the U.N. could go to accept it, and on a site, some place on a U.N. URL, any worker who worked on Y K could download it and proudly frame it in his or her office. In closing, Y K in context, was a massive tactical challenge, but what it underscored on a more strategic level is the importance of technology in governing and commerce, and with the seemingly stable technology infrastructure in place, now is the time to take advantage of these new opportunities. Thank you. Mrs. Morella. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Beach follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mrs. Morella. I think that is a fitting way to end the testimony of the panelists with this concept of the Nobel Prize and the fact that it is a great example, as you said, a feat greater than or as great as the pyramids. Ms. Hotka had some very glowing things to say about what we learned also. Coming from the private sector, it is particularly important. We have a roll call vote right now, a quorum, but we will be back for some questioning, so I would imagine minutes or so. So we will recess this hearing for about minutes. [Recess.] Mrs. Morella. I am going to reconvene this hearing. I can ask a few questions, and then if other Members come in in the meantime, they can continue to ask questions. Of course, our policy has been that if it is acceptable to you, that we might also submit questions to you by Members who may not be here. Thank you. I appreciate that. You know, I think there have been many, many benefits to the Y K work that has been done, whether or not it is the dimension of the pyramids or Nobel Peace Prize, but certainly there has been a lot of cooperation that has been so comprehendible. In going to the command station on December st, I saw many people from the private sector on their own time, unpaid, who were there for hours and spent their New Years' Eve there, and then part of New Years' morning there also. I also saw a report that National Institutes of Standards and Technology did a lot of work with small businesses in remediation of the Y K computer bug, and the small businesses have said they thought this was a concept that they hoped would continue, the idea of being able to get help and get assistance from somebody, an agency or whatever, that cared about them. So, again, it is another example of the private sector benefiting from what the public sector had done. Then just the other day at the District of Columbia hearing, both Chairman Horn and I are on that authorizing committee, I asked Mayor Williams about it, because, as you may remember, the District of Columbia was so far behind, and he was very excited about the results, the fact that they have now been able to update their computer system, they know what they have, and because technology will play such a big role, particularly as we try to revitalize the District of Columbia, that they feel they are going to benefit greatly by it. Also by working with neighboring communities too. So, again, the whole concept you all pointed out, and that is, building on the various linkages and the partnerships. Well, I am going to ask you a question that deals with people. The vast Y K repair corps is now being scattered to the winds after apparently saving the world from the Y K disaster. So now what are these people trained to correct Y K, probably those people who knew could balance, what do they do now? Can these displaced Y K workers help to alleviate the H B situation? What do you see with regard to the whole personnel issue? I will start with any one of you. Ms. Hotka, why don't we start with you first. Ms. Hotka. Just briefly, one of the things that struck us about the people that worked on this was their ability to deal with business units. IT does not live in a vacuum, and this was never an IT problem. These people went out and spent time in warehouse facilities with people who run the trucks, with suppliers, with the accounting offices and all through the business. What we are seeing in our industry is that those people will continue to work in these companies and that they will continue to work with these business units to make sure that the IT tools that are created are actually used and are used effectively. That is a skill. These are generally older people, people over , and they have got---- Mr. Miller. Speak for yourself. Ms. Hotka. Well, I am saying that because there is a tremendous emphasis, I think, in some parts of the IT world on people who are very young, who have experience in new technologies. But some of us who are not that young have some experience that might be useful, and we are finding that it is being priced in these retail companies. They don't want to lose these people. Mr. Miller. I think, Madam Chairman, what Mr. Burbano discussed is, in the Federal Government, very similarly true in the private sector. If you take the first group of people, namely, people who are interimly the staff of an organization, in most cases when the Y K issue became a priority for the organization internally, and the organization decided to use internal resources, they simply took other projects, put them off to the side and took those people and focused on Y K; and now that they have gotten through most of the Y K era, leaving aside having to get through the next months to February th, those projects, which have been temporarily frozen, are now going to come back as high priorities, and those people are going to go back and do those projects. That is one group to think about. The second group of people are the contractors who came in from outside to do work for customers, whether those customers were in government or the private sector. A lot of those companies, which provided those outside services, were in a situation where they anticipated very well the end of the Y K, they knew when their projects were going to end, and so they had to do two things: No. , they had to find new clients so they can continue to stay in business and continue to grow their businesses; and No. , they had to take into account the need to upgrade the skills of their employees to do more current projects, most of which are going to be e-commerce related or somehow on the Internet revolution as opposed to the mainframe projects. If you look at the major companies that do business and look at the revenue in versus , you will see their revenue continue to go up even as the Y K work began to drop off. The reason is that because they were able to find new customers and they were able to retrain the work force. So not only do I think this is not going to solve the H B problem, if you use the logic that I use in my testimony that this is going to be a Y K renaissance, and a lot of projects were temporarily frozen while companies were getting through the Y K problem, I think there is going to be even a bigger explosion and even more demand for IT workers. The trick is going to be, as you suggested in your question and as Ms. Hotka commented in her comments, making sure the workers do have the retraining. The computer language skills they have are not the ones most current or most in demand, and that has to be factored into the process. Mrs. Morella. I do think many of them are older, but, on the other hand, I know the University of Maryland had a special course geared toward remediation of Y K. Mr. Beach. Mr. Beach. Madam Chairman, I just would like to once again mention the aspect of what human beings like most is recognition, I am dead serious in challenging you and Chairman Horn to nominate these workers for noble awards. The international Y K cooperation center that we heard about today, and you are familiar with, and that Bruce McConnell did an incredibly good job running, had a subset called YES Corps, which was the Y K Experts Service Corps. I was fortunate to be on that steering committee. This group aimed to share information with countries about Y K, and currently it is migrating to another role. We all felt this network was created for tactically addressing Y K, the network was more valuable than the actual focus on Y K. So there is movement afoot to expound this effort. I would like to say there is a vested interest in large businesses in whatever they can do here in the States to help small businesses, because we are all living in this giant economic supply chain. Many large businesses are even more dependent now on smaller businesses. The H B visa issue, I know there is a call now to bring the limit up to , . Long-term what we have to do, and I addressed it briefly in my testimony, is more rather than fewer students in America are entering computer science courses, whether in California, Maryland or Massachusetts. I chaired last summer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a review of the entire higher education program, and the most damning finding we found was that we were talking about older people here, but the faculty, the faculty, No. , is older, is not skilled in the new technologies of JAVA, XML, you name it. There is a bottleneck there. If that bottleneck is not relieved or addressed, then our country is going to continue to have to rely on H B visa issues. Mr. Miller. Could I make one more point on personnel to follow on the earlier discussion of information security? That is an enormous problem, because we do not have information security specialists trained. That is one area where you can't do H Bs, you can't send the work offshore to Ireland or Israel or India. That work has to be done with U.S. citizens. I know President Clinton mentioned this in his national plan, and Attorney General Reno talked about it. So this is one area where the government, working with academia and business, is going to have to focus. You are going to have to convince people to go beyond their traditional education, to get additional education, plus get security clearances, because obviously, the type of people that a Federal agency or a State government wants to hire for security information, security purposes is going to need a clearance. Even you are going to find in the private sector many private-sector financial institutions and others want to get people with very high security clearances because they are being put in very sensitive security positions. Mrs. Morella. As a matter of fact, the Science Committee passed, in the first session, actually the last Congress, a computer security bill which does have the dimension of fellowships for computer security. Even that is not enough. Much more needs to be done. We have also been pushing teacher training in technology, not so much looking at the higher education, but more education from K through , to make sure that even those teachers know something about how to use technology because the youngsters do, so they can also inspire them. My legislation for women and minorities and disabled in science, engineering and technology, the commission is meeting, it will be coming up with its recommendations to get more of those groups that have traditionally not been involved, involved in those fields. Well, I thank you. I am going to now---- Mr. Horn. If you might yield on that point---- Mrs. Morella. I am going to recognize you for your questioning. Mr. Horn. Your associations could do a lot of good in bringing together the people from the Silicon Valleys of this Nation, and the community college teachers in particular. When you think that these programmers get about $ , when they are out of college or out of the community college, and what we need, speaking now as a Californian where we started the community college movement and we have about campuses from San Diego to the Oregon border, and they should be talking to the Silicon Valley types and vice versa. Because the State will never have enough money to get the equipment that is needed to educate people on to meet the people's needs as they go into the industry. It just seems to me there ought to be a summit meeting that perhaps your group, Mr. Miller, or your group and friends in the publishing world, and getting all these people in the room. When you think of what Jamie Escalante, the great teacher in L.A., that took young people that everybody had given up on and they got right at the top of the college boards, and it can be done. We need to do that and we need to get the Mexican Americans, Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Americans, whatever they are, into seeing a point in their lives where they can make a substantial income. That is only going to happen if we start, as the chairman here said, concerning the K through . That is fine. But I think the K through and have to be considered, where their role, really, is to be either an academic program or a vocational program. In this case it is both. You need the academic background. You also need the vocational background. And you need the opportunity to work on equipment that makes sense. I know from what I had to go through with a very--probably the largest school of engineering west of Texas A&M, and we were just swamped with problems on equipment in the 's and the 's. Finally, our trustees stepped up to the plate and said OK, so we will pay engineers more, we will pay people in the business school more. Well, that doesn't solve all the problems, because the equipment is the problem, and the millions that takes. And that is where it is everybody's self interest to do something along that line. Now, I don't know if you want to add anything to that or if you are willing to do that conference, but we ought to get them in the same room with the American Electronics Association and so forth. Mr. Miller. We tried to do that the last couple of years, Mr. Chairman. We are making progress. I think that the IT community discovered the community college system very recently in a sense. They didn't previously think of it as a resource, except for some chip manufacturing companies, which didn't see the need for a -year degree. So you had a couple of instances in Arizona, particularly where Maracopa Community College was training people to work in the cleaning rooms for some of the major chip manufacturers. But I think the IT industry at large didn't see the community college as a good resource. We held our first national work force convocation at the University of California at Berkeley in January , and I think that is the first time that the IT industry began to understand that the community colleges were willing to be flexible, and, frankly, they can change a lot more quickly than formal -year universities, I am sure you know as a former university president. Mr. Horn. You are absolutely correct. You won't get your supply from Berkeley. They are wonderful people. It is true. They have research designs. Ph.Ds, there is a use for some of those, face it, but you want the worker people, which does take skill, which does take imagination, and some day they might be running their own Silicon Valley firm. That is the way the whole evolution of that Santa Clara Valley has happened. Mrs. Morella. I used to teach, at a community college in Montgomery County. Mr. Horn. Absolutely. Mr. Miller. It is happening. Yesterday the National Commission on the st Century Workforce had its second field hearing, it was actually held at De Anza in Silicon Valley, and I know that that is a focus of attention. I spoke at a major event that the Houston Partnership held months ago, and virtually every attendee was there from a community college. So I think the communication is starting. We are having our third convocation in Chicago in April of this year, and have invited many of the colleges to participate. The key to the community college is obviously getting support of the State legislatures to get the funding to be able to offer the courses. In most cases State legislatures do seem willing to do that. Mr. Horn. They see it helps their economy. Mr. Miller. It is an economic development issue, not an education issue. That is what employers want to know, if I move my business there, where am I going to get my IT workers. Mr. Horn. You might have covered this while I was going over to vote, but when you look at the issues that confronted the Nation that I mentioned to Mr. Koskinen on the domestic side, do you have any particular issues that relate to technology that you think we ought to have that kind of operation that we have had in the last few years where you have somebody on behalf of the President pulling these things together, if it affects the economy and efficiency of the executive branch, which is the jurisdiction of my particular subcommittee? So what would your themes be that somebody ought to be looking at? Mr. Miller. Well, I have a couple. One we discussed, I think, at a previous hearing, which is an information security czar. I think that the Koskinen model is also applicable to the information security area. Right now, Mr. Chairman, if someone from academia came up and put a chart up on the wall of how information security is handled inside the government, I don't think that wall is big enough to put all the boxes up there, because it is split over so many places. Everyone is well intentioned and has good purposes. Mr. Horn. With the Chief Information Officer role being pretty much throughout the major agencies, hasn't that helped? Mr. Miller. That is very helpful. But, again, even there, that is just within the particular agency. We are also talking about interrelationship with the private sector, and depending on who you ask, to percent of critical infrastructure we have to protect is in the private sector. Yet we have to coordinate with the government. Who do we coordinate with? Do we coordinate with Mrs. Morella's favorite office, the CIAO office, or do we coordinate the NIPC, or do we coordinate with the National Security Council or the Commerce Department? It goes on and on and on. So we are looking for simplicity. The great thing about Mr. Koskinen's office was it was a little bitty office. He couldn't do a lot. What he could do was he could be an enabler, he could be a man who cracks the whip and try to get you to move quickly. But at the end of the day, you had to do it. He was never going to try to superimpose his own bureaucracy, either on the private sector or on a government agency. That is what I mean by a czar, not somebody that literally dictates what the private sector or the Federal agencies do. Mr. Burbano has to decide what the State Department does, Mr. Cosgrave has to understand what the IRS does. But someone who can coordinate and pull that all together, I think that would be very helpful. Mr. Horn. Well, they have a council, and I don't know how active that was before this assignment was given them, but they certainly ought to be working on the consensual part. Of course, what I am after is, and I will be putting it in shortly, is the office of management idea where the President has somebody there that knows something about management, not just the budget. Every President puts in a director that is either an accountant or politician or economist, but they don't put anybody in that knows a thing about management, that has the President's ear. So I want to split that off, and, fine, keep the director of the budget, but make a director of management. Roosevelt had that, Truman had it, Eisenhower had it. It went downhill starting with Kennedy and right through Reagan. They all politicized the Bureau of the Budget, which were professionals, and they served every President, whether they were Democrats or Republicans. It didn't matter. It didn't matter what their party was. They were professionals. And we have lost that contingent, until we got into this situation. When we wrote the President and said look, you have got to put somebody in charge, because it is going nowhere, and nothing but procrastination, and he did. He made a good choice. The same thing I wrote him with Rossotti. I said look, every President has put in tax attorneys and tax accountants, how about getting a chief executive for the job. And he did a great job in getting Mr. Rossotti. So you had two splendid appointments that turned agencies around. Mr. Miller. Absolutely. Mr. Cosgrave, who was the CIO of IRS, was previously a CEO of a company, was actually on my board of directors, and Mr. Rossotti recruited him to come and fix the Y K problem and run that. I certainly agree with you, Mr. Chairman. I guess another thing I would say in terms of a theme is with all due respect to my friends in the Federal Government who bemoan the fact there are not enough Federal IT workers, I think they are trying to stop this tide, and they are not going to win this battle. We try to help them, we meet with CIO council, et cetera, to try to figure out how the Federal Government is going to recruit more IT workers. But I think in the long-term trend they are going to lose. If they are going to lose, I would rather see them focus attention on the transition to a world where there is much more IT functionality outsourced, rather than trying to constantly refight this battle of what are they going to rejigger in the OPM manual to somehow recruit a few more IT workers. And that does not slight the Federal IT work force. I think they are great people. But I think they are just fighting a losing trend, because the delta between the Federal sector pay and the private sector pay is getting bigger and bigger. The benefits for people going into the private sector are much higher. My members never liked to voluntarily attract someone out of the Federal marketplace, because they are making their customers mad at them, but the reality is you can't throw away a resume when someone sticks one in your hand and says I want to get paid or or percent more, I want to come work for your company, than I can make working in the Federal marketplace. So I think one of the issues your subcommittee wants to look at is how do you do that transition. I think it is going to happen, and to do it smartly rather than constantly trying to smart stop the tide I think would be a much more productive use of resources. Mr. Horn. We would welcome any thoughts you have on this. I know we are already in touch with you at the staff level for the computer security hearing coming up soon. Mr. Beach. Mr. Chairman, I would like to comment briefly on your summit idea. I think that it is a very good idea and encourage you to consider submitting an op-ed piece we could run in CIO Magazine that would bring it to the attention of about , people. I like the idea of director of management for one reason. Again, I was referencing earlier the CIO Know Pulse Poll that we recently did that shows within months, in in the private side of the business are going to have e-business, and it is going to be their core business model. And how you have kept the feet to the fire for the Federal agencies here leading up to Y K, I think this director of management, whoever he or she is, should have as one of their tasks to make certain that all the agencies and the millions and billions of dollars that the U.S. Government has spent to upgrade its systems, how are these being used, what new services, what new applications are you providing for getting our bang for a buck. Getting back to the previous question, Mr. Rossotti mentioned I think that in the IRS, they upgrade each year one- third of their computers. So what happens to the third that are being thrown out? Where are these going? The other issue is there is a great opportunity in the junior colleges and the - year schools for the faculty could be adjunct faculty from the business community. These are the men and women who know most about its leading technologies. I would encourage a program of adjunct faculty to our Nation's community colleges are -year schools. Mr. Horn. You are absolutely correct, because the research universities are simply too involved in long-term research, which does have a payoff in many ways. A lot of our industry is based on that research. But in terms of getting a curriculum turned around, as you correctly viewed, that can happen much more easily in a community college. Rather than have the faculty say let's think about this for years. So that is part of the problem. This is a national crisis in skills. On the Clinger-Cohen Act, we are focusing partly on the information technology human resources issues and the need for qualified individuals and managers when that comes up. And that's another one coming up in the next few weeks. So let me skip to something else that isn't as serious as what we've had here, but I guess I'd want to ask Ms. Hotka that I'm just curious with the wonderful technology we have to trace everything in the stores of America, do you know how many generators were turned in? Ms. Hotka. We were sure, Mr. Chairman, that we would see this mass return of generators which would then be refused at the store level by stores who said that they wanted to sell it to you instead of lend it to you. We were amazed instead that stores used this as a customer retention mechanism. They said please, come back and return it and while you're here, buy something else. Mr. Horn. I was educated yesterday by my staff when I raised this that there was such a thing as a stocking fee and tell me about that. Ms. Hotka. What some of our retailers did was to charge a restocking fee so that if you brought back the generator after January in the box because you didn't need it, that they would charge percent. Some of them did that, did in fact charge that fee but some of them I think surprised all of us and used this as a way to get those valued customers back into the store and while they were there, by the way, why don't you buy this Christmas tree which is on deep discount and it worked beautifully. We saw very little demand--that was one of the things that surprised us too. We thought that the public was going to flock into stores at the end of the year and buy all kinds of stuff. We didn't see it at all. Mr. Miller. If I could make one point about your CIO elevation on the last question, I want to bring to your attention a new institution which the Virginia secretary of technology Don Upson is creating called the CIO Academy. I don't know if he's publicly rolled this out yet, but I know he's already recruited several State CIOs to be on the board of directors. He's recruited Jim Flyzik who is the CIO of the Department of Treasury who was kind enough to ask me to do it. He's got some other people from the private sector. I think this relates to the whole issue that you, of course, implemented within Clinger Cohen which is elevating the whole position of the CIO within the organization. And obviously one of the major roles that Mr. Beach's publication does is it also creates a network through his publication, his polls, his meetings he sponsors. I think Secretary Upson tends to do this in a much more educational level. I think you're going to see more and more where this is going. Now, the challenge, and I think, Mr. Beach, you had an article in your publication recently about whether the CIO job will even exist in years. You had some futurists discussing that. I think one of the conclusions was there would be no such position, maybe a chief knowledge officer or something else like that but there wouldn't be a CIO because technology will become so ubiquitous that the idea that you have a specialist would be like saying you have a telephone specialist. That won't exist anymore. Generally, I think business and government are paying a lot more attention to the whole role of the CIO and part of it is because of Y K again. It all rolls back to the fact that Y K suddenly brought to the attention of the CIO and the CFO and board of directors that this guy or gal who ran the technology wasn't some person who you could just put off on the side of the back room, that he or she was fundamental to your strategic business or strategic government delivery of services. Mr. Horn. In educating a CIO, what is your percentage of technology versus management skills? Mr. Miller. I'd say knowledge of technology is somewhere between and percent, management understanding business, understanding the core operation is probably about percent. I think the same way as a CFO. I don't think you expect the CFO to be your bookkeeper. The CFO is your financial planner, business organizer. I think the same thing is true of your CIO you don't expect him or her to be necessarily the chief technical person, that he or she is the person who is looking at how the technology fits into the business organization. Mr. Beach probably has some surveys on that I'm sure. Mr. Beach. We've got lots of them. It's along with what Harris said. I mentioned it several times here today that what has happened is that technology and e-business and e-commerce and the overuse of the letter ``E'' but what has happened is that there has got to be an extension to a company's business model. So technology has gone from being an extension of how we govern to being the core--a core part of that infrastructure of how we govern. I would agree with the percentages of Harris that the more successful CIOs that I see are those men and women who have a keen understanding not of technology but of their customers because then they could always use technology to service that customer need rather than saying I know everything about fiber and all this other stuff, you say let's go find a customer to satisfy that. So they are more customer-focused, and smart businesses and smart governments are realizing that technology is going to be a core platform in terms of how they provide a good or service. Mr. Horn. Does your magazine take a look at how Y K made us learn that we can now better manage the operation once we had to get in and say let's merge this system with that system or let's just get rid of it? To what degree do you see that movement in the executive branch? Mr. Beach. In the executive branch here in Washington? Mr. Horn. Right or the field. Mr. Beach. I think the lesson learned from the CIOs in the private sector, what Y K taught them is that no one is an island, that all these businesses are connected in these global supply chains. And I can't comment particularly on the question of executive branch, but I would say that you--no one aspect of the government, whether it's legislative, the judicial, or the executive is--it's never been that way, but technology is giving each of those branches a better opportunity to communicate and share information and govern in ways that we haven't thought of. Ms. Hotka. If I can expand on that too. I think one of the things that we found was Y K was such a flash point, that if I called up someone from a company who's not a member and said I need to talk to you about Y K, I could get that person on the phone instantly. It cut across all kinds of company barriers. There was no competitiveness at all. We had an immovable deadline and an issue that everybody understood and so everyone was willing to talk to everyone. If we can come to some kind of goal like that, obviously we'll not have this again. And thank God for it, but if we could come up with some kind of goal for technology literacy and for good corporate use of IT, we could again get to that point where I could pick up the phone and get anybody on the phone and be able to cooperate. It was useful. If we can harness that again it would be terrific. Mr. Horn. I think you're right. I've got just one or two things to say here, and then I'm going to leave and Mrs. Morella, she reminds me we have a conference, all of us at p.m. Let me say without objection, I want to file within the testimony when after Mr. Koskinen, an exchange of letters between the Secretary General of the United Nations and myself. Mrs. Morella. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Horn. No. , I would like to thank the following people that have been involved and not just in this hearing but in most of our hearings. From the subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology, J. Russell George, staff director and chief counsel; Matthew Ryan, senior policy director; Bonnie Heald, director of communications and professional staff member; Chip Ahlswede, chief clerk and unfortunately it's his last hearing with us; Deborah Oppenheim, intern; and minority staff, Trey Henderson, the counsel; and Jean Gosa, minority staff assistant; and for the Technology Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Jeff Grove, staff director; Ben Wu, counsel; Vicki Stackwick, staff assistant; the technical minority staff is Michael Quear, the professional staff member; and Marty Ralston, staff assistant; and our two court reporters today are Bob Cochran and Laurie Harris. And we thank you all for what you're doing. In closing on my behalf, I would say governments and industries worldwide have benefited from this experience. I think that testimony was very clear today. This problem has many silver linings as our witnesses have described. There are equally as many if not more people who have worked tirelessly in an effort to solve the year computer problem, and we saw some of them before us today. Obviously Mr. Koskinen is Assistant to the President and Chair of the Council on the Year Conversion. The General Accounting Office staff, particularly that staff headed by Mr. Willemssen, who was here today. Federal, State, and local government personnel, the private sector, individual grass roots organizations, and the two staffs I've mentioned and the technology subcommittee which has been our partner in overseeing this massive and unique experience and we thank them and this success demonstrates what can be accomplished with leadership, focus, and dedication, and it's a great legacy to begin this new millennium and we thank all of you for your hard work. I thank the chairwoman. Mrs. Morella. I thank you, Mr. Horn. You've expressed it very well for all of us. Hardly a time to ask another question. I guess my final one is now as we look into the near future, any comments about February and this concept of windowing? Has that been taking place and is it anything that we should be looking into, comment on, enlighten the public on? Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller. The companies would take the same attitude that you heard expressed by Mr. Koskinen and the panel this morning. They don't expect very many problems with February , but they are maintaining diligent oversight of the problem. Every leap year there's a problem. I hate to tell you, whether it's supposed to be or not supposed to, there's problems so it's not unique. I think there will be diligence, but I wouldn't expect any major problems. As far as windowing again, in a way it's postponing the problem. I think the expectation is it's been postponed long enough. It will be OK, but we got fooled last time around. There's another windowing problem which you may know about, which is not necessarily this subcommittee's concern, which there is a gentleman who has a patent on windowing who wants a lot of companies to pay him a lot of money for that. But that right now is a matter before the patent office and perhaps a matter before the court so probably Congress doesn't want to touch that one right now. Ms. Hotka. When we did our testing, when retail companies went through and tested all the systems they thought were fine, the No. thing that came up with was leap year. We don't expect the world to come to an end. We think you'll still be able to shop, but if I had to pick one thing that I thought was going to be funky that is it. We'll be in the ICC again. Mr. Beach. I would just make a comment on the windowing that I believe Eduardo and the previous panel mentioned it that keeping an inventory of those applications that have been windowed might be wise. I'd like to know where those are in years. I don't think we should make the mistake that we made in the 's and 's that these applications are not going to---- Mrs. Morella. Exactly. Even when you think of the 's, the -year span whoever thought we would now be in the year . Any final comments that you'd like to make? I want to thank you all very much for again being here, sharing your expertise, and also for all that you have done to make this Y K millennium bug be squashed. I thank you very much. So we now adjourn the meeting. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] [The prepared statement of Hon. James A. Barcia follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . "

UTILITY-SCALE SOLAR POWER: OPPORTUNITIES AND OBSTACLES ---------- MONDAY, MARCH , House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, Committee on Science and Technology, Washington, DC. The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at : p.m., in the Pima County Administration Building Hearing Room, st Floor, W. Congress Street, Tucson, Arizona, Hon. Gabrielle Giffords [Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] field hearing charter SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Utility-Scale Solar Power: Opportunities and Obstacles monday, march , : p.m.- : p.m. pima county administration building hearing room, st floor w. congress street tucson, arizona Purpose On Monday, March , the House Committee on Science & Technology, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment will hold a hearing entitled, ``Utility-Scale Solar Power: Opportunities and Obstacles,'' at the Pima County Administration Building Hearing Room, Tucson, Arizona. The Subcommittee's hearing will explore the potential for utility- scale solar power to provide a significant fraction of U.S. electric generating capacity and the challenges to achieving this goal. The specific technologies to be discussed include solar thermal technology, concentrating photovoltaics and distributed solar power. Transmission, regulatory and financial issues will also be examined, along with a look at the government and private industry roles in the development of utility-scale solar power--and enabling productive partnerships between them. Witnesses Mr. Mark Mehos is the Program Manager for the Concentrating Solar Power Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Mr. Mehos will provide an overall assessment of the available resource size for solar energy in the U.S. and an introduction to the known technologies that may take advantage of solar power on a large scale. Mr. Tom Hansen is the Vice President of Environmental Services, Conservation and Renewable Energy at Tucson Electric Power. Mr. Hansen will describe a ``Solar Grand Plan'' to provide more than half of the U.S.'s electricity from solar power by . Ms. Kate Maracas is the Vice President of Arizona operations at Abengoa Solar. Ms. Maracas will describe the current state of solar thermal technology and the near- and long-term economic costs and benefits of large-scale solar power in general. Ms. Valerie Rauluk is the Founder and CEO of Venture Catalyst, Inc. Ms. Rauluk will describe the current state of distributed and concentrating photovoltaics and provide an assessment of how the marketplace for solar energy will change over the next years. Ms. Barbara Lockwood is the Manager of Renewable Energy for Arizona Public Service. Ms. Lockwood will provide the perspective of utilities on the ability for large-scale solar power to be a significant competitor in the U.S. energy sector over the next years. Mr. Joe Kastner is the Vice President of Implementation and Operations for MMA Renewable Ventures LLC. Mr. Kastner will describe his company's experience with installing and managing the Nellis Air Force Base solar array and ways to enable productive partnerships between government and renewable energy industries in general. Background An article in the January issue of Scientific American titled ``A Solar Grand Plan'' outlined a potential path to providing nearly percent of U.S. electricity demand and percent of its total energy demand, including transportation, with solar power by . It is also estimated that if fully implemented, the plan would reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to percent below levels. Approximately $ billion in various government subsidies from to would be required to fund the necessary infrastructure and make solar power cost-competitive. Several types of technology would be needed to follow through on such a plan. Photovoltaics (PV), which convert sunlight directly to electricity, are the most familiar. Vast arrays of PV cells can be deployed in the Southwest covering multiple square miles to generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity per field. A variation on this technology, known as concentrating photovoltaics (CPV), uses lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto high-efficiency solar cells. These solar cells are typically more expensive than conventional cells used for flat-plate PV systems. However, the concentration decreases the required cell area while also increasing the cell efficiency. PV and CPV systems may employ any of a number of electrical energy storage technologies for use during periods of passing clouds or into the evening. An alternate technology could also be used. Solar thermal technology produces electric power by converting the sun's energy into high-temperature heat with various mirror configurations. The heat is then used to power a conventional generator. Solar thermal plants consist of two parts: one that collects solar energy and converts it to heat and another that converts heat energy to electricity. Just as batteries may assist PV systems, molten salts and other forms of thermal energy storage technology allow this heat to be retained for later use in generating electric power. An expansive new transmission and distribution system would be required for the remainder of the country to take full advantage of the immense solar resource in the American Southwest. A study commissioned by the Western Governors' Association estimated that solar energy from the Southwest alone could provide up to , GW of electricity to the U.S. To put this in perspective, the electric generating capacity of the entire country is currently about , GW. However, the existing system of alternating-current (AC) power lines would lose a significant fraction of its energy over long hauls so the Solar Grand Plan recommends building a new backbone of high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) power transmission lines and coupling this to sites near population centers that may utilize another form of electrical energy storage technology known as compressed air energy storage (CAES). Under this scheme, electricity generated from solar power plants hundreds of miles away compresses air and pumps it into vacant underground caverns, abandoned mines, aquifers and depleted natural gas wells. The pressurized air is released on demand to turn a turbine that generates electricity, aided by burning small amounts of natural gas. Citing a study by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the natural gas industry, the Plan affirms that suitable geologic formations exist in percent of the country often close to metropolitan areas, and that a national CAES system would look similar to the current U.S. natural gas storage system. The Plan assumes relatively small increases in PV solar-to-electric efficiency from percent today to percent in and increases in efficiency for solar thermal technology from to percent. The Plan also assumes significant reductions in installed cost and electricity price based on economies of scale reaching - cents/kWh. (Today's rates for these systems in the U.S. are - cents/kWh and average overall electricity rates are currently - cents/kWh depending on the region.) Though not directly addressed by the Solar Grand Plan, one other method to generate solar power on a large scale is distributed generation (DG) which consists of smaller facilities on otherwise unused real estate (roof-tops and sites of to acres) located near the load demand and dispersed throughout many communities. DG systems typically produce under MW of power and may consist of PV and CPV components. By providing power near or directly at the point of use, DG may offer a more cost-effective near-term solution in many areas of the country. Ms. Giffords. This hearing will come to order. Good morning, everyone. It is my great, great honor and privilege to welcome you all this morning to a field hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment entitled ``Utility-Scale Solar Power: Opportunities and Obstacles.'' I want to welcome everyone here to Tucson. I want to thank Chairman Richard Elias for having us here in the Supervisor's Headquarters. Richard, where are you? Thank you so much for having us here today. We also have with us Councilwoman Nina Trasoff. Thank you for all the work that you are doing, one of our local elected officials, I appreciate having all your support. Rarely does a meeting in Congress go by when I do not have an opportunity to talk to my colleagues about how extraordinary southern Arizona is, and so that is one of the reasons why I am so pleased to have so many of our colleagues here with us today to enjoy this extraordinary part of the world that we call home. Many thanks to my colleagues who are interested in utility- scale solar power for coming. All have given up time in their district work periods to be here in southern Arizona. We are honored to have Members from around the country with us today. I believe it is a testament to the high degree of energy and interest that we have in solar technology. In particular, I would like to extend a very special welcome to the two most senior Members of the Science and Technology Committee. The Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Bart Gordon from Tennessee, unfortunately, was detained in Washington due to weather and mechanical problems with his airplane, but he is going to be joining us by telephone in just a few minutes. But, I would like to thank Ranking Member, Mr. Ralph Hall from Texas. Ralph Hall has been on the Science and Technology Committee for years, and also Energy and Commerce. So, we are very pleased to have him with us today. Also with us is Representative Dan Lipinski of Illinois, Vice Chair of the Full Committee, Representative Jim Matheson from the State of Utah, thank you for coming, and Representative Harry Mitchell, a fellow Member of the Arizona Congressional Delegation, from Tempe, Arizona. No one can remember the last time that we had so many Members of Congress in southern Arizona for an actual field hearing. So, I am particularly pleased that we are all here on a topic as important as solar energy. I would like to extend a very warm welcome to our witnesses who are here today. We are glad that you are here to share in your expertise, to enlighten the Committee and members of the public about the experiences that you have and the thoughts that you have. It was challenging to only have six panelists when we have so many talented people that are experts in solar technology, but we are very pleased that you are here to join with us today. We also have many smart and talented members of my Solar Advisory Committee that are in the audience today, and I want to thank you as well for taking this part of the world and making it so focused on solar energy and the possibilities that lay ahead of us. Finally, a welcome to all the members as well, just of the general public, who are here because they care about what is happening with the future of energy technology, and again, I want to thank you, our Members today, but also watching live on the Internet, and we know we have a streaming video and we will capture that for people who are not able to participate. In the Science and Technology Committee, it is common for our Chairman, Mr. Gordon, to refer to us as the Committee of big ideas. The notion is certainly well grounded from the history of the Committee. Just last week we celebrated years of the Science and Technology Committee, with Bill Gates coming to talk to us. It is a Committee that oversaw the days of NASA and winning the space race, the wake of Sputnik, but the Chairman's statement is as much, I believe, about the future as it is about the past. It expresses a belief which I share, that the greatest days of American innovation are the days which lay ahead. So, in my view, it could not be more fitting for the Committee to turn its attention to solar power. Solar power is a big idea, whose time has come. And, like the space program, solar is an idea that can shape our nation in significant and positive ways. In the coming months, in the coming years, we will face critical decisions on how to address climate change, reduce our dependence on foreign energy, and boost our economic competitiveness. The beauty of solar power is that it offers an elegant solution to all three of these challenges. Imagine what it would be like if every time that it rained it rained oil, big black drops falling from the sky. Don't you think that we would find some way to run around with a big bucket and collect all of that energy that was falling from the sky? I know this sounds like an absurd picture, but the reality is that what we have outside today is something very comparable to that. Literally, we have useful energy pouring out of the sky, and nowhere does it rain sunshine with greater intensity and consistency than in the American southwest. In fact, some studies show that there is enough sunshine in the southwest to power almost our entire nation. One of these studies was recently covered on--actually, was brought forward on the front cover of the ``Scientific American Magazine.'' So, in other words, the southwest is home to a national treasure that streams from the sky almost every day. That sounds like a good enough reason to start developing an effective solar bucket, and while we are at it, let us make it a really big bucket. The focus of this hearing is not just about any kind of solar power, it is about utility-scale solar power. Utility- scale refers to large installations that can generate significant amounts of electricity for the grid, but with free fuel and, virtually, no pollution. Developing solar installations on this scale creates unique opportunities, but it also presents unique challenges. So, we look forward today to hearing from our witnesses about both. Our goals in holding this hearing are to explore five key issues. First, the potential scale of solar power in America. Second, the current state of technology. Third, the benefits to our nation of embracing this energy source. Fourth, the obstacles to developing solar power in a big way. And finally, the policies that can help us overcome these obstacles. The time for solar is now. Technologies are proving, the costs are falling, and the reasons to adopt it are compelling. We need to truly understand the potential of this energy source and how we can unleash it. So, that is what today's hearing is all about. So, we should get started. Since we do not have Congressional hearings in Tucson every day, I want to briefly explain how we are going to proceed. First, some of my colleagues will make opening statements. Then we will have a chance to hear from each of the witnesses in turn. We ask our witnesses, because of our time consideration, to keep their testimony to five minutes, and we have our technology here on the table to indicate when your time is being close to up. Then, following the witnesses, each Member will have five minutes to ask questions. Once all the Members have asked questions, if time remains we will have a chance to recycle and go back to the beginning. I know that some of my colleagues have planes to catch, so we are planning on wrapping up around : . Now, following the conclusion of the formal hearing, I would like to take a short ten-minute break. I encourage people who are interested in the community to stay around, because we are going to ask our panelists to come on the dias and be able to directly answer your questions. With that, I would now like to yield to Mr. Hall for his opening statement. [The prepared statement of Acting Chair Giffords follows:] Prepared Statement of Acting Chair Gabrielle Giffords Good morning. It is my great privilege today to convene this field hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy & Environment, entitled ``Utility-Scale Solar Power: Opportunities and Obstacles.'' I want to welcome everyone to Tucson. Rarely does a hearing go by where I do not talk about Arizona so you can imagine what a pleasure it is to be able to show my fellow Committee Members why I am so proud of our community and the work we are doing together on Solar energy. Many thanks to my colleagues from the Science and Technology Committee. They have all given part of their District work period to come to southern Arizona today. We are honored to have with us Members from all over the country. This is a testament to the high level of interest in solar power, and to its relevance to the whole Nation. In particular, I would like to extend a very special welcome to the two most senior Members of the Full Science and Technology Committee: The Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Bart Gordon, of Tennessee, who was unfortunately detained in Washington due to weather and mechanical problems with his airplane. He should be joining us by phone in just a bit. And The Ranking Member, Mr. Ralph Hall, of Texas. Thank you both for coming. Also with us today are: Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, Vice Chair of the Full Committee, Rep. Jim Matheson from Utah, and Rep. Harry Mitchell, a fellow Member of the Arizona delegation. No one can remember the last time that so many Members of Congress came together in Tucson for a Field Hearing. I am particularly pleased that we are here on such an important topic. Thank you all for making the special effort to be here today. I would like to extend a very warm welcome to our witnesses. We are glad you are here to share your expertise with the Committee. It was an incredible challenge to narrow our panel down to just six. There are so many smart and talented people with important perspectives on these issues, including many members of my own Solar Advisory Council. I wish we could fit them all at the witness table, but space and time constraints prevent us from doing so. I thank all of these people for their important contributions to solar power and their work with my office on our solar initiatives. We value their expertise, and I will continue to seek their counsel and collaboration as we move forward. Finally, a special welcome to all the members of the community who are here today. Thank you for your interest in this critical issue. In the Science and Technology Committee it is common for our Chairman, Mr. Gordon, to refer to us as the ``Committee of Big Ideas.'' This notion is certainly well-grounded in history. Formed in the wake of Sputnik and initially charged with winning the space race, the Committee is now celebrating years of promoting big ideas in American science and technology. But the Chairman's statement is as much about the future as it is about the past. It expresses the belief--which I share--that the greatest days of American innovation lie ahead of us. So in my view it could not be more fitting that the Committee is turning its attention to solar power. Solar is a BIG IDEA whose time has come. And like the space program, solar is an idea that can shape our nation in significant and positive ways. In the coming months and years, we will face critical decisions on how to address climate change, reduce our dependence on foreign energy, and boost our economic competitiveness. The beauty of solar power is that it offers an elegant solution to all three of these pressing concerns. Imagine what it would be like if every time it rained, it rained oil--big, black drops falling from the sky. Don't you think we'd find a way to catch some of that bounty from the heavens? I think we'd be running around with big buckets, scooping up every available drop. As absurd as that picture may be, with solar energy we have something just as good--useful energy that is literally pouring down from the sky. And nowhere does it ``rain'' sunshine with greater intensity and consistency than in the American Southwest. In fact, some studies show there's enough sunshine in the Southwest to power almost our entire country! One of these studies was recently reported in a cover story in Scientific American. In other words, the Southwest is home to a national treasure that streams from the sky almost every day. That sounds like a good reason to get serious about developing an effective solar bucket. And while we're at it, let's make it a big bucket. The focus of this hearing is not just any kind of solar power, it is utility-scale solar power. Utility-scale refers to large installations that can generate significant amounts of electricity for the grid, but with free fuel and no pollution. Developing solar installations on this scale creates unique opportunities, but it also has unique challenges. We look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about both. Our goals in holding this hearing are to explore five issues: the potential scale of solar power in America the current state of solar technology the benefits to our nation of embracing this energy source the obstacles to developing solar power in a big way, and the policies that can help us overcome those obstacles. The time for solar is now: technologies are improving, costs are falling, and the reasons to adopt it are increasingly compelling. We need to truly understand the potential of this energy source, and how we can unleash it. That's what today's hearing is about. Mr. Hall. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and I am honored to be here. What she did not tell you is that I am the oldest guy in the United States House of Representatives, and that makes me the dean. I am years old, but I was running at : this morning, two to three miles every morning. I am trying to stay young to keep up with my grandchildren. I get a little sick of some of them telling old man jokes, Madam Chair, about me. The latest one was that a woman's husband was about to quit golfing because he was , and he could not see where the ball was going. And, she hated to see him leave golf and be at home all the time. She said, well, my brother is and he does not golf but he likes exercise. He has wonderful vision and he can see, I will bet he could tell you where your ball went. And, they worked that out. That following Monday out on the golf course he hit that ball, and it was way up in the air. He said, Orville, are you watching it? He said, yeah, I am watching it. He said, is it still up there? He said, yeah. Can you see it? Yeah, I can see it. Has it hit yet? He said, yeah, just hit. He said, where did it go. And, he said, I cannot remember. So, us senior Members have problems of all kinds. But in this campaign--I just won the primary election, and the ``Dallas News'' called me an old geezer. And I made the argument, Madam Chairman, that it does not hurt to have--I do not recommend a whole floor of old -year-old guys or women, but it does not hurt to have one old geezer up there. And, I had all kind of call-ins and letters and everything, and finally the guy that won the contest told me my motto should be, ``Win One for the Geezer,`` and that is what we did. But, I am glad and honored to be here with you in Tucson, and this very important hearing on solar energy. I am anxious to listen. I am here more to listen than I am to talk. The longest speech I will make is one that I will be reading to you right now in a few minutes. I just want to say that I have often said that our country needs to become more energy independent, and to do that we need to use all the forms of energy. Americans, we have many forms of energy, and we just passed an energy bill a year and a half ago that had some incentive for every form of energy. And, energy is important, it is important in that if we solve our energy problems we also solve our war problems, because energy or lack of energy is the cause of most wars. It is the causation of it. Japan did not dislike this country. Cordell Hull and Henry Stimson had cut their oil off. They had months of national existence with no oil. So, we had to know they were going to break out and go south into Malaysia or somewhere. That was an energy war, it was not because they did not like us. Japan today is probably the best friend we have in the world, the best partner we have, I think. And, I would like to see them arm again, because they know how to deal with the Chinas, and the Koreas, and all that, but that is not what we are here about today. We are here about energy, and, of course, when George Bush, the elder George Bush, sent , youngsters to Iraq ten or years ago, that was to keep a bad guy named Saddam Hussein from getting his foot on half the known energy in that part of the world. That was an energy war, in my opinion. And, that is how important this hearing is, and solar is such an important part of energy. A balanced solution can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy, and that is one thing we really need to do, to make our air and water cleaner, most importantly, a viable solution reduces the cost of energy for Americans so that their economy can continue to grow. As demand rises by an estimated percent in the electricity sector by , we are going to need solutions that keep America economically prosperous and competitive. As is evident here in the desert of the American southwest, the sun provides an abundant source of energy. Citizens have been using this source for years to power many small and some large-scale projects and devices. And, an entire small community of astronauts live on the International Space Station that is run entirely on solar energy. Yet, solar energy makes up a very small proportion of our overall consumption picture, only . percent of global energy demand is met by geothermal solar and wind energy combined. In the United States, statistics by the Department of Energy from indicate that solar energy accounted for one percent of the total U.S. energy consumption, and . percent of our electricity generation. Part of the reason this resource is not widely used is that sunlight is not constant, it is not focused. The amount of energy generated depends on the time of day, location, and weather conditions. In order to use solar energy for stable grid operations, we need better storage techniques. To this end, I introduced a bill last year, the Energy for America Act, which included the provision permitting research and development and demonstration of energy storage technologies for electricity transmission and distribution. I am pleased that this provision was included in the energy bill signed into law last year. So, Madam Chair, I look forward to hearing this testimony today by this very esteemed panel of individuals, on how America can better harness the power of the sun to generate more utility-scale power that lowers the cost to taxpayers and consumers. We write law up there. We write the law, but we write it based on people that know more about what we are talking about than we do, and that is this panel and people just like you. We will take your testimony, the rest of this committee, and the rest of Congress will have the opportunity to read it. Some of them will read it, but it can be the major part of a bill that would be introduced later, probably by Madam Chair with many of us being her co-sponsors. With that, I thank you, and I yield back my time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Ralph M. Hall Thank you. I am pleased to be here today in Tucson, Arizona for this important hearing on solar energy and I want to thank Rep. Giffords for organizing this gathering. I have often said that America needs to become more energy independent, and to do that we need to use all forms of energy. Americans currently have, and will continue to need, reliable and affordable domestic energy. Citizens are rightfully concerned about rising energy prices and protecting the environment. A balanced solution reduces our dependence on foreign sources of energy while also making our air and water cleaner. Most importantly, a viable solution reduces the cost of energy for Americans so that our economy can continue to grow. As demand rises by an estimated percent in the electricity sector by , we will need solutions that keep America economically prosperous and competitive. As is evident here in the desert of the American Southwest, the sun provides an abundant source of energy. Citizens have been using this source for years to power many small and large-scale projects and devices. Indeed, an entire small community of astronauts live on an International Space Station that is run entirely on solar energy. Yet, solar energy makes up a very small proportion of our overall consumption picture. Only . percent of global energy demand is met by geothermal, solar, and wind energy combined. In the U.S., statistics by the Department of Energy from indicate that solar energy accounted for one percent of the total U.S. energy consumption, and . percent of our electricity generation. Part of the reason this resource is not widely used is that sunlight is not constant and focused. The amount of energy generated depends on the time of day, location, and weather conditions. In order to use solar energy for stable grid operations, we need better storage techniques. To this end, I introduced a bill last year, the Energy for America Act, which included a provision promoting the research, development, and demonstration of energy storage technologies for electricity transmission and distribution. I am pleased that this provision was included in the Energy Bill signed into law last year. I look forward to hearing the testimony today by this esteemed panel of individuals on how America can better harness the power of the sun to generate more utility-scale power that lowers the cost to taxpayers and consumers. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Hall. I would now like to yield to the Chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, Mr. Gordon, who will offer his opening remarks (by phone). Chairman Gordon. Thank you. I am disappointed as to the mechanical problem that I cannot join all of you in southern Arizona today, but I want to thank you, Representative Giffords, for taking the lead and putting together this important hearing, and I want to thank my colleague, Old Geezer, and the other colleagues there, for being on the scene, and I know you are going to be bringing back a good report for us. It is obvious that solar energy has the potential to provide a significant amount of power in Arizona, and I look forward to learning more about how states that do not get quite as much sun, like my own State of Tennessee, might be able to benefit from the tremendous resource we have in the southwest. And again, I would point out that in Germany installed about seven times more solar power than the entire U.S., and that Germany's solar resources are roughly equal to Alaska's. So, I know that we can be doing much more to utilize the sun's energy. It is clear that a major component of any scheme to use solar power on a large scale has to be energy storage. So, I am encouraged by the grand solar plan that Mr. Hansen will be describing. Additionally, further development in advanced batteries will also be a critical part of the distributed generation system that Ms. Rauluk will talk more about. I am pleased about the bipartisan work last year on the energy storage, which had official contributions in this area from both you, Madam Chair, and Mr. Hall, as it was introduced in the latest energy bill and became law in December. An improved transmission system is also needed, especially, if we ever expect to get a large fraction of our energy from remote regions where renewable resources, like solar and wind, are concentrated. I am also concerned about the nexus between water and energy, something that we are going to be looking into more this year on the Committee. While regular solar panels do not need much water, except to clean them on occasion, some estimate that solar thermal technology uses more water than a typical coal plant. So, it is important that while we move forward we take the whole picture into account, and do everything we can to avoid trading one big problem for another. And, I am excited about the opportunities that large-scale solar power present to create thousands of new green jobs, and reduce our dependency on old sources of energy. Our committee will continue to do everything we can to help overcome the barriers to getting us there. Representative Giffords, thank you again for your strong leadership to promote solar energy, and thanks to this distinguished panel of witnesses for being here today. I yield back my time. [The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:] Prepared Statement of Chairman Bart Gordon Thank you, Congresswoman, for taking the lead in putting together this important hearing. It is obvious that solar energy has the potential to provide a significant amount of power right here in Arizona, and I look forward to learning more about how states that don't get quite as much sun, like my home State of Tennessee might be able to benefit from the tremendous resource we have in the Southwest. Then again, I could point out that in , Germany installed about seven times more solar power than the entire U.S., and that country's solar resources are roughly equal to Alaska's, so I know that we could be doing much more to utilize the sun's energy. It's clear that a major component of any scheme to use solar power on a large scale has to be energy storage. I am encouraged that the Grand Solar Plan that Mr. Hansen will describe would make use of compressed air and thermal energy storage technologies. Further developments in advanced batteries will also be a critical part of the distributed generation systems that Ms. Rauluk will talk more about in just a few minutes. I'm proud that our committee's bipartisan work last year on energy storage, which had essential contributions in this area from both you and Mr. Hall, was included in the latest energy bill that became law in December. An improved transmission system is also needed especially if we ever expect to get a large fraction of our energy from the remote regions where renewable resources like solar and wind are concentrated. Our current system of power lines isn't robust enough to carry large amounts of power from these centers to consumers everywhere. Too much energy would be lost over the long distances between generation and delivery of power. Studies by Oak Ridge National Laboratory show that new high-voltage direct current lines lose far less energy than existing transmission lines over the same distances. They may also be more reliable and cheaper to build. I look forward to hearing more about the prospects for making these kinds of changes to our electric grid system from this panel. And I am also concerned about the nexus between water and energy. While regular solar panels really don't need much water except to clean them on occasion, some estimates show solar thermal technology using more water than a typical coal plant. It is important that, moving forward we take the whole picture into account and do everything we can to avoid trading one big problem for another. I am excited about the opportunities that large-scale solar power presents to create thousands of new green jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Our committee will continue to do everything we can to help overcome the barriers to getting us there. Representative Giffords, thank you again for your strong leadership to promote solar energy, and thanks to this distinguished panel of witnesses for being here today. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Next, I would like to yield to Representative Harry Mitchell, for his opening statement. Mr. Mitchell. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would also like to thank Chairman Gordon and Congresswoman Giffords for organizing this field hearing. As a fellow freshman Member of Congress, from the sunny State of Arizona, Ms. Giffords and I have a unique perspective on how to address our nation's energy crisis. We are lucky here in Arizona to enjoy over days a year of sunshine. We have a real opportunity to brighten our state's future by investing in solar energy research and technology. As solar technology advances, I believe that Arizona will be a leader in clean alternative energy production. Refocusing our energy production on alternative sources such as solar is critical for our national security and the environment. Moreover, investing in solar energy is vital to Arizona's economy. Recently, Arbengoa Solar, and Arizona Public Service, announced exciting plans to develop the Solana Generating Station, and that is a megawatt solar thermal energy plant, right here in the southwest. This will be the world's largest solar power plant. Solana will not only be a leading source of emission-free electricity, but it will also start significant development for Arizona. However, the Arbengoa and Arizona Public Service executives have candidly told us that the Solana project will not happen without the extension of essential solar tax credits. I am proud of the work that we have done in Congress to make sure that utility-scale solar projects, in particular, like Solana, continue to benefit from solar tax credits. Recently, I voted for, and the House passed, the Renewable Energy Conservation Act, which would extend the percent investment tax credit for solar energy property for eight years, through . For the first time, public utilities would also be able to claim this investment tax credit. I remain committed in doing what I can do in Congress to encourage further development and production of solar energy, and I would also like to thank two people from my district who are here to testify today. Barbara Lockwood is the Manager of Renewable Energy for Arizona Public Service, and Kate Maracas is the Vice President of Arbengoa Solar's Arizona Project. Both Arizona Public Service and Arbengoa are leaders in utility- scale solar energy and are working together to develop the Solana plant. I look forward to hearing more about what we can do to establish Arizona's reputation as the Solar State, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. I would like to yield a few minutes to Representative Matheson for his opening statement. Mr. Matheson. Well, thank you, Madam Chair. I will be very brief, because I am looking forward to hearing from the panel. But, I just do want to emphasize that the Science Committee is a very bipartisan committee in the House of Representatives. It is a committee that usually takes on a longer-term view on issues, and I think the issues before the Science Committee are really the issues that matter when you look out a couple of generations from now. Congresswoman Giffords, you have been a leader in advocating the solar energy issue. You are a great Member of the Science Committee, and I am really impressed with how you have brought this hearing together today, and I just want to acknowledge that in your freshman term you have already established yourself as a real champion for this issue, and I will yield back my time. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Matheson. Representative Lipinski. Mr. Lipinski. I just want to very briefly say, back in I was in th grade. We had a science fair. I did a science fair project on solar energy. It seems like in the--well, soon afterwards, we stopped having much interest in solar energy. It seemed like years ago that was the emerging energy technology, where we had all these concerns about high gas prices, what is going to happen with oil, our oil supply, but here we are years later, it feels like we are in the same place. It is very important that we do not make mistakes now that we made back then. So, that is why I am very happy that Congresswoman Giffords is holding this hearing today. You know, having this many Members of Congress come out to a field hearing just really shows how important the issue is, and the role that Congresswoman Giffords is playing here--you know, this is a freshman Member of Congress--to have all this out here. As Vice Chairman of the Science Committee, I think this is just a fantastic opportunity that we have here today. This is critical for the future of our country, and it is very important, critical for southern Arizona, certainly, and I look forward today to hearing from all the witnesses here today, and making sure that we do everything we can at the federal level so that we can take advantage of what is available, what solar energy makes possible for us. And, I know Congresswoman Giffords is going to be a leader in Congress in doing that. So, I yield back. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Smith follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Adrian Smith Thank you, Madame Vice Chairwoman. Nebraska is a state blessed with many natural resources, not least of which is sunshine. I have long held, and continue to believe, the United States needs to explore a diverse array of energy technologies. Solar energy is one of many technologies which hold exciting potential. It is one of our most ubiquitous and reliable resources. Although there are challenges associated with capturing and storing solar energy, they are not insurmountable. I believe solar energy will play an important role in our future energy security. I support policies which encourage innovation, research, development, and investment in renewable energy. We need to encourage long-term investments in solar energy, as well as wind energy, biofuels, nuclear power, and hydro-power. Our own domestic oil and gas resources should not be overlooked. Thank you, Madame Vice Chairman, and I look forward to working with you to further policies which will promote research, development, and investment in solar technologies and other energy resources, leading to better energy security and national security for every Nebraskan and every American. Ms. Giffords. Now we would like to hear from our panelists, our witnesses. We are going to start, with just a couple brief seconds of introduction. We are going to hear from Mr. Mark Mehos, who is the Program Manager for the Concentrating Solar Power Program at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado. So, thank you so much for being here. We are going to hear from Mr. Tom Hansen, who is Vice President of Environmental Services, Conservation and Renewable Energy, at Tucson Electric Power, also featured in the ``Scientific American Magazine'' article, so great to have you here as well. Ms. Kate Maracas is the Vice President of Arizona Operations at Abengoa Solar. We have heard a lot about your company and the proposed project. We are excited that you are here today as well. Ms. Valerie Rauluk is the Founder and CEO of Venture Catalyst, Inc. She is a passionate supporter of solar energy, but also speaks on behalf of the business community as well. So, Ms. Rauluk, thank you for being here. Ms. Barbara Lockwood is the Manager of the Renewable Energy for Arizona Public Service, APS, thank you for coming down from Phoenix, we welcome you. And finally, Mr. Joe Kastner, the Vice President of Implementation Operations for MMA Renewable Ventures, LLC. We are so pleased to have you in southern Arizona. Thank you so much. As I said earlier, our witnesses will have five minutes to present your oral testimony. Your written testimony will be inserted into the record, and when we are finished with the witnesses' testimony, remember that we will take turns asking questions of our witnesses. And, we will begin with you, Mr. Mehos, please. STATEMENT OF MR. MARK MEHOS, PROGRAM MANAGER, CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER PROGRAM, NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB, COLORADO Mr. Mehos. Okay, thank you, Madam Chairman, thank you Members of the Committee, for giving me the opportunity to speak today. I did provide written testimony and ask permission to provide a Power Point oral presentation. Much of my information is better viewed than discussed. So, I was asked to present information on, basically, some background on utility-scale solar power. I will do that. At NREL we have done a lot of analysis on the overall resource side for utility-scale solar generation in the U.S., especially with an emphasis on the southwest. I was asked to present information on what the Federal Government can do to facilitate deployment, and finally, what can the Federal Government do to kick start utility-scale solar. Real quickly on some background of utility-scale solar technologies. When we talk about utility-scale solar we are really talking about two different markets, solar with storage, which we call dispatchable generation, which I will discuss in a little bit, and solar without storage or, basically, non- dispatchable, meaning that it will generate electricity when the sun is shining. On the dispatchable storage, we are really talking about three categories of technologies, and there are variations within these that I do not have time to discuss, but there's the parabolic trough up on the top of the screen, the power tower over to the lower left, and finally the linear fresnel, which is an upcoming technology over on the lower right. Each of these technologies are thermal-based technologies, which means they use concentrated sunlight to generate heat that can then be converted to electricity using conventional steam sites. The solar without storage, or what we call the non- dispatchable technologies, are just that. They are, basically, they cannot use storage, and there is three technologies that can fall into this category, the dish engine, which is on your upper, or on the lower side of the screen now on your left, concentrating photovoltaic technologies, which is in the middle, and then finally flat plate PV technologies, just like those that are on the home, but in a much larger scale for utility-scale applications. On the top, most of these are built in very large installations, on the order of , , megawatts. People are even talking about much larger installations. Their economies of scale forced them toward that side. On the lower part of the screen, the non-dispatchables, typically, those are much smaller-scale technologies, on the order of kilowatts to tens of kilowatts, which can then be gained together to the similar megawatt plants for large utility-scale applications. So, I talked about the dispatchable technologies. Why do we, or why do utilities, like dispatchable power? Primarily, what we do with dispatchable power, is we collect a lot of that energy that is shining on our collectors during the daytime, we store a lot of that energy, or most of that energy, and we distribute that energy over a larger period of the day. So, what does that do for us? It gives us a much higher value for that energy collected. If we were just dispatching during the peak times of the day, that is a very high value period, certainly, but especially in the southwest when people come home and they turn on their air conditioners, and their TVs, and everything else, that peak load really does go throughout later into the evening and even into the night. And so, we are allowed to take on that higher value production later into the day, not just during the daytime. It also allows us to lower the cost of the technology, basically, taking what amounts to be a fairly high capital cost for any solar technology and amortizing that high capital cost over a larger number of hours, instead of operating annually at percent of the year, we can operate up to percent or even or percent of the year. So, it allows you to really take that energy and lower the cost, due to that larger amortization. Okay. So, you asked the question regarding what is the resource potential, so at NREL we have done a significant amount of analysis using geographic information systems as a start, to try to screen where the most economical locations for large-scale solar can make sense. Up in the upper left-hand corner, I show the unfiltered solar resource, basically, the darker red spots are where the highest solar resource exists. But, if I take this entire southwest region and compare that southwest region to anywhere else in the world the southwest is as high or higher than anyplace else in the world as far as its solar resource. But, that is not all we need to look at. We need to look at other exclusions that can lower the economic value of that. The first thing we want to do, on the upper right-hand corner, is to exclude those areas that have a lower solar resource. We picked six hours, six kilowatt hours per meter squared per day, not that in the long-term you could not build economic plants, but we were looking more in the near-term. On the lower left-hand corner, we start looking at land exclusions. This is utility-scale solar. Typically, plants can be as large as one square mile, for the APS plant three square miles, so we are looking at large tracts of land that we are not going to build in wilderness areas, we are not going to build in urban areas, and so we take those types of exclusions, and that is the lower left-hand corner. Finally, because we are trying to minimize costs for constructing the plant, we are looking at fairly flat land. That does not have to be the case for some technologies, the most aggressive case is in the lower right-hand corner where we have looked at just one percent slope land. So, when we do that, and we look at that fairly aggressive filtering scenario, we still have times the current U.S. generating capacity, just in that small percentage of land that is left over. The current U.S. capacity is about , gigawatts, and I am showing a solar capacity with those lands of , gigawatts of potential. Okay. So, you asked what can the Federal Government do to support this technology. I should say on that last map there are a couple items in my written testimony. One is, a lot of that land that I showed, while a lot of that lies on private lands, much of that lies on federal lands, on Bureau of Land Management lands, on Defense lands, so there is an effort within the Department of Energy to try to open access, to try to reduce barriers to permitting, for example, to putting some of these large scale solar plants on federal lands. And so, the Federal Government can continue to support that effort. Also based on that map, much of that solar resource, while it is located near existing load, located near existing transmission, much of that transmission is constrained, and so to the degree that the Federal Government can support regional efforts to try to extend that transmission into these high- value areas, whether it is solar, or whether it is wind, or other renewable resources, please continue that effort. Probably one of the most important near-term issues facing large-scale solar is the extension of the percent investment tax credit. So, this is a quick example of the cost reduction associated with going from a percent permanent investment tax credit to the percent investment tax credit, basically, about a percent reduction in cost, which does not seem like an awful lot, but this technology is right on the margin, as I will show in a second, that percent reduction in cost to make or break these systems. So, this is a curve based on a regional deployment system model developed at NREL, that competes solar technologies, wind technologies, against conventional technologies. I will not go into detail, but without an extension of the existing percent investment tax credit, in other words, just the percent investment tax credit, we see very little new penetration of utility-scale solar technology in the near-term. You do see it come on line in the long-term, as conventional costs start to rise, and as our costs start to reduce based on the R&D that happens within the laboratory system. If you do extend that percent tax credit by eight years, and it is important to note that a two-year extension does nothing, and eight-year extension will allow, according to our models, and we hear this out in the public sector, quite an increase, up to gigawatts in the near-term of this technology. So, the extension of the tax credit is extremely important. This just gives you a more visual representation of that, without the extension of the tax credit, and our model does go to , but this is the nearer-term look. You will get some initial penetration that is basically driven by some of the State portfolio standards, and that initial penetration will probably happen or years from now, but you will get some initial penetration, and this, basically, the colors show capacity in megawatts. So, low penetration. If you were to extend this investment tax credit by eight years to , in this case I am showing the data, then you are looking at significant penetration in Arizona, in California, down in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, all of these states driven, primarily, by the extension of this tax credit. You asked what would be needed to kick start utility-scale solar. Right now, within the DOE program, utility-scale solar is about $ million, primarily, focused on concentrating solar power of $ million budget, which is mostly photovoltaic and distributed generation. NREL and Sandia, at the request of DOE, did an exercise to see what could happen to accelerate utility-scale solar, and we estimated about $ million per year to achieve accelerated goals. Those accelerated goals included being competitive in intermediate load markets by , a five-year acceleration of the current goal, and to be competitive in carbon-constrained base load markets by , which was not a goal previously at all. To achieve those goals, there needs to be R&D emphasis on advanced thermal storage systems, and higher temperature systems, primarily, the troughs and the tower systems, which are the systems that are high temperature and allow for thermal storage. I believe that's the end of my presentation. [The prepared statement of Mr. Mehos follows:] Prepared Statement of Mark Mehos Madame Chairman, thank you for this occasion to present and discuss information related to opportunities and obstacles for utility-scale solar power. I am the Manager of the Concentrating Solar Power Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). NREL is located in Golden, Colorado, and is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary laboratory for research and development (R&D) of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. I am honored to be here and to speak with you today. I truly believe that solar power--both concentrating solar power and photovoltaic technologies--can provide a significant level of generating capacity in the United States if cost goals established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) can be achieved. Reaching these goals will require a carefully balanced blend of DOE and industry sponsored R&D and government policies. Introduction to Solar Technologies Solar energy can be converted into electricity by means of photovoltaic (PV) or concentrating solar power (CSP) systems. Photovoltaics is the technical word for solar panels that create electricity. Photovoltaic material converts sunlight directly into electricity through a device called a solar cell. When sunlight strikes a solar cell, electrons are dislodged, creating an electrical current that can be captured and harnessed to do useful work. Solar cells are connected together electrically to produce modules, and modules are mounted in PV arrays that can measure up to several meters on a side. Flat-plate PV arrays can be mounted at a fixed angle facing south, or they can be mounted on a tracking system, allowing the array to follow the sun in one or two axes to capture more sunlight over the course of a day. About to PV arrays can provide enough power for a household. However, for large electric utility or industrial applications, hundreds or thousands of arrays can be interconnected to form a single, large ``utility-scale'' PV system. Higher efficiency solar cells, because of their high cost, are better suited to operate under concentrated sunlight. Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) collectors use lenses or mirrors as optics to focus the sunlight onto the high-efficiency cells. The main idea is to use very little of the expensive semi-conducting PV material while collecting as much sunlight as possible with lower-cost concentrating optics. CPV systems are being considered primarily for utility-scale applications. CSP technologies use concentrating optics to generate high temperatures that are typically used to drive conventional steam or gas turbines. Due to economies of scale, CSP is generally considered a central-generation technology, rather than a source of distributed generation. The three main types of concentrating solar power systems are parabolic trough systems, power tower systems, and dish/engine systems. Variants of these systems are also being considered, such as the linear Fresnel reflector system, which uses flat, rather than parabolic, mirrors to concentrate the solar thermal energy. Parabolic trough systems concentrate the sun's energy through the use of long, linear parabolically curved mirrors. The mirrors track the sun, focusing sunlight on a receiver that runs along the focal line of the trough. A heat-transfer fluid, typically a synthetic oil, flows through the receiver, rising in temperature as it flows along the length of the collector. The hot oil is then used to boil water in a conventional steam generator to produce electricity. Alternatively, water can be boiled directly in the receiver using a direct-steam receiver. A key advantage of parabolic trough systems is that they can use thermal storage, giving the systems the flexibility to dispatch electricity coincident with peak utility loads, which often occur late in the evening. Many systems in Spain, as well as the system announced by Arizona Public Service last month, will make use of this feature. Parabolic trough systems are currently the most commercially developed technology. A power tower system uses a large field of mirrors, called heliostats, to concentrate sunlight onto the top of a tower, where a receiver is located. This focused sunlight heats a working fluid such as molten salt or water/steam flowing through the receiver. Similar to oil in a parabolic trough receiver, the salt in a tower receiver is used to generate steam (using heat exchangers) to generate electricity through a conventional steam generator. As with trough systems, tower systems can be integrated with thermal storage. Future low-cost storage options should allow both troughs and towers to operate competitively in the near-term in intermediate load markets and in the future in base load markets, offering a potential alternative to coal-based generation. A dish/engine system uses a mirrored dish, similar to a very large satellite dish. The dish-shaped surface collects and concentrates the sun's heat onto a receiver, which absorbs the heat and transfers it to a gas within a Stirling engine or gas turbine. The heat allows the gas to expand against a piston (in a Stirling engine) or to power a turbine to produce mechanical power. The mechanical power is then used to run a generator or alternator to produce electricity. Resource Potential for Solar Energy in the United States A study commissioned by the Western Governors' Association (WGA) looked at the solar resource and suitable land available in seven southwestern U.S. states, including California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) determined optimal CSP sites with high economic potential by excluding regions in urban or sensitive areas, regions with low solar resource, and regions where terrain would inhibit the cost- effective deployment of large-scale plants. Even with this high level of exclusions, the WGA solar task force calculated a capability of generating up to , gigawatts (GW) using CSP technologies--almost seven times the current electric generating capacity of the entire United States. The WGA study found that, with a build-out of only two to four GW of CSP, the technology will be competitive with conventional natural-gas-fired combined-cycle plants with a cost approaching cents per kilowatt-hour. The southwestern United States is not the only area with great potential for CSP. Projects are under way in Spain and Northern Africa, with additional projects planned for Israel, the Middle East, Northern Mexico, and Australia. In total, more than utility-scale CSP plants are under development worldwide, primarily driven by policies favorable to large-scale deployment of the technology. Two questions are now addressed that relate to the role of the Federal Government in the success of utility-scale solar projects in the Untied States. The first question is: How can the Federal Government facilitate the deployment of utility-scale solar projects? At the request of the U.S. Department of Energy, NREL analyzed the impact of policy (both State and federal) and R&D on the penetration of utility-scale solar generating systems in the southwest United States. The Renewable Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model, developed at NREL, was used to estimate the U.S. market potential of wind and solar energy for the next to years. The model competes these technologies against the more-conventional generation technologies of hydro, gas-combustion turbine and combined-cycle systems, coal, and nuclear. Future sequestration technologies are also included within the ReEDS model. Results from the model indicate that utility-scale solar technologies can produce nearly GWs of capacity in the Southwest by . Significantly more capacity is possible if dedicated transmission can supply generation to load centers located outside the Southwest. However, a key outcome of the analysis is that initial market penetration is extremely dependent on the continuation of the existing percent investment tax credit (ITC). According to the analysis, without an extension of the ITC, new capacity will be delayed about to years--until lower CSP generation costs resulting from R&D and international market development allow CSP technologies to compete against future conventional plants. The Federal Government can facilitate the deployment of solar power plants by providing access to land. Utility-scale solar projects require considerable acreage. The -megawatt (MW) Arizona Public Service project mentioned earlier will cover three square miles. That is nearly , acres to produce the power for , homes. The Federal Government owns large tracts of land in the West. Doing an environmental study of those lands and streamlining the process by which industry can lease tracts found suitable for solar power projects will shorten the time it will take to build projects on these lands. Finally, the Federal Government can support efforts to relieve transmission congestion throughout the West. Existing transmission lines are operating at near capacity. New lines must be built to bring power from solar plants located in the areas where the solar resource is best, often in remote sunny regions. Our transmission grid is like our highway system, but without the interstate highways. An ``interstate'' grid system would facilitate the transmission of solar power from the Southwest to load centers throughout the United States. As described earlier, the United States has an enormous solar resource. Once we reduce the cost of the technology, the next challenge will be to distribute the electricity produced to the people who need it. A second questions is: How does the level of federal investment required to ``kick start'' utility-scale solar compare with that required by other technologies seeking government support? NREL scientists are studying a number of renewable energy technologies. The country is entering a period where it must start making the transition to new sources of energy. DOE and NREL are pursuing a portfolio approach of technologies--such as solar, wind, biomass, hydrogen, and geothermal--that could play a role in the future. All these technologies have the potential to become cost competitive with fossil generation. The price tag of utility-scale solar projects is large. For example, the -MW plant mentioned above will cost more than a billion dollars. Fortunately, the Federal Government does not need to contribute directly to cover the cost of these plants. The southwestern states have established renewable portfolio standards that have created the market for utility-scale power plants. Some states have established price guidelines by which they recognize that they will initially have to pay more for the renewable power. The additional costs are passed along to the rate payers. Thus, the bulk of the cost for establishing cost-effective utility-scale solar power is being borne by the states. If the Federal Government were to decide that utility-scale solar power was important, then they could partner with the states, which have already kick-started utility-scale solar. Most of the money appropriated for solar energy R&D focuses on residential and commercial applications. Utility-scale solar receives about $ million out of a total solar budget of $ million. To meet the goals mentioned earlier, the DOE estimates that this funding would need to be doubled. Researchers at NREL work closely with the CSP industry and universities to develop new technologies that are more efficient and less costly. A study commissioned by DOE several years ago showed that reducing the cost of solar technology depends about percent on R&D and percent on actually building solar projects. This combination of R&D and deployment could well bring the cost of solar power into alignment with fossil generation in the intermediate power markets. And with low-cost storage, the overall cost may also align with future baseload power markets if carbon constraints are considered. Summary Addressing our near-term needs in solar power will require a national strategy that promotes the deployment of solar systems and processes that are ready to serve us today. At the same time, addressing our longer-term needs and achieving a significant contribution from solar power technologies will require a major new commitment to the research needed to deliver the next--and subsequent-- generations of CSP, PV. and other new solar technologies. Thank you.

Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Mehos. Mr. Hansen, please. STATEMENT OF MR. THOMAS N. HANSEN, VICE PRESIDENT, ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE ENERGY, TUCSON ELECTRIC POWER Mr. Hansen. Good afternoon, Chairwoman Giffords, thank you for the opportunity, thank you, distinguished Members of the Committee, for the opportunity to be here today to discuss with you what I consider a very important solution and a plausible solution to our energy challenges for the future, the ``Solar Grand Plan,'' as described in the ``Scientific American'' issue in January of . While many energy resources are sustainable and environmentally neutral, only solar energy can supply all of our projected energy needs for the long-term sufficient needs to meet our long-term needs in the United States for centuries to come. The January, issue of ``Scientific American Magazine'' details that ``Solar Grand Plan,'' and it could realistically provide percent of U.S. electric needs by , and percent of U.S. electric needs by the year . I should point out that my comments do not necessarily represent the views of Tucson Electric Power (TEP), although I'm employed by TEP these comments are based on my thoughts and my development of a totally alternative energy system over the last decade. So, TEP has not, at this point, taken a position on this ``Solar Grand Plan.'' The three core components of the ``Solar Grand Plan'' are first, solar energy installations, of course, to convert the sunlight into electricity. The second component, and a very important component, is energy storage. We need to be able to store that energy from the sunlight to make it dispatchable for periods when the sun is not shining. And finally, electric transmission, in order to bring the power from the southwest, or from other sources, be they hydro sources, or hydro kinetic, ocean sources, wind sources, throughout the United States, to the customers and to the energy storage sources. The ``Solar Grand Plan'' assumes the deployment of a combination of thin film photovoltaic technologies, about percent, and thermal storage, thermal solar technologies, including thermal storage, about percent. These technologies have a proven record of reliability and safety, and that is what I want to emphasize, the ``Solar Grand Plan'' uses proven technologies that are in existence today. They are a little more expensive than traditional technologies, but they are proven. They do work. The production of solar energy is a function of the time of day, time of year, and cloud cover. We need to have storage to be able to mitigate those intermittencies to provide utilities with a tool to make consistent dispatchable electricity. Solar energy has been developed, the modules themselves, the solar collectors of the thermal solar systems have been developed to a very high degree of reliability. What we need now is an effort to provide that storage, and to link the storage elements together with transmission opportunities. One great reason that we would propose using compressed air energy storage is because it is under ground. It uses the same technologies as have been used to develop natural gas storage, and, in fact, only uses about percent of the capacity that has been used already to develop natural gas storage in the United States. Energy storage under the ground makes it more secure, makes the opportunity to have it widely disbursed, providing better opportunities for energy security in the United States in the future. Finally, the transmission component. In order to tie everything together, to make the opportunity to move electricity, just as we have in the United States with our interstate highway system, we need to have an interstate transmission system. This will probably be, while it is, again, one of the more technically, easily implemented elements, it will be probably the most challenging element from the standpoint of regulations and the ability and need to work together with stakeholders from states, at the federal level, and local level, to be able to implement putting in these right-of-ways for transmission systems. There are other technologies as well that need to be developed. The smart grid technologies, as we heard, are a very important part. They make the glue, if you will, to tie all the pieces together. But, much, again, of that work has been done already. These are nascent technologies, but they do exist. They are not far fetched, this is not non-existent technology. With all energy project proposals there is a price. This program should take, we estimate, about $ billion, but think of it as another opportunity, another alternative, to carbon collection and storage. As we start looking at alternatives towards our energy future, we need to weigh the different alternatives. Carbon collection and storage is one opportunity, but so we feel is also the ``Solar Grand Plan.'' And finally, the ``Solar Grand Plan'' strengthens our energy security by effectively storing electrical energy under ground, just as we have done with fuels at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and at natural gas storage facilities. And, just as it took the political will of Congress, with strong support from the states, to make the interstate highway system a reality, so it will take strong leadership, vision and the will of Congress, in partnership with the states, to make this become a long-term, reliable, sustainable, energy secure solution for our nation. Madam Chair, I thank you for the opportunity to visit with you today, and I look forward in the future to questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hansen follows:] Prepared Statement of Thomas N. Hansen Thank you very much Chairman Lampson, Vice Chair Giffords, Ranking Member Inglis and distinguished Members of the Committee and staff. My name is Tom Hansen and I am the Vice President of Environmental Services, Conservation and Renewable Energy for Tucson Electric Power, the second largest investor-owned electric utility in Arizona. We serve the energy needs of nearly , customers in the Tucson area. It is always a great honor and pleasure to work with the Members of Congress and their staff in exploring solutions to the energy challenges facing Americans today. The production of affordable, safe electricity from sustainable and secure sources in an environmentally appropriate manner is one of those challenges. I am here today to discuss with you one plausible solution to that challenge--a Solar Grand Plan. My background includes the design, construction, operation or management of over , MW of generation capacity, comprised primarily of nuclear and coal power plants. Many of my solar advocate friends claim I am serving my penance for that background by working with solar energy. But I am proud to have played a role in developing the electric generation infrastructure that has served our society so well for many decades and will play a significant role in providing needed electricity for at least the next twenty years. Moreover, my background in the development of those traditional electric generation assets has given me a unique insight into the technical and operational characteristics of the next generation of power producing technologies. While many energy resources are sustainable and environmentally neutral, only solar energy can supply all of our projected energy needs for the long-term future. Solar energy is abundant, ubiquitous, sustainable and sufficient to meet the total energy needs of the United States for centuries in the future. The January issue of Scientific American detailed a ``Solar Grand Plan'' that could realistically meet percent of U.S. electric needs by while reducing electricity related greenhouse gas releases by nearly percent. The same plan could satisfy percent of our nation's electric needs by . I am here today to discuss that plan with the Committee. My enthusiasm for the Solar Grand Plan will likely become obvious throughout the course of this testimony. Nevertheless, I should point out that my comments do not necessarily represent the views of Tucson Electric Power. TEP has earned widespread recognition for its innovative solar power programs, and the company is committed to expanding its use of renewable power resources. But TEP has not taken a position on this particular plan for solar power development. The Solar Grand Plan incorporates three core technologies that will be coordinated through smart grid technologies. The smart grid, which will be discussed in more detail later, would be a bi-directional quasi-real time communications and control system with interconnected energy sources, including traditional, wind, tidal, hydrokinetic, biomass and geothermal. It would connect with consumer electric devices--including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles--and incorporate predictive solar and wind forecasts of both short-and long-term time spans. While this system is incorporated in the Solar Grand Plan, the technology has enough flexibility to seamlessly integrate any traditional fueled or sustainable energy resource. The three core components of the Solar Grand plan are: Solar generation to refine the energy in the light rays of the sun into electricity. Energy storage to preserve energy from the sun or any other power source for later conversion into electricity. Electric transmission to link the solar generation and energy storage to consumers and their equipment. Discussion of each core component follows: Solar Generation: The solar generation component converts the energy of the sun's rays into the electric energy that will be stored or delivered to customers. Any of a wide variety of existing solar energy technologies will meet the requirements for this component of the Solar Grand Plan, as the final output of all solar electric technologies is effectively interchangeable. Fixed or tracking flat plate, crystalline or thin film photovoltaic (PV) modules with DC-to-AC inverters for interconnection to the electric grid are supported. Concentrating solar power (CSP) using trough, solar tower, dish/thermal engine, dish/PV engine or concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) technologies are all supported. Tucson Electric Power's solar development experience has demonstrated that deployment of a varied portfolio of solar technologies is needed for optimal solar generation economics, as each solar technology type is best suited for operation in a particular set of climatic conditions. For example: PV, which uses virtually no water in operation, is best suited to a geographic area with no access to water; solar trough technology, meanwhile, is appropriate for areas with readily available water and can be combined with desalination options to augment the local potable water supply. The Solar Grand Plan assumes the deployment of a combination of thin-film PV technologies ( percent of the total) and solar thermal with storage technologies ( percent of the total). Both technologies are commercially available and are in common use today, with a very good opportunity for future cost reductions. The solar generation technologies envisioned in the Solar Grand Plan have a proven record of reliability and safety. Future challenges for these technologies include reducing their cost through development of larger-scale U.S. located manufacturing facilities, optimizing the balance of system component costs and standardizing installation code requirements. Solutions to these challenges include an extension of the federal Investment Tax Credit for solar energy systems, expanded support for research and development of new solar energy conversion technologies at federal laboratories and universities, continued support for the Solar America Initiative program goals, and expanded federal programs for education and outreach to the American people regarding developments in solar energy product commercialization. Energy Storage: A core concept of the Solar Grand Plan is the need to store solar energy for use when the sun is not shining. By way of explanation, traditional electric generation is performed by technology that effectively refines a form of primary energy such as chemical energy in coal or nuclear energy in uranium into electricity. Instantaneous customer demand for electricity is met through the conversion of just the right amount of primary energy source to perfectly balance the supply of electrons with demand for those electrons at all times. A utility's ability to meet its customers' peak electric demand is a function of the maximum capacity built into the power plant. Production of solar energy--effectively refining the energy of the sun into electricity--is a function of time of day, time of year and cloud cover as well as capacity of the plant. The energy of the sun at the Earth's surface is not dispatchable, to use a traditional electric system term, as the utility has no direct control over increasing the sun's intensity. The addition of cost- effective, reliable, efficient, safe, environmentally compatible energy storage into a solar generation system would allow a utility to control output to support customer loads during times when the sun's energy is not available. Energy storage is needed on at least two different time scales: storing excess solar energy in one season for consumption a season or two later, and storage of daytime solar output for use at night. Numerous energy storage technologies exist today, but only two are suitable for utility scale use. One of them, pumped hydro storage, retains energy in the form of potential energy in water stored at a high elevation. The energy is released when the water is allowed to flow to a lower elevation through a traditional hydro generator. The other option, compressed air energy storage (CAES), retains potential energy in the form of high-pressure gas in an underground cavern or pore structure. While pumped hydro requires a specific set of geographic surface features and a supply of water, the underground conditions that would allow CAES are available in nearly every state in the union and often are used today for natural gas storage. The same technologies used for developing natural gas storage would support CAES development. The compressors that would tap excess solar generation to pump air underground are available today, as are the combustors and expansion turbines needed to convert the energy in compressed air to electricity. Such generators effectively would employ a split-shaft combustion turbine, thus relying on the same technology used to generate power from fossil fuels today. Two CAES plants are operational today with decades of operating experience, and other plants are in development for use in balancing the output of wind generation. The Solar Grand Plan requires a total underground storage volume of less than percent of the volume used today for storage of natural gas, a very feasible amount of underground development using existing technology. Surface disturbance area for CAES is very similar to that of natural gas storage, with an additional need for electric transmission access. Energy storage cycle efficiencies of CAES are around percent using existing technologies. While existing CAES technologies use some natural gas to reheat the air prior to conversion of the stored energy back to electricity, adiabatic expansion turbines can be developed that will not require the use of natural gas during energy recovery. A comparison of CAES characteristics with those of other energy storage technologies typically associated with solar energy, such as batteries or flywheels, is very favorable for CAES. Existing battery technologies typically can support a limited number of storage cycle before they must be replaced. Meanwhile, storage of energy from one season to another in batteries or flywheels generally results in additional storage cycle losses dependent upon the duration. CAES can store energy with minimal loss for extended time periods, and capacity does not degrade with an increasing number of charge/discharge cycles. Meeting all of the Nation's electric needs with solar power would require a sizable volume of energy storage to manage the seasonal and daily variations of solar energy production. While this storage could involve pumped hydro, flywheels, super-capacitors or superconductive magnetic energy storage (SMES), CAES enjoys a significant advantage in that it relies on deep underground facilities. This reduces its impact on land use, limits direct human interaction with the stored energy and mitigates risk from attack by enemies of our country. While the Solar Grand Plan can use any type of efficient, low-cost energy storage system, CAES was chosen due to its existing commercial availability, relatively low cost and proven reliability in utility scale applications. Thermal energy storage in molten salts, a relatively new technology incorporated in plans for thermal solar generation plants, could become part of the Solar Grand Plan's short-term storage component if its reliability and cost effectiveness prove comparable to those of CAES. Again, the Solar Grand Plan has sufficient flexibility to accommodate any new storage technology that can improve upon the reliability, efficiency, low environmental impact and cost effectiveness of CAES. Development of the energy storage system could be supported by federal Investment Tax Credits to reduce the effective initial cost to the owner of an energy storage facility; supportive capacity tariff rates from regional transmission organizations; and continued support of energy storage technology research and development, including additional funding for evaluation of geologic potential for CAES throughout the United States through the National Laboratories and universities. Favorable regulatory policy ensuring that the requirements of permitting a CAES facility are no more complex than permitting natural gas storage also would help reduce obstacles to development of the energy storage needed for the Solar Grand Plan. Transmission: The Solar Grand Plan includes a transmission component to collect and distribute the energy produced at the solar generation sites to the energy storage component and to energy-consuming customers throughout the Nation. The Solar Grand Plan does not specifically mention support for wind, biomass, hydro, tidal, current and other forms of sustainable energy production. Nevertheless, it would provide a national transmission backbone--similar in nature, if not in scope, to the National Interstate Highway system--capable of carrying energy from any generation source. The use of high-voltage DC lines for the Solar Grand Plan would leverage proven technologies to significantly reduce the risk of technical problems. However, the development of a national electricity backbone to enable the delivery of energy produced anywhere in the U.S. to any other part of the country will require the same sort of sustained political will that supported the -year effort to complete the Interstate Highway System. Policy development will need to address the concerns of property owners, regional and State development priorities and special interests. We must seek to forge a coordinated set of transmission development incentives that will ensure the full acquisition of the right-of-way required for completion of the transmission backbone in a timely manner. Funding will be needed for research analysis and development of the specific right-of-way alignment for the transmission backbone system. Strategic ``off-ramp'' locations for interconnection to existing regional and local transmission systems will need to be determined through extensive review and analysis of existing available transmission capacity. Cost-effective solutions for transmission bottlenecks to ensure efficient transfer of energy throughout the Nation will need to be found through additional analysis by National Laboratories and universities in cooperation with regional transmission organizations and electric utilities. All of the high-voltage DC transmission technology exists now to make the transmission backbone a reality. Nevertheless, development of a national electric transmission backbone will be the most difficult component of the Solar Grand Plan to implement because of the need to resolve a myriad of permitting and regulatory issues. Additionally, rules to allocate the system's costs to regions and various customer groups will have to be finalized prior to implementation of the transmission backbone. Technical advancements in high-temperature superconductors could make the regulatory challenges easier to resolve by providing an option for burying the transmission system underground in congested areas where overhead line extensions could be unacceptable. Federal Investment Tax Credits for companies investing in the transmission backbone would offer financial incentives for attracting investment in the transmission backbone system. Smart Grid: To maximize performance under the Solar Grand Plan, there is a need for a communications and control system to coordinate the solar generation, energy storage and transmission components. These so- called ``Smart Grid'' technologies include: advanced metering, meter database automation, quasi-real time bi-directional communications between customers and producers, direct load control, central distributed generation control and intelligent appliances. Customers will increasingly play a larger role in addressing the challenges of our energy future. Smart Grid technologies provide both customers and utilities with the tools to better manage the production, storage, delivery and use of electricity. In so doing, the Smart Grid changes the basic premise of electricity providers, transforming utilities from providers of am energy commodity to enablers of energy transactions. Under such circumstances, regulations to decouple commodity energy supply from utility revenue recovery will be an integral part of the development of the Solar Grand Plan. Innovative rate incentives could be developed to make effective use of a nationwide Smart Grid. For example, owners of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in New Jersey might be convinced to lend use of their cars' batteries to store solar energy produced in Arizona. Continued support of the National Laboratories for development and testing of Smart Grid technologies and development of transaction manager grid control algorithms will enable the Solar Grand Plan technologies to become reality. Other Considerations: The Solar Grand Plan requires the commitment of fairly large tracts of land for the installation of solar generation, energy storage and transmission. Transmission and CAES storage facilities would be spread out across the country, mitigating their environmental impact on any particular region. However, the solar generation component is expected to be concentrated in the southwestern U.S. to tap promising solar energy resources in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and California. This could create concerns about the environmental impact of large sections of land being effectively covered with solar collectors. Placing a large percentage of our nation's solar generation assets in one geographic area also makes them more susceptible to damage from a single weather related event. Distributing solar generation systems over a wider area may reduce that risk of damage. Funding should be made available for evaluation of optimum solar generation area coverage factors, heat island creation, environmental mitigation, wildlife habitat impacts and beneficial land uses in harmony with solar collectors. We also would need to consider the societal impact of bringing a significant number of solar equipment installers to live and work in currently uninhabited areas of the desert southwest. While the Solar Grand Plan envisions that most of our sustainable energy resources will be solar, the system would accommodate any generation resource--including our existing coal and gas fired power plants and nuclear facilities. As we transition to a new solar-based energy infrastructure, we must make accommodations for linking these existing resources into the national transmission backbone and incorporating their output into our energy storage plans. Financial Support: As with all energy project proposals, the Solar Grand Plan has a price. An estimated subsidy of $ billion would be needed to support development of plan components from to . After , the plan should be financially self-supporting as the cost of solar power with storage drops below the price of energy that could be generated from proposed traditional power plants. At that time, the Solar Grand Plan infrastructure would provide an economic alternative to construction of those new plants, and funds for continued expansion of the system would come from the sources traditionally used for new power plants today. A commitment to fund the solar generation portion of the Solar Grand Plan would encourage solar manufacturers to invest in new production factories in the United States. We will not fully reap the economic benefits of solar power development or achieve national energy security until the manufacturing of our basic energy Solar Grand Plan components occurs within this country. We will also not take full advantage of reducing our energy related expenses overseas if we are purchasing solar products produced in other nations. Conclusion: The Solar Grand Plan is proposed to demonstrate that there is at least one feasible, affordable, realistic plan based on proven existing technologies that can transition our fossil and nuclear energy based electric energy production infrastructure into a sustainable energy production infrastructure. It is instructive that the Interstate Highway System had an initial cost of $ billion in dollars, very close to the $ billion of subsidies that would be needed to bring the Solar Grand Plan into reality. The Solar Grand Plan strengthens our energy security by effectively storing electrical energy underground, as we have done with fuels at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and at natural gas storage facilities. Energy security is further enhanced by geographic dispersion of the energy storage facilities and through redundancy in the transmission backbone right-of-way alignments. Just as the construction materials and route alignments evolved during the -year construction of the Interstate Highway System, the Solar Grand Plan will benefit from advancements in technology and regulations during its development. And just as it took the political will of Congress with strong support from the states to make the Interstate Highway System a reality, strong leadership, vision and the will of Congress in partnership with the states will be essential to implementing a long-term, reliable, sustainable, secure energy solution for our nation. Chairman Lampson, Vice Chair Giffords, Ranking Member Inglis and distinguished Members of the Committee and staff, I want to thank your for this opportunity to address the Solar Grand Plan and for your dedication to finding solutions to the energy challenges facing our future.

KATE MARACAS, VICE PRESIDENT, ARIZONA OPERATIONS, ABENGOA SOLAR INC. Ms. Maracas. Thank you. Chairwoman Giffords, Members of the Committee, and staff, I, too, would like to express my appreciation for the opportunity to talk about this very important subject today. Thank you. I am the Vice President of Arizona Operations for Abengoa Solar, and we are a very large company based in Madrid, Spain. Abengoa employs over , people worldwide, and we have presence in more than countries. Right now, we have about people in the U.S. and Spain, who are dedicated to improving the technology and developing solar technology in the sunny southwestern states. In December of , last year, the U.S. Department of Energy selected us for three R&D projects aimed at improving solar parabolic trough technology, which you saw in Mr. Mehos' presentation. And recently, as we have already talked a little bit about, we have announced an agreement with Arizona Public Service to build, own and operate the megawatt CSP, or concentrating solar plant called Solana. APS will purchase all of the output of the plant, and I think as Congressman Mitchell already mentioned, if the plant were in operation today it would be the very largest in the world. So, with over megawatts of large-scale solar power plants in operation, development and construction in the U.S., Spain, Algeria, and Morocco, I think our company is notably one of the largest providers, leading providers of large-scale solar technology today. And, with that position in mind, we are grateful to be part of this important dialogue and discussing the role that CSP and other large-scale solar technologies can play in helping build our nation's energy resource portfolio. We will also be talking about the opportunities for removal of obstacles or barriers that could get in our way, and could otherwise prevent us from leveraging this very abundant resource, which as we heard comes in buckets from the sky. I like that analogy, I think it is a good one. I have been asked to address a few topics today, and they include, one, the efficacy of large-scale solar power as a significant component of the U.S. generation fleet, and barrier reduction opportunities for achieving this potential. Two, the near and long-term economic impacts of large-scale solar deployment. And third, the role of government in advancing solar thermal technologies. In the interest of time and efficiency, I will probably skip the third one, because I really cannot add anything to what Mr. Mehos has already commented, and I certainly concur with his remarks. On the subject of large-scale solar generation as a viable option for providing significant contributions to our power needs, my view is, certainly, that large-scale power facilities not only have the potential to become a leading part of our national resource portfolio, they are also among the smartest options that we can exercise, particularly, in a business-wise context. Further, I see today's family of CSP technologies as an important mainstream option for utility resource plans, and I will explain the reasons for those thoughts momentarily. Just one minute I will spend, before I get there, though, on the distinction in technologies. Mr. Mehos already pointed out some of the few, but the family of solar and thermal CSP technologies is growing rapidly and there is an increasing number of technologies that are becoming part of the solar thermal or CSP family. These technologies are advancing rapidly in the marketplace, but there are two basic categories of technology that I would like to distinguish. One is the category of photovoltaic or PV technologies, and those are the technologies that convert the sun's energy directly into electricity by virtue of a photo electric reaction that occurs on a semiconducting material. And, when a concentrating mechanism such as a lens is used on conjunction with those PV cells then we have a large-scale technology known as high concentration photovoltaics or ACPV, and this becomes a member of the utility-scale solar family, as I mentioned earlier, and you saw an illustration of one of those technologies on Mr. Mehos' slide. But, the solar thermal category, which is kind of the work horse of the large-scale family, is a bit different, in that it uses the sun's heat to produce steam, which in turn becomes the working agent in a conventional ranking cycle, the very familiar thermodynamic process that converts heat to energy in a common steam plant. So, this is very familiar, tried and true, mature technology. The significant difference between our kind of solar steam plant and natural goal or coal steam plants is that there is no fossil fuel combustion or associated carbon emission to use in creating the mechanical energy that in turn spins the turbine, and then transfers mechanical energy to an electric generator. So, most of my remarks today are with the large-scale solar technologies in mind. And then, returning to my comment that CSP is a business- wise decision, I can offer that at Abengoa Solar we talk with many, many utilities in our sunny southwestern and western states, and they are beginning to articulate large-scale solar in a different way. It is no longer just something that we have to do for compliance anymore. It is no longer something that our utility colleagues talk about as an R&D endeavor or an experiment, it is something that they consider a wise part of the their future resource planning options. When we talk about advanced coal technologies, which are not terribly mature yet today, and what are the other options that could compete as we are thinking about rapidly-growing demand in service areas, you probably will hear from Ms. Lockwood today about the rapid growth that APS is experiencing in our state. When you look at natural gas volatility risks, and the increasing likelihood of some kind of carbon regulation or carbon tax, then utilities are really beginning to think of it differently. Although, as Tom says, everything has a price, there is a slight premium today above conventional generation costs for CSP or large-scale solar generated electricity, but that cost gap is closing and I think Mark's slides illustrated that very well. As natural gas prices rise, as other costs go up, and as carbon regulation becomes more imminent the gap is closing. Our costs will come down. Utilities are increasingly viewing CSP as a wise bet against fuel price volatility and open-ended carbon liability. APS, our first large-scale CSP customer in the U.S., has, in fact, been very, very forward thinking about the role that CSP will play in their future resource portfolio, and I will let Barbara talk about that in just a little bit. But, I will say that APS has really been a leader among a group of very proactive utilities who are thinking about this in a very different way today. And, the final portion of this first topic that I have been asked to address relates to those barriers that could stand in the way of large-scale solar deployment, and I will just be very simplistic about this. In my mind, there is no barrier whatsoever related to technology. Yes, indeed, there is room for improvements in cost, and performance, and efficiency, and R&D should continue, but in terms of will technology be the barrier that prevents us from going forward, it most definitely will not. In my view, the greatest barrier to increased deployment of solar generating facilities is, indeed, political rather technical, and you know where I am going with this, I am going to be talking about the ITC, the lack of an enduring tax credit, the percent solar investment tax credits that we have talked about briefly already, is really the biggest hindrance that we see today in large-scale solar. The ITC has been in place since the passage of the Energy Policy Act in , but it has, since its enactment it has really just been kept on life support with one or two-year extensions at a time. As Mark said, these one or two-year extensions do large- scale projects really no good, in fact, they do a disservice, because it prevents us from developing a longer extension through Congress that could help create the certainties that capital markets need to lend money on these large projects. The duration of one or two years, which is shorter than the project development time for a large-scale solar plant, means that we really must see a long-term extension, at least eight years of the ITC, in order for this industry to move forward. As Congressman Mitchell mentioned, we have been very candid about the fact that the Solana Generating Station in the Gila Bend area of Arizona cannot happen without it, without the eight-year extension. So, for these reasons I guess I will just say, ITC, ITC, ITC over and over again, and I would urge Congress to extend this important measure for an eight-year period, through bipartisan support of the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of which passed through the House last month. On the subject of near and long-term economic impacts of large-scale solar deployment, I can draw observations from a very large body of credible research that has been done over the last several years on this topic, and I will speak as a member of the Western Governors' Solar Task Force--or the Western Governors' Association Solar Task Force, as a member of that group I participated in a comprehensive effort to analyze the role that solar energy could play in helping the Governors meet an ambitious goal of deploying , megawatts of clean energy in their states by . So, our task was to understand what is the actual resource potential, what is the market potential, how does that match up with demand for energy, what is the industry's capability to gear up and build projects and deliver energy through solar resources, and also to understand the barriers to deployment, and then finally, what will this effort pay back in terms of economic benefits. On the topic of economic impact, we examined over a dozen economic studies that had been done since , all by credible investigators, State governments, national labs, universities. In fact, three of those studies were supported by Mark's institution, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and these three looked specifically at CSP, Concentrating Solar Power plants, and in a variety of different scenarios and assumptions about different growth patterns, and sizes of deployments and so on, they looked at what would be the impacts in terms of private investment in the state, permanent and temporary job creation, indirect and direct effects, and so on. And, we convened--these studies were conducted for Nevada, for New Mexico, and for southern California, and so the assumptions were all different, as I mentioned, different sizes of economies, and different scales and so on, in order to just understand, in a general sense, what does CSP or large-scale solar deployment really mean, in terms of just kind of generalization across the board, what does one gigawatt, , megawatts of CSP actually do to our economies. So, we convened an expert panel of economists to generalize these impacts, and our findings were that for every gigawatt of CSP added to the state's economy the deployment would yield $ to $ billion of private investment in the state, , to , construction jobs, and up to permanent solar plant jobs, many of those in rural areas where we typically are trying to attract economic development, a $ . to $ . billion, -year increase in tax revenues, and that is after any tax incentives or other incentives are given to the project developers, and between $ and $ billion in increased gross State product. And so, a general rule of thumb for one gigawatt of CSP. These are enormous positive impacts that can occur. Clearly, the findings indicated that the broader incorporation of large-scale solar plants into the U.S. generation fleet, not only produces those economic impacts, but also the benefits of sustainability and energy independence, as Mr. Hansen spoke about. Finally, on the role of government advancing solar technologies, as I said, I will defer. I think those points have already been made very well. I will say that the thing that government can do for this technology, in addition to what Mr. Mehos mentioned, and issues that will help us site and facilitate permitting, solve transmission congestion problems and so on, we have to help CSP learn to walk on its own, and, in fact, we very much hope it learns to run. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Maracas follows:] Prepared Statement of Kate Maracas Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Giffords, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am the Vice President of Arizona Operations for Abengoa Solar Inc., a U.S. division of Abengoa, which is based in Madrid, Spain. Abengoa employs over , people worldwide, with presence in more than countries. Abengoa Solar has a team of approximately people in the United States and Spain dedicated to researching, developing and improving solar technologies. In December , the U.S. Department of Energy selected Abengoa Solar for three research and development projects to improve solar parabolic trough technology. And recently, we announced an agreement with Arizona Public Service to build, own and operate a Megawatt (MW) Concentrating Solar Power, or ``CSP'' plant in western Arizona. APS will purchase all of the output of the plant, known as the Solana Generating Station. If in operation today, Solana would be the largest solar power plant in the world. With over MW of large-scale solar power plants in operation, development, and construction stages in the U.S., Spain, Morocco, and Algeria, Abengoa Solar is notably one of the world's leading providers of large-scale solar technology solutions today. With that position in mind, we are especially grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this important dialogue about the role that CSP and other large scale solar technologies can play in our nation's energy resource portfolio, and the opportunities for removing obstacles that could prevent us from leveraging our very abundant and sustainable solar resource. I have been asked to address a few topics today, and they include: ( ) The efficacy of large-scale solar power as a significant component of the U.S. generation fleet, and barrier reduction opportunities for achieving this potential; ( ) Near- and long-term economic impacts of large-scale solar deployments; and ( ) The role of government in advancing solar thermal technologies. I will attempt to address these topics, in that same order. On the subject of large-scale solar generation as a viable option for providing significant contributions to our nation's power needs, my view is that large-scale solar power facilities not only have the potential to become a meaningful part of our national resource portfolio; they are also among the smartest options we can exercise-- particularly in a business-wise context. Further, I see today's family of CSP technologies as an important ``mainstream'' option for utility resource plans. I will explain the reasons for those thoughts momentarily, and before I do, a brief discussion about the distinction between large-scale solar generation and CSP in particular is worthwhile. The family of solar thermal and CSP technologies is growing rapidly. An increasing number of technology approaches to solar thermal generation is advancing in the market place. I would like to clarify that there are two very basic categories of solar electricity generation. One is the category of photovoltaic, or ``PV'' technologies--those that convert the sun's energy directly to electricity by virtue of a photo-electric reaction that occurs on a semi-conducting material. When a concentrating mechanism such as a lens is used in conjunction with PV cells, the technology is known as High Concentration Photovoltaics, or ``HCPV.'' Because the lenses add great efficiency to the PV cells' production capacity, HCPV is currently being developed as a utility-scale solar option. The solar thermal category is a bit different, in that it uses the sun's heat to produce steam, which in turn becomes the working agent in a conventional Rankine Cycle--the very familiar thermodynamic process that converts heat to energy in a common steam power plant. The significant difference is that a solar thermal plant requires no fossil fuel combustion or associated carbon emissions to create the mechanical energy that spins a turbine, which in turn transfers mechanical energy to an electric generator. Most of my remarks today contemplate thermal CSP technologies, although Abengoa Solar also views HCPV as a very promising technology in the near horizon. Returning to my comment that CSP is a ``business-wise'' decision, I can offer that Abengoa Solar Inc. holds discussions with many utilities in our sunny western and southwestern states, and an increasing number of our utility contacts articulate that they no longer view CSP as just an option for Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) compliance, or as an experimental R&D endeavor. Rather, our utility colleagues consider their future resource planning options in the context of advanced coal technology and emission constraints, natural gas price volatility risks, and the increasing likelihood of carbon emission costs in the form of externalities or direct taxation. Although there is a slight premium today above conventional generation costs for CSP-generated electricity, the cost gap is closing as fossil fuel prices increase and carbon regulation becomes more imminent. With today's promise of dispatchable solar plants made available through advanced commercialization of Solar Thermal Energy Storage (TES) technology, utilities increasingly view CSP as a wise bet against fuel price volatility and open-ended carbon liability. Arizona Public Service, our first large-scale CSP customer in the U.S., has in fact been very forward thinking about the role of CSP in their future resource portfolio. APS is a leader among a group of proactive utilities in our nation who very definitely view CSP as a viable part of a low-risk resource portfolio, and as a mainstream element of their growing generation fleet. The final portion of this topic that I have been asked to address relates to those barriers that may stand in the way of large-scale solar deployments. There is no question in my mind that technology is not a barrier. While there is room for cost and performance improvements that will occur with technology advancements, economies of scale, repetition and associated learning curve improvements, the greatest barrier to increased deployment of solar generating facilities is indeed political rather than technical. While federal support of R&D must continue, the single most significant hindrance to broader deployments of CSP facilities in the U.S. is the lack of an enduring tax credit which is essential to the financial viability of CSP installations today. The percent federal Investment Tax Credit, or ``ITC,'' has been in place since passage of the Energy Policy Act . But since its enactment it has been kept on life support with one- or two-year reauthorizations at a time. The short lifespan of the ITC does not stimulate the deployment of large, capital-intense solar generating stations, which require three to four years to build. Further, the large institutional entities required to provide construction and operating capital for these projects cannot operate with the uncertainty of an expiring tax credit whose duration is shorter than a project development period. In summary, are there technology improvements to be achieved for large-scale solar through R&D? Absolutely. Are the barriers to meeting more of our nation's energy needs through solar energy production related to technology? Absolutely not. The single most important barrier to achieving our solar potential is the lack of a policy framework that is sufficiently robust to stimulate solar deployments in a meaningful way. We, our industry colleagues, and our consumers urge Congress to extend the federal ITC for an eight year period through bipartisan support of the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of that passed in the House last month. On the subject of near- and long-term economic impacts of large- scale solar deployments, I can draw observations from a large body of credible research that has been done over the last several years. As a member of the Western Governors Association's Solar Task Force, I participated in a comprehensive effort to analyze the role that solar energy could play in helping the Governors meet their goal of deploying , MW of clean energy in their states by the year . Our task was to understand the resource potential, the market potential, the industry's capacity, the barriers to deployment, and the economic impacts that would result. On the latter topic, we examined over a dozen economic studies conducted since by credible investigators such as universities, national laboratories, and State governments. In fact, three of those studies, supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) examined the economic impacts that could be expected as a result of increased deployment of CSP plants in particular. The studies contemplated a variety of CSP plant growth and scale scenarios, and the changes to be expected in terms of job creation, net Treasury gains, Gross State Product, and private investment. We convened an expert panel of economists to generalize these impacts across different State economies, and across different assumptions used among the studies. Our findings were that for every one Gigawatt (GW) of CSP added to a state's economy, the deployment would yield:\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ The assumptions here are: GA state economy (GSP) of $ B (a median range --------------------------------------------------------------------------- across states); GOnly direct jobs--no manufacturing or other indirect jobs are considered here; GInvestment represents only direct capital associated with the plant and assets; GGSP increase includes indirect and induced effects. $ -$ billion private investment in state; , - , construction jobs; up to permanent solar plant jobs, many in rural areas; $ . -$ . billion -yr. increase in State tax revenues; and $ -$ billion increase in Gross State Product. Those figures represent net effects, even after any tax credits or economic incentives are utilized to stimulate industry development. Clearly, the findings show that broader incorporation of large-scale solar plants into the U.S. generation fleet not only produces the benefits of sustainability and energy independence, it also pays back in very significant, positive economic impacts. Finally, on the role of government in advancing solar thermal technologies, it is clear that the private sector cannot achieve a ``Grand Solar Plan'' alone. The market penetration of any new technology, product, or service traditionally follows a pattern of growth in market adoption, followed by declining prices and higher margins that result from economies of scale. Large-scale solar generation is no different in that regard. What is different, however, is that the capital commitments required to bring large-scale solar plants to market are very large, and the risk of investing in such markets with the hope that demand will follow is too high for private sector entities to bear alone. This condition describes the very traditional role that government has played in numerous examples of infrastructure development and market stimulation actions. The government's role in solar power thus far has been both push and pull. By that I imply that the creation of demand for clean solar energy in the market place must come from both mandates and incentives. Twenty six states, including Arizona, now have Renewable Portfolio Standards that require increasing portions of delivered electricity to be derived from renewable energy resources. The RPS frameworks are a very good start, but only speak to half of the push-pull equation. Governments must also step up to the plate to incentivize market activity, and so I repeat here that a vitally important role for the Federal Government will be to extend the ITC for eight years so that large solar power plants can be financed and be economically viable. Recalling my comparison to other new technologies, products, and services in the marketplace, CSP will also grow up and learn to walk on its own. On a final note, I will comment that we are very pleased to see the serious commitment to solar energy R&D that both the President and Congress have demonstrated in recent years. While I noted earlier that technology itself is not a barrier to large-scale solar power production, the efficiency and performance improvements that will be accomplished through R&D will continue to be an important part of ongoing cost reductions that will help large-scale solar generation to walk on its own. In fact, we hope it learns to run. Thank you very much for the opportunity to share our perspective on this important topic.

Thank you, Ms. Maracas. Ms. Rauluk, please. STATEMENT OF MS. VALERIE RAULUK, FOUNDER AND CEO, VENTURE CATALYST INC. Ms. Rauluk. Thank you, Madam Chair, Chairman Gordon, and distinguished Members of the Committee, Representatives Lipinski, Matheson, Mitchell, and Ranking Minority Leader Hall. I would also like to thank my colleagues regarding the insights I will share with you. Please note that Venture Catalyst is solely responsible for the opinions expressed. Thanks to Arizona Research Institute for Solar Energy, AzRISE, the University of Arizona, Joe Simmons and Ardeth Barnhardt, my colleagues at Sun Edison, Jigar Shah, Howard Green, Colin Murchie, and my colleagues at Raytheon Missile Systems, John Waszczak and Thomas Olden. Venture Catalyst has been engaged in commercialization of solar energy technology for the last ten years, primarily, under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, Sandia National Labs, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We have also worked with regional and national solar energy companies in thermal and photovoltaic technologies, from residential to utility-scale markets. Although fundamentally agnostic when it comes to solar technologies, I will address specific preferences based on risk factors and maximized benefits. Here is what I hope to cover, opportunities, obstacles, critical factors in the first years. The ``Grand Solar Plan'' is possible with the right investment structure and technology portfolio. The path to progress for achieving that goal is a going-forward focus on Distributed Solar Photovoltaic, DGPV, I hope to use that, DGPV, throughout here. Given the dominance of PV in the ``Grand Solar Plan'' and the , megawatts of solar thermal projects in the pipeline, a similar commitment to PV should be made. At present, megawatts of PV have been cumulatively developed. But most importantly, the DGPV focus offers the greatest flexibility for resolving the biggest obstacle to achieving the plan financing. Strategically targeted DGPV development offers all of the investor groups the best return on their investment, especially, the rate payers, and I am going to talk about that in a little more detail in a minute. A couple critical factors for success on the path to progress. First of all, productively framing the concept of utility-scale solar. The second, continuing technical improvements, and third, structuring the investment for fairness and maximized benefit. I want to talk a little bit about the different technologies and the different formats. You have already seen the difference between PV and solar thermal, I want to go into that. There is two major development formats for solar energy. One is the central station format, and the other is the distributed format. This is an example of solar thermal projects, which because of economies of scale limitations are to date developed in large-scale central station format. The title of this image is ``Perfection.'' This is one of the many formats that solar photovoltaic projects can take, a utility-scale project in a distributed generation DG format. It does not require transmission and the associated costs considered connected to the distribution part of the electric power grid. Strategically located PV installations within the distribution grid can provide benefits above and beyond the value of clean green peak power, benefits that can extend the life of power infrastructure and increase the reliability of the local grid. This is another picture of that same installation of an . megawatt in southern Colorado, and you can see the substation in the background there. Here is another way to deploy DGPV, and it has actually been the major development mode for PV to date, and that is roof-top installation. I would like to offer the following definition of utility- scale solar energy and call out the key factors, large scale, lower cost, higher reliability, and benefits across customer classes. Here are a couple examples, two to megawatt solar farms strategically located in the low pockets, one to five megawatt solar farms on the roof tops of schools, reducing school energy expenditures, and putting solar energy into the grid in the summertime for the rest of the community, and also, of course, the one to five megawatts in commercial government installations, similar to what I showed you before. Critical factor , solar energy technology is ready right now. You have heard that from several of the speakers. PV, in particular, has, and continues to achieve, incremental improvements across the entire value chain. Additionally, major advances are coming out of Arizona laboratories in the next three to -year term, specifically, in the area of PV, concentrated PV, or CPV, and high-concentrated PV, or HCPV. A solar focus on the PV family of technologies will help harvest additional economic benefits for Arizona and Arizona rate payers, and you will have to pardon my specific interest in Arizona. A major obstacle to PV deployment has been the conflict with preserving utility revenues. By means of both product design and regulatory rules and policy, the industry is actively addressing this conflict. A commitment to large-scale DGPV programs would accelerate the resolution. Financing, financing, as I have said, is a major obstacle to making this happen. We are asking the Federal Government, and local government, private capital, and, most importantly, the rate payers, from whence the utility renewable energy investment dollars comes from, are all the people involved in this transaction. We are asking rate payers, I think this is the most important thing that you need to think about as we structure this, we are asking rate payers to contribute to solar energy investment at the same time they are being asked to pay for fossil fuel increases. By developing many solar projects across numerous communities, more rate payers will experience the direct benefits of economic development and increased power security and reliability. PV, CPV, HCPV, because of greater scalability, flexibility, and modularity, can be deployed more easily across a range of situations. Regulatory obstacles, we know what has to be done, and have developed and implemented best practices in key regional U.S. markets. We need to nationalize those practices for a more rational and effective market. I would concur with many of the things that people have said already, the ITC is very important, and nationalizing some of these best practices is very important as well. Incentive design, in general we need to reallocate our incentives away from fossil fuel and to solar energy, and we know there are some best practices on how to design that. So, for the first years, my recommendation is reallocate investment to the highest benefit, lowest-risk installations, and that is DGPV, and to aggregate smaller projects in a systematic program to reduce risk while delivering the cost of scale. And, I believe that this will effectively stretch public investment, and it will reduce performance and project risk. In the second five years, I would see that we would integrate higher-volume concentrated PV and high-concentrated PV as the cost effectiveness and reliability of those technologies come on line, and begin a second phase of solar thermal development if feasible or necessary. So, in conclusion, the path to progress for the Grand Solar Plan, make balanced, judicious, timely technology choices, structure the investment for fairness and efficiency across all of the investment groups, and match the , megawatt solar thermal projects in process with , megawatts of photovoltaic projects. Thank you for this opportunity to testify, and thank you for your leadership in this critical issue, and especially, Chair, Congresswoman Giffords, I really appreciate your leadership here. It has made a very big difference in Arizona. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Rauluk follows:] Prepared Statement of Valerie Rauluk Madame Chairman, Members of the Committee, distinguished guests I am honored to offer my testimony concerning Utility Scale Solar Power. My comments will address the following: . Grand Solar Plan as a viable option. The technical & regulatory obstacles. . Current solar energy market and expected changes over the next years. . Current regulatory environment and incentive structures conducive to large scale solar development & recommended improvements. . Distributed PV and concentrating PV compared with solar thermal technology. Areas of government research that can play a critical role not met by private sector. Other recommendations and priorities. . The Grand Solar Plan as a viable option. The technical & regulatory obstacles. The Grand Solar Plan calls out a vision of nearly percent of our electricity generation from solar energy by . It also calls for a technology mix of five times as much solar photovoltaic (``PV'') as solar thermal. This vision is highly probable, with the right development framework and investment incentives. Additionally, the Grand Solar Plan calls out for a development format of large-scale remote solar energy generation, compressed air storage, and direct current transmission. My colleagues at the University of Arizona have convinced me that compressed air storage and direct current transmission are more than science fiction, although there is much that needs to be assessed for both approaches to be viable. It is important to note that designing, financing and implementing a large-scale adoption of such strategies is no minor feat. As such, I would see, from my experience and understanding of technology adoption cycles, that such approaches will not be available for commercial adoption for or more years. Other witnesses could clarify the risks, timing and benefits better than I. Beginning the process of assessing and designing such approaches is useful, but I would caution that we focus on the approaches that can deliver large amounts of market driven solar generation into the mix quickly, with the lowest risk and the greatest benefits. As you will see, my comments focus on the first ten years of a Grand Solar Plan. The first steps will be difficult. Large amounts of investment capital from public and private sectors will be needed. And the skeptics concerning solar energy and its primary role in the greening and cleaning of our energy system will be numerous and loud. That is why in the first years, we should focus on efforts that lower risk and maximize the benefits. In addressing the technical and regulatory obstacles to achieving the Grand Plan the following critical factors will be addressed. Critical Factor # --Productively framing the definition of ``utility scale solar'' and supporting with regulatory requirements. Critical Factor # --Technology improvements, including improvements in business model. Critical Factor # --Effectively structuring the multi-billion dollar investment to be made by rate-payers, investors and the government. Critical Factor # --Productively framing the definition of ``utility scale solar'' and supporting with regulatory requirements Although the Grand Solar Plan does not make specific recommendations regarding the development format, it seems to imply, with the recommendation for large scale storage and specialty transmission, that solar energy should be developed under the model of the last years: large scale, remotely located, dependent on extensive transmission for delivery to consumers. This is commonly referred to as the ``central station'' model. There is a more market driven way to develop solar energy and the successes of the last few years highlight the approach. That approach consists of smaller generation facilities, on otherwise unused real estate (roof-tops and sites of to acres of land, two percent to percent of a square mile), located near the load demand, and dispersed throughout many communities. That approach is called distributed generation or ``DG.'' DG is not only a path of more rapid, less risky development, it is also the path for a more robust power network. There is an inherent resiliency in networked systems where resources are at the point of use (like the Internet) instead of a hub and spoke development (like the land-line telephone system). This resiliency can be enhanced with the addition of small scale, on-site intelligent controls and storage, increasing reliability and dependability and improving the fit between resource generation and needs across the local grid. When developed in a strategic and coordinated fashion, DG can delay or eliminate the need for distribution and transmission infrastructure investment. Although DG includes very small generating systems, much larger DG systems (up to MW in a single location) can be clearly characterized as ``utility scale'' as can a systematic aggregation of many smaller generators. Utility scale can be more productively thought of as any project/program offering high volume, lower-cost, reliable, and dependable renewable energy for years plus at fixed prices for large numbers of customers. Utilizing this more expansive definition of utility scale offers more options for maximizing solar energy deployment at the best cost-benefit trade-off, starting now. Examples are: to MW solar farms, strategically located in load pockets to strengthen the grid and increase community energy security in case of transmission failure. to MW solar farms on the roofs of our schools, reducing school budget exposure to volatile and rising energy prices for years and pumping solar power into the grid for community use during the summer days when community demand is most pressing. kW to multiple megawatts on commercial, government, industrial sites/buildings. In Arizona alone, an immediate potential of multiple gigawatts of solar energy systems are available. With expected cost reductions, GW of solar energy could be developed in the U.S. over the next ten years (U.S. Department of Energy. Solar America Initiative, http:// www .eere.energy.gov/solar/solar - america/). Central station development has its attractions. It feeds into the `bigger is better' syndrome. Bigger means more attention. Bigger means larger development fees. Usually bigger means cheaper. But what a great deal of research has shown, is that bigger, especially when it comes to power plants, can often be riskier: longer construction periods, higher financing cost, longer delays before a system is producing and selling energy to end-users, to name just a few. Bigger also usually means more remotely located from where the consumers are, a distance that results in additional costs for transmission: wheeling charges, transmission investment and public approval (nobody seems to want transmission lines in their backyards), and transmission losses. And last, but not least the security exposure of having a critical resource like power, vulnerable to hundreds of miles of difficult to protect delivery infrastructure. Removing the Obstacles Since nearly all of our existing power generation is central station, and a considerable amount of central station solar power is in the early stages of development, our focus going forward should be to diversify our resource portfolio and focus on solar DG installations. Regulatory Regulatory obstacles to this path are fairly straightforward and in fact, many states have established law, policy and procedure to remove them. That is how MW of solar energy got developed last year. But the patchwork has prevented a truly vibrant and efficient market for solar energy. Efforts at the federal level to establish the following best practices will accelerate the development of solar energy. Level the playing field for incentives, subsidies and financing Establish incentives at the federal level that match the incentives given to fossil fuels. Structure for rapid and long-term deployments with declining levels of support to encourage systematic and focused cost reduction across the whole value chain. Reward system performance and support system diversity, Net Metering Require full retail value for all solar energy produced by customers without restrictions on size, or special fees and tariffs. Standard & Fair Interconnection Standards to the Grid Interconnection standards set the rules and fees for connecting a customer generator to the grid. The standard should encourage the development of customer systems, while maintaining the safety and integrity of the grid. A fair and reasonable standard has been broadly vetted and adopted in the leading renewable energy states and should be adopted nation-wide. Solar Fair & Friendly Rates & Utility Revenue Practices Properly designed rates can support investment in solar energy and wise use while maintaining utility profits. Critical Factor # --Technology improvements, including improvements in business model Technical Cost and efficiency, especially of components have been perennial obstacles to widespread use of solar energy. Both of those concerns have been and are being addressed with incremental improvements. In addition, major improvements are possible in the in the six- to -year time frame as research and development initiatives currently in process begin focused commercialization. Two areas of consideration that have not received as much attention in the past are storage strategies and intelligent control technologies that facilitate integration of renewable energy into the grid. Storage is important for solar energy. It expands its flexibility by extending access to the power produced during sunlight hours. Storage schemes can be grand and large, like compressed-air energy storage. Because of scale and site limitation this approach is not being actively integrated into deployment projects. Other forms of storage such as flow batteries, inverter based micro storage, and flywheels are being considered. The storage industry is currently at a stage of development very similar to where PV was less than years ago. Low volume market demand has meant low volume manufacturing and all of the cost premiums that entails. Properly incentivized storage options will bring investment and scale to its manufacture with the concomitant cost reduction. From the perspective of solar energy deployment in the near- term, these forms of storage should receive both research and incentive support, while core research continues on large scale, big bite strategies that will not be functionally available for five to ten years. Intelligent controls are especially useful to maximize the potential benefits of DG deployment to the grid. Such controls could allocate generation resources across a distribution node to maximize value. Many of these controls are inverter based and would require software and minor hardware additions and modifications, a low cost solution with significant benefits. In addition to technical changes (including modifications of UL ), these benefits could be best achieved through a development mechanism of aggregating individual DG sites. There are some fundamental business model improvements that need to be made to integrate DG into the existing utility business model in a way that protects revenues and existing asset base. Technical Improvements in business model One of the most important innovations supporting rapid deployment of solar energy has been the technical advance in business models. The solar industry's explosive growth in the last few years has been directly related to the development and use of the solar power purchase agreement (PPA). In over percent of the national nonresidential market for solar electric power was developed under PPAs, up from percent in (``Solar Power Services: How PPAs are changing the PV Value Chain,'' Greentech Media, February, ). The solar PPA essentially finances the up-front capital cost and offers customers the output from PV systems at or below the cost of fossil fuel generation. The solar PPA developer monetizes the federal and local tax credits, facilitates utility incentives and renewable energy credit sales, and designs and implements all business processes to minimize and absorb the risk that the customer would otherwise be forced to assume. These risks include: financial, technology, system performance, construction and regulatory. With discipline and innovation, PPA developers have improved and enhanced the solar photovoltaic transaction across the entire value chain, bringing greater profitability and lower prices to the market place. It was this customer-centric focus, at a time when customers were reeling from rate increases and pricing volatility that resulted in such an expansion of system installations. The solar PPA using PV technology, offers two financial risk reduction strategies for customers: capital acquisition and future price protection. Under the solar PPA, the developer monetizes all of the incentives and tax credits and through aggregation, secures private sector project financing. Because of the nature of PV technology, especially minimal operations and maintenance requirements once installed, and long-term predictable performance output (PV panels have warranties of years), PV can offer firm prices under contract for years. This means an effective -year hedge against rising fossil fuel prices for the customer. It is this hedge against rising electric power prices fueled by resources with uncertain and volatile pricing that has made the PV PPAs so successful. The next generation of solar PPAs, currently entering the market continues this customer-centric focus, but with the addition of utility-centric features. The recent success of solar thermal technologies in the market place ( , MW of solar thermal contracts have been initiated with construction expected to be complete in the next three years) highlights the importance of utility-centric features. Solar thermal is a traditional steam turbine electric power generation process, fueled primarily by solar collectors instead of coal, natural gas or nuclear reaction. The familiarity helps many utility executives more readily consider the solar thermal option. But since the approach incorporates a traditional power block, it shares many of the risks and inefficiencies of indirect, multi-stage conversions of energy: large scale, remote location, transmission dependent, multi-year construction, and big impact financing, performance, and operation risks. For these reasons and more, it is not a technology choice and a development approach that can be relied upon to deliver large volume, rapid deployment of solar energy in the first phase. Large scale, strategic, and multi-year development of solar energy in the distributed generation format, especially in the next year period is essential for achieving the goals of Grand Plan for Solar Energy. Solar energy is a disruptive technology. Disruptive technologies by definition create risk. But disruptive technologies, like the automobile that replaced the horse and buggy, can offer massive improvements in quality of life and prosperity. What mitigates that risk and transforms it into opportunity is the right technology of doing business, the right business model. Such a model must be both customer-centric and utility-centric. Utility revenue and the remaining life of the massive investment made by investors and rate-payers in conventional generation, power distribution and transmission assets must be protected and maximized as best possible while incorporating solar technologies. But not at the expense of future competitiveness and resiliency. A major obstacle to massive solar energy deployment, in addition to cost and efficiency, has been conflict. Innovations in the solar PPA, coupled with other innovations in power financing entering the marketplace, are designed to end the current conflict between distributed generation and utility revenue protection while establishing more effective and fair financing for rate-payers. It is in our interest to end the conflict. Much can be gained from strategic deployment of DG: improved system reliability, reduction or elimination of transmission & distribution expenditures, reduction of local congestion, voltage support, low cost to no cost for non-participants, and reduced subsidies. Deploying and integrating generators, smart meters and intelligent controls, energy efficiency, virtual net metering, green tariffs and effective storage will permit greater control of load and generation. It is important to note how great the need is for strengthening and hardening our power grid. ``. . .the United States has three times as many power outages of the United Kingdom and over times as many power outages of Japan. Both Japan and the United Kingdom have achieved this reliability in part by investing in st century distributed generation technologies-distributed solar, combined heat and power, fuel cells, energy efficiency measures, and other customer-centric market solutions.

Issues in Science & Technology. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi I qa / is I /ai I n ) Finally, just as ``simple, easy'' is a useful guiding principle for technologies and technology systems, it is a good design principle for business models as well. ``Solar PPA . '' can reduce and eliminate the need for complex and copious regulations, mandates and other policy requirements. Critical Factor # --Effectively structuring the multi-billion dollar investment that will be made by rate-payers, investors and the government. The solar energy investment envisioned by the Grand Solar Plan is significant and such an investment should be fair to all investors and maximize both direct and indirect benefits. Because solar energy financing consists of several mechanisms: tax advantages, utility sector incentives payments, and private capital different investor groups are coordinated in the transaction. Fairness would recommend that all investors receive benefits that justify the investment made. The federal investment for solar is no different than investments made over the last years for general public access to energy and electric power. From to $ billion was spent by the Federal Government for support to nuclear power, $ . billion; solar energy, $ . billion; and wind, $ . billion. (``Federal Energy Subsidies: Not All Technologies are Created Equal,'' Marshall Goldberg, Renewable Energy Policy Project, Research Report July , No. ). Clearly, for solar energy to become more broadly available, restructuring of the federal energy investment must be made. The rate-payer contribution is the area of greatest concern for assuring fairness. At the current level of financing for a residential rate-payer, usually less than $ per year, when some rate-payers benefit more than others, although contributing benefits for all, there is less need for concern. But for the kind of investment that the Grand Solar Plan would entail, spreading the benefits across all rate-payer classes and all communities is crucial. The DG development approach can distribute the benefits across a broader range of rate-payers and communities. But the fairness issue still remains. Not all rate-payers are in a position to invest in solar energy systems even with the tax credits and utility incentives available. The new funding mechanisms must be designed so that those who can directly benefit, contribute greater investment. Recent developments in PPAs for the DG market can increase the fairness, if the directive to support utility scale coordinated DG development is made. . The current marketplace for solar energy and expected evolution. The current solar energy market has been dominated by DG deployment of PV, although , MW of solar thermal projects are expected to be built in the next few years. PV deployment over the next five years is conservatively projected to increase percent annually. Worldwide deployment was just under GW and is expected to increase to GW by . US deployments of approximately MW (SEIA as reported by the Wall Street Journal / / ) are conservatively expected to grow in excess of percent annually (internal proprietary analysis). The U.S. market is commonly considered to be the next high growth solar market, anticipating greater consolidation of political will and the necessary regulatory framework at the U.S. federal level. PV is on track for delivering promised cost reductions. Incremental improvements in silicon pricing, silicon utilization and overall system costs are expected to decrease annually at a consistent, but modest level. This is independent of any major game changing technology or manufacturing process coming on-line. There are cost, performance and manufacturing processing improvements in the pipeline, but it is uncertain when, and at what scale they will enter the marketplace. Commercialization is a highly uncertain process and although it is clear that more attention and investment has been directed toward PV improvements across the entire value chain, it is unclear how soon those improvements will be translated into value. The Grand Plan calls out thin film and expected cost reductions. In general, I am in agreement, though my colleagues at University of Arizona have pointed out some of the fundamental resource issues from both a supply and a toxicity perspective, with the cadmium telluride cells. They and others are working on next generation materials with great promise that avoid supply and toxicity concerns, but again, there are uncertainties concerning time to market. The greatest concern in the next three to five years may be financing. Solar energy financing comes from multiple sources (federal, utility rate payers and private capital). Difficulties in any of the sectors will constrain the total financing. In particular, without new approaches to utility contributions, in the current near-recessionary (recessionary) environment, there will be limits to how much of a cost burden can be placed on the rate-payer. PV and HCPV technologies should and will dominate development in the next ten years, especially in a DG format. With all the talk of large-scale projects and exporting to the rest of the country, it would make sense to take care of the domestic needs of potential power exporters first and then use the fixed cost clean power to build generation for export. The Grand Solar Plan suggests equal development on a GW basis for each technology for the next ten years. On that basis alone, with , MW of solar thermal in process, the focus for the next five to years should be on PV deployment, especially in the DG development model (PV because it is scalable, modular and flexible can be developed in a central station format or distributed format). Another way to think about it is to emphasize the technology that offers the ``two-fers'' or perhaps more elegantly ``positive externalities.'' These are other positive benefits that come from the technologies, independent of clean, cost-effective energy generation. Economic development and job creation is essentially the same for each technology, more maintenance jobs for solar thermal, more flexible job experience for PV. Solar thermal is not less expensive than PV, and there is evidence that it is more expensive when comparing scale to scale. Other features and comparisons will be discussed later. PV is scalable and flexible and it can be developed across a whole range of sizes from a few kilowatts to +MW on rooftops and ground mounted, using land that may not have any other productive use. Developed near to the customer demand, transmission costs can be saved. Larger numbers but smaller installations spread across more communities could be deployed, permitting more people and more communities to participate in the economic benefits of a large infrastructure development campaign. Large scale DG deployment also offers additional reliability as has been noted above. Scale development of any solar technology has the potential to bring cost down, from component manufacturing to installation practices to financing and other transaction costs. Utility scale solar thermal provides component scale benefit solely to utility scale solar thermal. Because the same components are used in PV small scale to utility scale, any wins in the PV area have benefits across the whole range from utility scale down to the small systems on homes or for remote emergency applications. For the next three to five years it is critical that we allocate solar energy investment to the highest benefit lowest risk installations. That would suggest a predominant role for DG, where the rate-payer investment can be more effectively stretched with private capital, and where the investment has the biggest return to rate- payers: near the load, dispersed throughout communities, benefiting more communities. Larger investments, with longer construction periods, greater cost of construction exposure, higher technology and performance risks, are less beneficial under the current constrained conditions. Since PV can go to scale in a DG format ( to MWs) and at the higher MW level, deliver price breaks equal to or below the current cost of large scale solar power, it is prudent to focus on PV technology and DG scale. As presented in the technology obstacles above, DG presents difficulties for utilities concerning revenue loss. With the entry into the market place of means to address those concerns, large volume strategically developed and integrated DG projects utilizing PV technologies will dominate in the next years. In the second five, CPV and HCPV advances in scalability will support additional DG and more cost effective central station from regions like Arizona that have good solar resource and available land. . Current regulatory environment and incentive structure & large- scale solar development. Key to large scale development in the near-term is the extension of the Federal Investment Tax Credit, standard interconnection and net metering at the federal level, support for solar energy on federal lands and protection for the key solar energy financing mechanism to date, the Power Purchase Agreement (``PPA''). The rationale for the first two issues have been offered and discussed above. Support for solar energy development on federal lands could be in terms of multipliers for requirements for federal agencies to deploy solar energy on-site and other federal lands as was done in EPACT (energy production is doubled for accounting purposes), and in reducing the administrative burden for long-term leases, etc. The fourth issue, protection for the PPA, like standard interconnection and net metering has been addressed in many states, but not all. This requirement concerns the ability of PPAs to be offered by solar energy developers without the burden of excessive and unnecessary regulatory requirements and approval. Federally preempting state attempts to prohibit or restrict on-site generation could consist of the following: ``Provision of electricity from equipment which uses solar energy to generate electricity shall not be considered a sale of electricity for the purposes of any federal, State, or local regulation governing sales of electricity or regulating utility service, provided the sale is to serve load on the premises where the system is located, or on contiguous property.'' . Distributed photovoltaics, concentrating photovoltaics, solar thermal technology comparisons, R&D funding & Congressional actions. Solar energy consists of two kinds of approaches: capturing the sun's photons (solar electric, photovoltaics, ``PV'') and capturing the sun's heat (solar thermal). These approaches can be developed in two formats: central station and distributed generation (``DG''). Central Station consists of large scale ( MW to GW, multiple square miles), remotely located, and connected to the grid via transmission lines and infrastructure for distances up to hundreds of miles. Distributed generation (``DG'') consists of micro generators of hundreds of watts up to MW and can be located near the consumer demand. DG does not require transmission infrastructure, and is delivered to the end-user directly through the service panel or in larger systems of multiple megawatts by means of distribution lines and equipment. Capturing the sun's heat requires components and equipment that is different depending on whether the developed in central station or DG format. Capturing the sun's photons, depends on similar components regardless of small scale or large-scale development. (This is particularly true for PV. For concentrating and high concentrating PV, smaller scale may not be effective). Utility scale solar thermal approaches include parabolic troughs, power towers, and other systems. Most systems concentrate the sun's heat and focus that heat on production of steam to turn electric generators that then produce electricity. PV, concentrating PV (``CPV'' to equivalent suns) and high concentrating PV (``HCPV'' in excess of suns) all use semi- conductor material that when exposed to the photons of the sun, directly produce electric current. The concentrating technologies, by means of special lens, dishes and reflective surfaces, effectively multiply the potential electric current from the photon energy of the sun (some proposed CPV systems are hybrids and use heat for energy production, but they are exceptions). Such systems require tracking and sophisticated thermal management. The complexity is offset by the potential to substantially increase the percent efficiency of PV to to percent. As sophisticated tracking and thermal management technologies from other industries, especially the defense industry, migrate to the CPV and HCPV arena, these complexities could be profitably managed. As experience increases the certainty regarding performance, CPV and HCPV can become more viable, especially those that lend themselves to a scalable, modular and flexible development profile. (Please see pictures of systems following the text). A key consideration for assessing the functionality and finance- ability of a technology, is how quickly and efficiently it can be deployed. Finance-ability requires long-term dependable production, either low cost or reasonably predictable operation and maintenance costs, and other minimized risk factors. The following table summarizes risk factors for PV and solar thermal. Due to the limited deployment of CPV and HCPV technologies, the risk analysis was not meaningful. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] There is a feature of solar thermal that may make it more advantageous and that is storage. Adequate storage increases the dispatch-ability and value of solar energy generation. Large-scale storage for solar thermal, supported by fossil fuel generation, is purported to be farther along in the development and reliability cycle than large-scale storage options for PV. Several proposed projects with storage features are expected to be completed in the next three years and will clarify. Development Format: Central Station and Distributed Generation PV (and CPV and HCPV) can be developed in a DG or central station format, though nearly all developments to date have been in a DG format. Utility scale solar thermal requires a central station format. As has been discussed, there are many advantages to DG, as summarized below: [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Other Regulatory & Incentive Mechanisms Pricing Carbon Emissions Currently, pricing carbon emissions has been done indirectly, through an assumed green value attributed to generation from renewable sources. How these attributes are valued and bought and sold is dependent upon the regulatory framework adopted by the state where the project is located. Establishing market based pricing mechanisms at the national level, by means of carbon taxes and/or carbon trading would be very productive and supportive of rapid and efficient deployment of solar energy. Among other positive results would be a reduction in transaction costs. Setting Standards & Mandates Although market driven strategies are always to be preferred on core resource issues, standards and mandates are often prudent and necessary to achieve certain objectives. The electric power industry is a regulated monopoly and does not operate in an environment where competitive alternatives can be easily presented and adopted. This is especially true in a market where many of the negative costs have not been systematically included, as is true for electric power. A national requirement or standard for renewable energy deployment could be helpful. Summary of Federal Research & Development Support and Regulations Research & Development .

LOCKWOOD, MANAGER, RENEWABLE ENERGY, ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY Ms. Lockwood. Madam Chairman, Members of the Committee, and staff, thank you for the opportunity to provide APS' perspective on utility-scale solar power. Arizona is the second fastest growing state in the country, growing at three times the national average. APS serves more than a million customers, who at their peak consume more than , megawatts of electricity, and electricity demand is growing at a rate of hundreds of megawatts each and every year. As has been discussed all afternoon this afternoon, in Arizona our most abundant resource is sunshine, and APS is looking for ways to put the sun to work providing electricity. APS is committed to making Arizona the solar capitol of the world. The focus of my comments today is on CSP or Concentrating Solar Power technology, which we have also heard a lot about from the previous witnesses today. As Congressman Mitchell mentioned, APS recently announced the Solana Generating Station. Solana is a megawatt solar power plant, to be located just outside of Phoenix, Arizona. APS has signed a long-term contract with Abengoa Solar, the project developer and owner, for all of the electricity generated by Solana. If operating today, Solana would be the largest power plant, solar power plant, in the world. The plant will use nearly three square miles of parabolic trough mirrors and receiver pipes, and operating at full capacity the plant will produce enough electricity to power , homes. Also mentioned frequently today, including Congressman Hall and Chairman Gordon, is the importance of energy storage when it comes to solar, and that is one of the most important aspects of the Solana Generating Station, is its ability to capture and store energy for later use. By using large insulated tanks filled with molten salt, heat captured during the day can be stored and used to produce electricity when the sun is no longer shining. This value cannot be underestimated. Because it can provide energy even after the sun has set, this technology provides maximum value and reliability for APS and its customers. Solana also provides significant economic benefits for the State of Arizona. The Solana Generating Station will provide , construction jobs, and permanent operations jobs. The total economic impact is much greater. All totaled, Solana will result in over a billion dollars in economic development for Arizona. And, Solana is not the end of APS' interest in CSP, as Kate mentioned earlier we believe this is a viable commercial technology that can provide significant energy for our customers in coming years. Depending on many factors, APS alone could envision over , megawatts of CSP in our system in the next to years. Today, the single biggest obstacle in the success of Solana is the potential expiration of the percent investment tax credit. I am sure that is something you have heard many times before, and will probably hear many times again. Without this tax credit, Solana is simply not affordable today. I also need to be clear that a one- or two-year extension of the ITC will not be sufficient. While it may be acceptable for small-scale solar projects, and for wind projects, large- scale solar is different. The approval, permitting and construction of the Solana Generating Station will take three to four years to complete. We cannot begin until we know it will be eligible ITC once it is complete. As Congressman Mitchell mentioned, if a long-term extension of the ITC is not granted, Solana will not be completed. If the ITC is extended for a sufficient period, there will be many other plants like Solana built in the next five to years. If not, the industry will lose its momentum and no large-scale solar plants will be constructed. The future of large-scale solar depends on getting those first few plants in operation. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and Members of the Committee, for the opportunity to share this information with you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Lockwood follows:] Prepared Statement of Barbara D. Lockwood Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide Arizona Public Service Company's (APS') perspective on utility-scale solar power. My comments will focus on the opportunity solar provides for clean, reliable electricity, and the challenges associated with realizing that potential. APS is the largest and longest serving electric power utility in Arizona. Arizona is the second fastest growing state in the country, and APS has more than a million customers who, at their peak energy consumption, use more than , megawatts of electricity. By , APS will have nearly two million customers demanding over , megawatts of electricity. To meet this rapid growth in electricity demand, APS is investing $ billion a year in infrastructure. That number does not include additional generation sources. For APS alone, our peak demand is growing at hundreds of megawatts per year, or the equivalent of one medium-sized natural gas plant each and every year. Meeting the growing needs of our customers is both a challenge and an opportunity. In Arizona, our most abundant renewable resource is sunshine. The solar resource in Arizona is virtually unlimited, with more than days of sunshine each year. In addition, Arizona has sizable quantities of wide-open, flat landscape that is ideal for the installation of large-scale solar equipment. Among the most important factors in considering a resource for electricity production is the reliability of the fuel. Arizona's solar climate provides a resource that is both dependable and predictable. APS is committed to making Arizona the solar capital of the world and bringing affordable renewable energy to all its customers. A balanced renewable energy portfolio including solar, wind, geothermal and biomass/biogas resources is fundamental to our operating strategy. For the past two decades, APS has worked with the solar industry and researchers around the U.S. and the world to bring lower cost and reliable solar electricity to our customers. In , the APS Solar Technology And Research (STAR) center was developed to support the advancement of solar resources, including field operation of both photovoltaic and concentrating solar technologies. In addition to STAR, APS currently has over five megawatts of photovoltaic power plants in operation providing reliable solar energy to our customers. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] APS has also supported the advancement of concentrating solar power (CSP). These technologies are ``thermal electric systems'' that use solar heat to drive generators and engines. CSP thermal systems include solar trough concentrator systems and central receiver (power tower) systems that use many mirrors to focus light on a central solar collector. CSP also include solar dish Stirling systems and other advanced solar concepts. In fact, APS constructed the first commercial CSP plant in the United States in almost years. The Saguaro Solar Power Plant, which came on-line in , is a one megawatt parabolic trough facility located just north of Tucson at Red Rock, Arizona. This plant has provided critical learning for APS, the CSP industry, and researchers. While small in size, it has facilitated new interest in CSP around the country and the world. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] But that was just the beginning of our entrance into commercial CSP. Also in , APS stepped forward to lead a coalition of southwestern utilities interested in CSP. The Joint Development Group is a consortium of seven entities exploring the possibility of a megawatt CSP project to be located in Arizona or Nevada. Acting as project coordinator, APS issued a request for proposals in December of . If all goes well, the consortium project could be selected this summer. But our most significant step to date is the announcement on February , , of the Solana Generating Station. Solana is a megawatt solar power plant to be located miles southwest of Phoenix near Gila Bend, Arizona. APS has signed a long-term contract with Abengoa Solar, project developer and owner, for percent of the electricity generated by Solana. Solana is the Spanish word for ``sunny place.'' If operating today, Solana would be the largest solar power plant in the world. The plant will use nearly three square miles of parabolic trough mirrors and receiver pipes, coupled with two -megawatt steam generators. Operating at full capacity, the plant will produce enough electricity to power , Arizona homes. Solana also provides significant economic benefits to the State of Arizona. The Solana Generating Station will provide , construction jobs between and and permanent operations jobs. Solana will also generate between $ million and $ million in tax revenue over the year life of the plant. All total, Solana will result in over $ billion in economic development for the Arizona economy. Finally, Solana is an emission-free source of electricity, avoiding nearly , tons of carbon dioxide, , tons of nitrogen oxides, and tons of sulfur dioxide each year. It is the equivalent of removing , cars from the road each year. Solana will also use percent less water than the current agricultural usage of the land. APS selected Abengoa Solar as its partner for Solana because of its track record as a solar developer, its critical operational experience and a reputation for meeting contractual obligations. One of the most important aspects of Solana is its ability to capture and store solar energy for later use. By incorporating large insulated tanks filled with molten salt, heat captured during the day can be stored and used to produce electricity when the sun is no longer shining. The molten salt and heavily insulated tanks are able to retain heat with very high efficiency, and the stored heat can then be extracted in the evening or even the following day to create electricity. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] The stored heat not only increases the total amount of electricity generated, it also adds specific operating benefits for APS. The ability to use stored heat on demand, also referred to as ``dispatching,'' allows APS to respond to customer usage patterns and emergency energy needs more effectively. Most southwest utilities experience their highest customer demand during the summer months. While the power need is substantial in the middle of the day, peak energy demand occurs in the late afternoon and into the early evening hours. Because it can provide energy even after the sun has set, the solar trough with thermal energy storage provides the maximum value for APS and its customers. Diversification of generation resources is critical to maintaining a reliable electric system and concentrating solar power provides a significant opportunity to diversify energy resources. In addition, the costs to construct and maintain concentrating solar power plants have declined while at the same time equipment and labor costs, rising fuel prices and emissions concerns are increasing the risks of conventional resources. APS also recognizes that renewable energy strategies will become even more important under the prospects of carbon legislation. With zero carbon emissions, energy from solar power provides one method of addressing concerns around global warming while continuing to provide reliable electricity to our customers. And Solana is not the end of our interest in CSP. APS is currently engaged in a formal dialogue with our regulators, stakeholders and customers about our future energy sources. We are exploring the availability, cost, regulatory and policy implications associated with many different types of resources including nuclear, natural gas, coal, energy efficiency and renewable energy. One of several scenarios under discussion is one where CSP plays a central role, adding , megawatts by . Each of these efforts will help us to meet, and possibly exceed, the progressive Renewable Energy Standard established by the Arizona Corporation Commission. CSP, in particular the solar trough, is proven, reliable technology. There are no technical barriers to deployment of this technology today, and APS is aggressively exploring the near-term potential. In considering the long-term potential for utility scale solar, one topic of consideration is how to integrate large solar plants into the regional and national electric grid. This topic raises numerous issues including availability of land for large scale installation and the availability of transmission facilities and transmission capacity to deliver the energy to load centers. The lack of transmission capacity and how that is managed will be a significant factor in the long-term success of utility-scale solar. In fact, transmission is generally constrained in much of the west and significant new transmission investment is needed in the coming years for all types of generation be they renewable or conventional generation. New transmission is being planned throughout the west and in California, New Mexico, Nevada, and Texas specifically to access renewable resources including wind and geothermal. Others states and utilities, including APS, are studying their needs for both intra- and interstate transmission to ensure a robust grid to meet the needs of the West's burgeoning population. The studies include the ability to reach those areas of the west with abundant cost-effective renewable resources. Also, the possibility of locating large scale solar on federal land should be investigated and analyzed. By its nature, solar technologies require significant geographic footprints. A general rule of thumb for a solar installation is five to acres per megawatt. As I previously stated, the Solana Generating Station requires three square miles of contiguous land. Considering that the Federal Government is the largest land owner in the U.S., a study of federal land in high solar resource areas that may be made available for CSP development would also be beneficial and appropriate. However, the biggest obstacle to the success of utility-scale solar, including Solana, is the potential expiration of the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Solana, and projects like Solana, became possible when the federal ITC for solar systems was increased from percent to percent in . While large-scale solar is still more expensive than conventional resources, the percent investment tax credit decreased the cost sufficient to make these projects a reasonable option. Without these tax credits, large scale solar projects, including Solana, are simply not affordable today. As you know, the percent ITC is scheduled to expire at the end of . The approval, permitting and construction of the Solana Generating Station will take three to four years to complete. The Solana project also requires well over a billion in capital investment. APS, Abengoa Solar, and the financial institutions providing funding for Solana require certainty that Solana will be eligible for the ITC once operational. If a long-term extension of the ITC is not granted, Solana will not be completed. A different federal tax credit, the production tax credit (PTC), has spurred significant development for other renewable energy resources, most notably wind energy. The PTC has been extended five times since its introduction in and each extension was for one to two years. Although the wind industry has worked toward longer-term extensions, wind energy projects, and smaller scale solar projects, have much shorter time frames for construction, which makes short-term extensions of the PTC acceptable, if not preferable. Although the solar ITC is typically packaged with the PTC in discussions of extensions, large-scale solar has very different needs related to tax credits. A one- or two-year extension of the solar ITC is simply not sufficient to make large scale solar projects like Solana a reality. In fact, a one or two year extension of the Solar ITC may effectively cancel the project. Large scale solar has little hope of realizing its potential without a long-term extension of the ITC. APS believes an eight-year extension is optimal. Eight years should be sufficient to get a number of large scale solar facilities completed. It is also long enough to establish the supporting industries like mirror and receiver manufacturing in the United States. Once the industry gains a foothold, prices will decline and incentives will no longer be necessary. Another critical aspect of the ITC is the fact that it is not available to public utilities. The restriction needlessly narrows application of the credit and is unfair to U.S. citizens because the vast majority purchase power from a public utility, as it is defined by the tax code. This current policy forces a third-party owner to take advantage of the ITC and it creates unnecessary uncertainty and costs to the system. It requires the utility and regional grid to consider the operational and financial risks inherent in any third party relationship thus potentially affecting the utility operating strategies. APS is managing these risks with Solana, but it creates a sub-optimum situation when it is the only strategy available. I was also requested to address a recently published article. ``A Solar Grand Plan,'' published in the Scientific American Magazine in December , describes a world where solar energy provides percent of the U.S.'s electricity by . It includes huge tracts of land covered in solar and a new direct-current transmission system across the U.S. It also includes -hour thermal storage for CSP and compressed-air energy storage for photovoltaics, which allow the production of energy from solar resources around the clock. ``A Solar Grand Plan'' is certainly grand. It's a big, bold vision for a new energy era. Without analyzing the details of the plan, there appear to be no glaring technical issues with the proposed strategies. CSP and photovoltaics are proven technologies. As described, thermal storage and compressed-air energy storage are likely viable concepts. Finally, direct current transmission is already in operation today. No, the challenges with this plan are not technical. But there are enormous planning, regulatory, and policy challenges with achieving this vision. Most importantly, energy policy decisions are made largely at the individual utility and State level. Each utility and state has different perspectives, and different regulatory authorities, that control the vast majority of decisions around generation sources and transmission. And although I haven't analyzed the cost presented in the article, the execution of such a plan would clearly depend on gaining great cost efficiencies. Clearly, the potential for utility scale solar electricity is enormous. If, and only if, the ITC is given a long-term extension, I predict we will see several thousand megawatts of utility scale solar developed in the next five to years. At least seven major projects have been announced since . If the ITC is not extended for a sufficiently long period of time, the industry will lose its precious momentum and no large scale solar plants are likely to be constructed. The future of large scale solar depends heavily extending the ITC and getting those first few plants in operation. These initial plants are planned to supplement existing fossil fuel resources and help to satisfy our growing energy needs. In the long- term, utility scale solar could be a viable option in replacing base load fossil fuel facilities as those assets are retired. But costs need to decline significantly to make that a viable option. Only then will solar be a viable option for replacing base load assets that are being retired. Assuming success in the near-term, the prospect for the next to years is virtually unlimited.

JOSEPH KASTNER, VICE PRESIDENT OF IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATIONS, MMA RENEWABLE VENTURES LLC Mr. Kastner. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and the Subcommittee Members, for providing this opportunity. As many of your questions addressed the Nellis Air Force Base project I would like to begin by recognizing Lieutenant Colonel Karen White, who is in the audience today. Lieutenant Colonel White was instrumental in making the Nellis Air Force Base project a success, and it is great to have her here. Ms. Giffords. Welcome, Colonel, thank you for being here today. We appreciate it. Mr. Kastner. On behalf of MMA Renewable Ventures and the solar industry, I am happy to provide the following comments related to the development and financing of utility-scale solar. In , MMA completed the project development and third party financing of over megawatts of solar, including the megawatt facility at Nellis Air Force Base, the largest PV installation in North America. We are actually pursuing domestic opportunities in other renewables and our parent company MMA has built this business largely around sustainable and socially-responsible investment opportunities, including affordable housing, renewable energy, and sustainable land investments. Ms. Giffords. Mr. Kastner, I don't mean to interrupt, but can you move the microphone a little bit closer? Mr. Kastner. Sure. Ms. Giffords. Okay. Mr. Kastner. The Nellis project involves a public/private partnership that is advantageous because the affiliated public entities could not avail themselves of the Federal tax benefits. The project was enabled by the following commercial arrangements: . LA -year site lease with the United States Air Force; . LA power purchase agreement with Nellis Air Force Base; . LAn agreement to sell Nevada Power the renewable energy credits associated with the project for years; . LAn installation contract with Sun Power Corporation; . LAnd finally, financial arrangements that included construction financing from Merrill Lynch, permanent debt financing from John Hancock, and tax equity financing from Citicorp, Allstate and MMA Financial. The combination of these complex legal and financial arrangements enabled the project. We believe that this type of public/private partnership provides a commercial approach that can be used at a variety of sites of varying size and scale in the U.S. All fuel-less electric generation technologies are more capital intensive than conventional combustion-based technologies. And thus, they require long-term stability and certainty in financial, legal and regulatory environments, in order to mobilize the long-term investment. The following concepts are key to providing stability and certainty for solar projects. As has already been mentioned, first and foremost, a long- term extension is needed for the current percent investment tax credit. The ITC is critical to the development and financing of utility-scale solar projects and DG projects, and necessary to ensure continuing domestic project development. History has shown that the short-term tax credit, subject to the uncertainty of congressional reauthorization, can actually be detrimental to the development of renewable energy. Uncertainty around the extensions of the production tax credit for wind power increases the cost of capital for projects and causes the inflation of equipment costs due to supply constraints. We would expect the same fate for solar without the long-term extension of the tax incentive. Stability and certainty are also critical for the commercial arrangements which enable the projects. In the case of the Nellis installation, a change in law risk within the standard REC contract had the potential to make the project somewhat less than financeable. If the Public Utility Commission of Nevada had not issued an order that provided assurances regarding this change in law risk the project may not have been financed. In most states where solar PV projects are being implemented, they are enabled, at least in part, by State renewable portfolio standards. This is certainly true for the Nellis project. The geographic reach and timing of such programs would be enhanced through a Federal initiative. The National RPS would provide certainty by guaranteeing a minimum degree of market demand for renewable energy. Such an initiative must provide ample flexibility for State programs that surpass federal minimum standards and encourage the dissemination of best regulatory and utility procurement practices, including standardized contracts that provide sufficient long-term certainty for mobilizing capital markets. Such an initiative should also support diversification through the development of promising technologies in appropriate regions. A specific solar requirement from the Nevada RPS helped to enable the Nellis project, and is why it occurred in Nevada, and not in Arizona or New Mexico. Lastly, a federal cap and trade system, or emission tax, would help to internalize the environmental and social costs of emissions caused by burning fossil fuels. This would also help to create a level playing field for all generation types. In conclusion, investors are beginning to respond to the market-driving incentives for solar energy provided by Federal and State government. The Nellis project is a great example of how these types of incentives can be combined to create a viable project opportunity. These types of opportunities will only reach the volumes required to significantly reduce the costs of solar energy if the incentive programs are structured to ensure the creation of a stable, long-term market for investment. The market for these opportunities could be expanded greatly through various actions at the federal level, including a national RPS and the adoption of a market mechanism or tax for internalizing external costs of emissions from conventional energy sources. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kastner follows:] Prepared Statement of Joseph Kastner Good Morning. On behalf of my company, MMA Renewable Ventures, LLC and the solar industry, I am happy to provide the following comments related to the development and financing of utility scale solar projects. In , MMA Renewable Ventures completed the project development and financing of more solar photovoltaic projects in the United States than any other company in the U.S. as measured by total capacity installed (more than MWp) from over discrete projects. We are especially proud of the development and financing of the MWp solar photovoltaic (PV) project on Nellis Air Force Base--the largest such project ever built in North America and one of the largest in the world. In a significant portion of these projects, the land owner and power purchaser has been a public entity such as a Federal Government department, municipality, or transit district. As you know, such entities cannot avail themselves of the federal investment tax credits (ITCs) and accelerated depreciation benefits offered under the Internal Revenue Code. In all of these transactions, MMA Renewable Ventures served as the third party project developer and financing party which develops the projects, negotiates the power purchase agreements, secures the necessary land rights, negotiates engineering, procurement, and construction contracts, negotiates interconnection agreements with distribution utilities, and obtains construction and permanent financing (debt and tax equity). Consequently, we are intimately knowledgeable and experienced with every aspect of project development and finance of solar PV projects. In addition to solar PV projects, MMA Renewable Ventures is actively pursuing and developing wind, biomass, biofuel, and energy efficiency opportunities in the U.S. market. We expect to add energy efficiency projects to our portfolio of operational assets in and wind, biomass, and biofuel projects within the next two calendar years. Similar to solar, many of these opportunities are dependent upon an extension of currently existing tax credit provisions, in this case the production tax credit (PTC) in Section of the tax code. MuniMae, the parent company of MMA Renewable Ventures, has built a business largely around sustainable and socially responsible investment opportunities. Historically, this has involved affordable housing and more recently renewable energy and sustainable land investments. Description of the Solar Project at Nellis AFB The development and financing of the solar project at Nellis Air Force Base (AFB) was based on the following commercial arrangements: . Nellis AFB has leased acres of property to a special purpose entity called Solar Star NAFB, LLC, owned and operated by MMA Renewable Ventures, for a period of twenty years beginning January following the start of commercial operation for the project; . Solar Star NAFB has in turn agreed to sell the power output of the plant to Nellis AFB for a coincident term; . Solar Star NAFB has also agreed to sell the renewable energy credits (RECs)--the tradable credits representing the environmental attributes, benefits and other values of renewable energy--to Nevada Power for the same -year term. Nevada Power purchases such credits in order to comply with the Renewable Portfolio Standard required under Nevada's Renewable Energy Law; . On behalf of Solar Star NAFB, MMA Renewable Ventures negotiated an engineering, procurement, and construction contract (EPC Contract) with PowerLight Corporation, which is now SunPower Corporation, Systems (SunPower). Under the EPC Contract, SunPower purchased more than , solar modules and inverters, constructed the tracking systems, assembled racks of modules, transported equipment, arranged labor on the site, and interconnected all the system components; . On behalf of Solar Star NAFB, MMA Renewable Ventures arranged for construction financing from Merrill Lynch, debt financing from John Hancock Insurance Company, and equity financing from CitiCorp North America, Allstate Insurance Company, and MMA Financial. The sum total of these complex legal and financial arrangements enabled the construction of the largest PV plant in North America. While the specifics of each party and arrangement may vary from project to project, we believe that this public-private partnership model provides a commercial approach that can be used at a variety of sites of varying size and scale. Recommendations for Promoting Utility-Scale Solar Projects Utility-scale solar projects represent the greatest opportunity for solar electric generation technologies to reach cost parity with conventional gas and coal-fueled electric generation. When equipment, labor, and capital are deployed to build solar projects at a scale counted in tens of megawatts, gains from economies of scale including the spread of transaction costs can deliver lower cost solar power. Additionally, this will spur the cost efficiencies required to make the deployment of distributed generation more competitive with retail electricity rates requiring minimal subsidies. In order to promote the development of projects of such scale, project developers and financial entities need to have a relatively stable financial, legal, and regulatory environment. All fuel-less electric generation technologies are more capital intensive than conventional combustion-based technologies, requiring long-term stability in the business environment to mobilize capital. The following concepts/initiatives are key to the development and financing of utility-scale solar: . Long-Term Federal Tax Incentives The current percent investment tax credit (ITC) for solar projects expires at the end of . At present, these federal incentives are critical to the development and financing of utility- scale solar projects. Without the federal tax benefits, utility-scale solar projects will not be viable because the cost of energy will simply be too high. The effectiveness of existing incentives is significantly limited in driving development of utility scale projects with long lead time particularly given the pace of development and consumer adoption of energy technologies. The existing tax credits or incentives are short- term, piecemeal programs subject to the uncertainty of the Congressional reauthorization and/or appropriations processes. For example, the production tax credit for wind and other types of renewable energy, established in , has been subject to three expirations and several short-term extensions (some retroactive). Uncertainty around the ITC extension increases the cost of capital due to the risk of meeting a deadline and leads to a boom and bust cycle which has caused the inflation of equipment costs purely from supply constraints. Congress should pass a long-term ITC to drive substantial private sector investment in clean energy technologies. Investors need stable, long-term, and predictable incentives. MMA Renewable Ventures supports a minimum seven-year timeframe for clean energy tax credits because this is the minimum period necessary to enable rational investment decisions and deployment of resources in utility scale projects. The federal regulatory environment's support for energy technologies can be significantly improved by establishing consistency and predictability. At the bottom line, those of us who are actually building and financing utility-scale solar projects need greater certainty of the federal tax benefits. In addition, the ITC could benefit from the amendment of several rules within the IRS code: Eliminate the basis adjustment so that one-half of ITC is not ``recaptured''; Make renewable energy investments eligible for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) consideration. Structured correctly, this could serve to catalyze both distributed and utility-scale solar projects in low and moderate-income communities and/or serving public facilities. It would also serve to attract additional institutional investors into the space and help to create ``green-collar'' jobs in lower-income communities; Create an ``economic substance'' carve-out for solar tax credits similar to what was done for low-income housing tax credits; Raise the production tax credit (PTC) for solar to make it competitive with the ITC and give investors a choice of either one. The PTC structure is a better fit for some investors and will encourage more capital to enter the solar space; Match the residual value exemption currently available to the low income housing sector, allowing for no constraints at resale after the tax benefits have been monetized; Abolish the possibility for ITC recapture in the event of a catastrophic loss without replacement by the end of a calendar year; Allow tax equity to enter project after the system as reached commercial operation under any financing structure. . A Stable Legal Framework One of the important prerequisites for investors in utility-scale solar projects is certainty the commercial arrangements will remain intact for the full term of the financing. Utility purchasers, commissions, and State and federal regulations all need to provide certainty and assurances that the various commercial arrangements will not materially change throughout the life of the project. For instance, in reviewing the standard contracts proposed for the Nellis AFB project it was determined that certain elements in the site lease and the streams of revenues from the power purchase arrangement with Nellis AFB and the REC Agreement with Nevada Power made the project somewhat less than financeable. The most significant instance involved the change-in-law risk associated with the REC agreement. If the Public Utility Commission of Nevada had not issued an order that approved the contract and an associated stipulation that provided assurances regarding change-in-law risk, the project might not have been financed. . A National Renewable Portfolio Standard Today, renewable energy resources provide a fraction of total U.S. energy, with the potential for significant growth. More than twenty- seven states and the District of Columbia utilize a wide variety of renewable portfolio standard (RPS) mechanisms to drive a greater reliance on renewable energy. A basic RPS requires the electric utilities (investor-owned utilities and publicly-owned utilities) within a state to procure a percentage of their electricity output necessary to meet load from renewable energy sources in a specified timeframe. Current State policies require varying percentages of renewables, typically targeting a goal of one percent to five percent in the first year, increasing each year to achieve a goal of five percent to percent over approximately - years. In general, a utility can meet RPS requirements by incorporating renewable energy into its fuel mix in one of four ways: ( ) building renewable energy facilities; ( ) purchasing power directly from an existing renewable energy source; ( ) buying RECs; or ( ) by encouraging production of distributed renewable energy, efficiency, or conservation. The specifics of each RPS program vary widely state to state from the goal, to the criteria, to the method of implementation. Many State programs set standards for specific technologies to ensure diversity of electricity supply by supporting the development of promising technologies that may not currently be the most economic. A national RPS would set the minimum standard for wholesale renewable energy usage throughout the United States. This would serve the important function of guaranteeing a minimum degree of market demand for renewable energy generation. Every state would be required to develop an energy regulatory strategy that includes a base level RPS with performance-based metrics that would drive investment in, and adoption of, viable, cost-effective renewable energy technologies. Specifically, Congress would mandate the establishment of minimum State renewable energy procurement standards with ample flexibility for State programs that surpass the federal minimum standards, encouraging dissemination of best regulatory and utility procurement practices, and providing states with incentives to increase reliance on renewable energy, reward energy efficiency, and to provide for a national REC market. For the reasons stated previously regarding stability, it is important that a national RPS is cognizant of existing State programs to ensure long-term investments already undertaken are not adversely affected. The federal RPS would require sufficient non-compliance measures in order to provide a strong incentive for utility compliance. A national RPS can be a market driving, demand side solution for addressing the broader goals of energy policy through development of diverse, secure renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, while at the same time encouraging technological advances throughout the energy supply chain. The future of renewable energy production in the United States resides in this synergy of governmental policy and emerging technologies--and without each, the aim of diversified, sustainable, and efficient energy production is simply impossible in the foreseeable future. By setting these aggressive goals for renewable energy production targets, the government will drive innovation and the market will create solutions. . Valuing Carbon Emissions and Other Externalities The current cost of conventional fossil-fuel electricity does not include the environmental and social costs associated with the emission of carbon, mercury, and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Either a cap-and-trade system or emission specific taxes would complement long- term subsidies and the establishment of minimum market demand by internalizing the impact of burning fossil fuels into the price of electricity. This would tend to make solar energy more competitive with fossil fuel-fired electricity and further boost investment. Market Differences in the Southwest The southwestern portion of the U.S. including California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico has the strongest solar resource in the country. The State of Nevada has an RPS-driven REC market that provides a large part of the economics for the Nellis solar project. The RPS rules for the state have specific requirements for solar and applies a multiplier to RECs (termed Portfolio Energy Credits under the Nevada RPS) produced by solar facilities. RPS programs in the other three states exist, but are not necessarily structured properly for significant market penetration of utility-scale solar projects. California California has catalyzed solar development through the California Solar Initiative (CSI) program which utilizes a short-term production based incentive. This direct subsidy has spurred the development of distributed generation projects (mostly less than one megawatt), but is not applicable for utility-scale projects. It is expected that California will introduce a tradable REC program for the existing state RPS in the near future that will encourage distributed generation projects currently suffering from subsidy levels declining faster than capital costs for key equipment. California utilities have utilized a request for offer (RFO) process fulfilling their RPS requirements. Since there is no solar set-aside, most of these contracts have been awarded to other renewable technologies that are currently more cost effective than solar. Contracts which have been awarded to solar projects under the RFO process have largely gone to earlier stage solar technologies that have yet to be implemented. The California Public Utilities Commission recently announced a feed-in tariff based on the a revised calculation methodology for the ``market price referent'' that sets the ceiling price for contracts awarded in the RFO process. The new methodology attempts to take into account the time-of-use benefits associated with the solar production curve matching well with the state-wide demand in California. The current consensus is that the announced feed-in tariff does not provide adequate levels of compensation for solar PV projects. Arizona There are certain regulatory hurdles that impede the development of solar and other clean technologies in Arizona. Low energy rates and tariff structures that do not adequately incentivize the peak-producing benefit of solar negatively impacts the economics of solar. Net- metering policies are essential to opening up the market to more wide- spread adoption, instead of limiting potential customers only to those who have day operations, and large load centers. Under the current net-metering rules only small systems are rewarded, otherwise solar generation that exceeds on-site usage is not compensated for. Like net- metering, interconnection standards must be standardized across the state and have a minimum of MW to sufficiently promote industry adoption. Lastly the available incentives are insufficient. APS has taken the lead in establishing a PBI program, which is an important step, and for the most part well-designed ( year PBI structure), however the total available funding is only enough to fund a few MW per year--which is not enough to entice the solar PV industry to undertake the cost and risk of entering a new market. New Mexico New Mexico has shown true leadership in the aggressive RPS goals and high net metering limits. This includes solar specific requirements that must be fulfilled beginning in . The law also includes a ``Reasonable Cost Threshold'' which limits the payment of power from solar installations to currently unfinanceable levels. Conclusion Investors are beginning to respond to the market driving incentives for solar energy provided by Federal and State governments. The Nellis AFB project is a great example of how these types of incentives can be combined to create a viable project opportunity when a third-party can enter and efficiently monetize the tax benefits. These types of projects will only reach the volumes required to significantly reduce the cost of solar energy if the incentive programs are structured to ensure the creation of a stable, long-term market for project developers, installers, equipment manufacturers, and investors. The geographic market for these opportunities could be expended greatly through several actions at the federal level including a national RPS and the adoption of a market mechanism for internalizing the external costs of emissions from conventional sources of energy.

Discussion Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Kastner. We appreciate the testimony from all of our witnesses, and now we are going to turn the floor over to the Members of the Committee to have a chance to ask you some questions. I know that Mr. Hall has to leave shortly after : , so I believe if I can get my questions in first, Mr. Hall, then we will move to you, and I know you have to catch your plane. In terms of the technology on the table, it is set for a briefer period than the five minutes, so what we will do is, halfway through you will see the light turn on, but when you see it getting orange and then red, if you can please either close up the questions, we'd like to be able to move rapidly through a round of questions. The Grand Solar Plan: Jobs and Economic Benefits So, I would actually like to kick off with Mr. Hansen, who talked about the Grand Solar Plan. For those individuals who have not had a chance to read the ``Scientific American'' article, we can provide that through the office here, and I will make sure that Members of the Committee have access to it as well, although I believe that most Members have had a chance to read it. It is very compelling. But, there we go, that is the front cover. There we go. I would like to dig a little bit deeper in terms of the economic benefit. You talked a lot about what it would bring in terms of the energy, and the power, and sustainability, but could you speak a little bit in terms of jobs and actual dollars? Mr. Hansen. Madam Chairman, I tried to pack about years worth of information into five minutes, so it was difficult. The Solar Grand Plan, looking from the year to , is the period when the incentives, the subsidies so to speak, to help move the technology forward, would be needed. It is our belief that after that those technologies would be compatible economically with traditional generation methodologies--coal, natural gas, et cetera. So, beyond the economics would look very similar to how the current economic situation is for development of new electrical generation. Between now and that point in time, I believe our study indicated there would be about , jobs that would be generated. And, really, we are looking for the Abengoa type of projects to be part of this Solar Grand Plan. There would be some additional drilling required, some people that would be required to additionally add that capacity for storage in the ground, but that would be, again, existing technology, it would provide more jobs for the natural gas drillers, if you will, to provide that kind of storage in the future. All of the details have not been shaken out yet, we need more time to be able to put it together. We actually do have another paper coming out. It is out for peer review at the present time, that will have more information of the details of how many jobs and where those jobs would be located. The transmission system, the energy storage systems, they will not be just in the U.S. southwest, they will be throughout the United States. So, it will bring benefits to all of the United States, not just the southwest. Nellis Air Force Base Partnership Ms. Giffords. And, going back to Mr. Kastner, and I want to just make it clear for everyone who understands, that Nellis Air Force Base launched in a public/private partnership not more than a couple of years ago, and I believe it took you about a year to complete this project. But, percent of the energy consumed on Nellis Air Force Base is now powered by solar energy, which is extraordinary when you think about a very short period of time and ability to move so quickly in that. The Mayor and I will be visiting Nellis Air Force Base in a couple of weeks, and we will be bringing members of the community along with us as well. But, can you talk a little bit about, from a policy standpoint, several of us are from the southwest, from southwestern states, you know, what did it really take in terms of leadership to be able to implement that project, tax credits, and how you can see that expanding in different states as well? Mr. Kastner. Yes. I mean, the key driving force for the economics is the renewable energy credit contract with Nevada Power, and that was really catalyzed by the renewable portfolio standard within Nevada that requires a certain amount of solar to be produced within the state. Nevada Power issued an RFP for qualifying for these contracts before the Nellis project, during the conception of the Nellis project, and that is what, you know, really brought it forward, provided an RFP by the Air Force to do the project, knowing that this contract was available. International Competition in Solar Energy Ms. Giffords. And, a general question I want to address to Ms. Maracas, and to Ms. Rauluk. I see behind you we have some representatives from the Solon AG Company, a German company that has been investing here in southern Arizona, and I want to thank you for that. I know that the United States southwest is now competing, not just with areas like Nevada, or California, or New Jersey, but we are now competing with different countries as well. Can you please touch on some of that international competition, and how we here, you know, in the United States are going to be able to be a major player , , , years from now? Ms. Maracas. Yes. I think that is a very relevant question, and it is worth adding, I think, that one of the reasons that large-scale companies like Abengoa, Bright Source, Solar Millennium and others, are now coming into the U.S. market, is because there have been over recent years a number of very favorable policies in European markets that have really spurred activity. In Spain, there is a feed-in tariff that is, essentially, a guaranteed something like Euro cents per kilowatt hour that is paid to anybody who generates megawatts, or less than megawatts, and just, essentially, develops a project that goes into the nationalized grid in Spain. So, of course, with that kind of an incentive, lots and lots of activity has been spurred in the Spanish marketplace. Other countries in Europe have similar measures, and the markets are growing rapidly in those countries. Well, that has enabled companies to, like I just mentioned, to develop economies of scale, achieve technology advancements, and make the technology more affordable in the U.S. market. As Mark pointed out earlier, we have the best solar resource on the planet. In all of Spain, Spain's solar resource would not have even shown up on Mark's map. And so, and I am quite serious, this is about . , is that right, is kind of the high number that they strive for in Spain, compared to the . or eight kilowatt hours per square meter today that we have in this area in our home state. So, the combination of a really desirable solar resource in the southwestern states, and, particularly, our home state, that and the credible developers who are not coming into the marketplace, I think create a really good recipe for expanded growth here. Ms. Giffords. Okay, thank you. And briefly, Ms. Rauluk. Ms. Rauluk. I think it is important to remember, it is useful to have a feed in tariff or something that provides the extra value for the kilowatt hour that is produced from solar energy. That is a needed link in the marketplace. And, that is why Europe has really gone beyond what we have done in the U.S., because their value attributed to the kilowatt hours is significantly higher than it is in the United States. But, I think we have to remember that who pays that, because that dollar amount for the extra value that you are paying for has to come from the rate payers, effectively, and there is really a limit to how much you can ask the rate payers to pay. In Europe, it was a little bit easier. First of all, they have fundamentally higher electricity rates. So, if you are adding a penny to the kilowatt hour it is not a or percent increase, but it is, you know, less than that, and also the electric power industry is structured a little more simply. So, my greatest concern is, I would love to see that the incentives available in the United States would be in excess of . , . cents a kilowatt hour, you would get massive amounts of solar energy put in place. But, fundamentally, somebody has to pay, and, you know, how do we do that, and that is something we really need to think about. Thank you. Ms. Giffords. Thank you. Mr. Hall. Why Does Solar Energy Need So Much Assistance? Mr. Hall. I guess to follow up, Ms. Rauluk, why does solar need so much assistance to be a viable source of energy? Ms. Rauluk. Well, sir, there is a couple of reasons, one of which is that you are paying for all of your fuel up front, so that is the number one thing. But, fundamentally, the solar energy industry is relatively small compared to other energy industries and scale really, really is important. So, the incentive structure, the way it has always been envisioned, and this is something that we have been doing in the U.S. for the last five to eight years, the incentive structure is to bring the scale of the industry and all of the manufacturing efficiencies, et cetera, et cetera, to bear on the problem and bring the cost down. And, basically, we are realizing, though, efficiencies in both cost and performance, and this is a relatively medium-term incentive structure that we are talking about, and I would like to point out that there is not an energy system on the planet that has not been heavily incentivized because it is an important matter. We need to have reliable energy sources. So, to do this for solar is really no different than what we have done for oil and gas, and I could go on into the list. Mr. Hall. Well, I guess I was listening for you to say the reward would be great if we really could conquer this solar thrust, but you know the cost of solar energy can, if I was listening to the testimony right, can only come down and become competitive if the Federal Government, through carbon regulation, forces fossil fuels higher. Is that what I am hearing? Is that your recommendation? Ms. Rauluk. Actually, I think in some markets solar energy is competitive right now. If you have a market where peak power prices are in excess of . -. cents a kilowatt hour, which they are in some markets, there are ways that you can put the installation together where it actually is fairly cost effective. Mr. Hall. I think the rewards would really be great if and when we can conquer the problems with solar energy. It is unlimited, the reward would be unlimited. But, I see across this country a major war against fossil fuels at this time. I am from a fossil fuel state. Texas is one of ten states that produces energy for the other states. I see a thrust toward knocking out fossil fuels. If we knocked out fossil fuels, even in the next five years, these lights go out on us. We get percent of our energy from countries that don't like us. Our goal ought to be toward trying to lessen that percentage so we are not dependent on people that hate us and fly our airplanes into our buildings to kill our people. We need to really be addressing that, and solar can really help to do that, if we could find the money to put in there. But, I do not think we can find it by knocking down fossil fuels, when it is all we have now, and all we get from Saudi Arabia, percent of our energy comes from them, is solely, totally, completely fossil fuels. I think if we are going to declare war on something, we need to declare war through technology, finding cleaner fossil fuels and finding a way to do better while we seek solar. I am very fond of solar, and I think it has unlimited possibilities. Mr. Mehos, in your testimony you indicate that without the continuation of the investment tax credit new capacity is going to be delayed by about to years. How quickly do you think the capacity could be developed if the tax credits were extended? I know you cannot say it is going to be six years, days, and hours, but just give me a good estimate of it. Mr. Mehos. I think the best answer to that is to look at what Arizona Public Service and Abengoa are doing with the megawatt project. That plant probably has a construction period of, oh, let us say around two years, not knowing that specifically. But, with the investment tax credit, if that begins to roll along, what we will see are those sizes of plants being built yearly, and probably multiples of those plants. So, if I had to guess, I would say megawatts to a gigawatt per year, even in the near-term, and let us say the near-term is in that five to , once we get past this four- year threshold, then every year after that megawatts to a gigawatt or more per year. Mr. Hall. In your testimony you also indicate that without the tax credit, solar would not be very competitive with conventional energy plants for quite a while. Should the tax credit not be available, what do you envision the cost to consumers would be compared to conventional sources of energy that we have right now? Mr. Mehos. Without the investment tax credit, using concentrating solar power as a proxy for solar, and it is probably the least cost technology of those at this point, the conventional cost from our concentrating solar power plant is probably on the order of . or. cents, let us say, a kilowatt hour, without the investment tax credit. If we compare that to conventional technology in the intermediate load markets, that is about a percent capacity factor. For a combined cycle plant, you are probably looking at . or . cents per kilowatt hour. So, we are looking at, roughly, or percent higher. Environmental Effects of Using Solar Power Mr. Hall. Ms. Lockwood, I think my time is about up. In your testimony, you indicate that since the Federal Government is the largest landowner in the United States we should study the use of available land resources for CSP development. Now, what are the effects to the environment from the use of solar power? Ms. Lockwood. Congressman Hall, the effects to the environment depend on the particular location that you are in. The most obvious and clear impact is the amount of land that is consumed. We are fortunate here in the desert southwest that we have large tracts of unused land that is very well suited for solar power. We certainly have to consider homes of exotic species and other types of environmental impacts when you are looking at siting solar, but we have large tracts of land that are very well suited for this technology today. Mr. Hall. The use of all of these aides to the pursuit of solar power, you mentioned that, and I would ask you, would you support the use of closed military bases, you know, BRAC closes a lot of bases around the country, I think every years, and this is just a suggestion to you to be thinking about, because you seem to be championing that. Do you support the use of closed military bases for development of large-scale solar projects? Ms. Lockwood. Congressman Hall, I believe that is a perfectly valid opportunity for putting that land to use. Mr. Hall. I know BRAC has a provision for refineries being built where you lose a BRAC. I don't know what your State law is, what BRAC closed down for the State of New Mexico, but we lost several in Texas, and they were cut down all over the United States. Ms. Giffords. Mr. Hall, we do not allow them to close in southern Arizona either, and you realize that. Mr. Hall. Yes, I know you would not allow that. You get the pitch forks out. But, we put a provision in there. EPA is the major problem to getting permits to do things, and we had a provision in there at one time that if we made a request to EPA and they did not deny it in days it was granted. And, I know you would like that, wouldn't you? We liked that. I don't think it made it through the Senate--very little gets through the Senate nowadays. But that is a good way to get refineries. Refineries are the reason gas is going higher; there are no refineries. Companies like Exxon and others do not want to put money into it, it takes or years to get their money back. EPA would do nothing and we cannot appeal from nothing. So, we would rather have them turn us down in days, and then we can appeal it, or grant it in days and you go on with it. That is something that you might think about as you support the use of closed military bases, because I agree with you on that. I think my time is up. I wish I had more. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Hall. Vice Chairman Lipinski. Increasing the Efficiency of Solar Cells Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Chairwoman. First of all, I want to note that it is good to see, we have almost as many engineers on this panel as we have in the House of Representatives. I am one of the few engineers in the House. I also notice we have two Stanford alums here--I have an engineering degree from Stanford--and one from Berkeley unfortunately. But, I want to start out in a little different direction in terms of the technology involved right now, and where we are going with that. I co-hosted a nanotechnology showcase a couple weeks ago in Washington to see some of the new products that are coming out using nano technology. And, I know at the University of Illinois they have done some work and found that by placing silicon nano particles onto silicon solar cells they can increase the power by about percent and increase the life of the cell. Where is this work right now, in terms of improving PV cells, and how much of a difference is that going to make in the near future, near to short-term, to mid-range future, in terms of how efficient solar energy is? Whoever wants to tackle that one. Mr. Hansen. Mr. Hansen. I will try to take that one, thank you. TEP did invest in a manufacturing company, Global Solar, and I was involved in the technology looking for that, so I have some background in photovoltaics. In fact, I have a preference for photovoltaics as opposed to concentrating solar power. You know, back in , when silicon and gallium arsenide were used to develop photovoltaics, they were the predominant metals, if you will, for the use at that time. Since then, we now have those and efficiencies have improved from the less than one percent in to the to percent for silicon- based. Gallium arsenide-based are now almost at percent, and we do have some materials over percent efficiency. The--are more for silicon and sigs of copper--desalinate have all improved their efficiencies over the last decade. All the work with global solar weighs efficiency for long-scale production runs from two percent to over percent. So, all of these technologies are improving. I think we need to be careful not to focus on the efficiency when we talk about utility-scale, but to focus on cost per installed kilowatt. We have a lot of land in Arizona. I do not live in Tucson, I live in Apache County in the northeastern part of Arizona, when I travel from my home to our coal-fired power plant, and our solar plant, we have about . megawatts of solar photovoltaics there, I pass by approximately square miles of land that has about, as I like to say, eight bushes and one house on it, and there is a lot of room, it is fairly flat land. We have space in Arizona. Efficiency deals with space. Cost is going to be the driver. We need to be improving efficiency, but we need to keep our eye and our focus on reducing the costs. The nano technologies that are now being developed, and some of the organic dye technologies as well, and some of the more advanced thin films, do show promise to be able to reduce the cost of the photovoltaics to dramatically lower numbers, talking in numbers that are less than a dollar per watt, whereas, conventional technologies today are typically at the module level in the neighborhood of $ to $ a watt, some as low as $ . . This is what will drive the cost, and that is really the issue on photovoltaics, is the cost. We need to bring the cost down. Ms. Rauluk. I would like to mention a couple of things. First of all, and I am not an expert in all of the technology improvements and innovations that are in the pipeline right now, but just from my discussions and work with my colleagues at the University of Arizona and Raytheon Missile Systems, these folks have viable technologies that are, I would call it, in the final stages of R&D. So, there are some very exciting and interesting things in the PV, the concentrating PV, or CPV, and the highly-concentrated PV area that are coming out of the laboratory. Now, there are incremental changes, incremental improvements that are happening with PV, and when people look at, well, what is the efficiency and the cost, and how is this all working out, no one is thinking about, well, what is coming out of the labs, because the commercialization process is a difficult process with some uncertainties attached to it. But, let me just point out that, you know, a lot of people say, well, let us not do anything until the technology is really great, and then we will just go and one of the things that supports the technology in the labs right now is the recognition of a marketplace existing and viable. So, when these technologies are coming out of the lab, which I expect they will within the next three years, they will need to get financed by venture capital and then second-stage financing, et cetera, et cetera, and people are going to look at that and say, well, where is the market? So, even if we have a good technology, it is important that we do not wait until we get these things coming out of the labs, but that we have a systematic and reliable investment plan for the future. Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. I see a red light, and I will yield back. If we have a second round, I will have another question. Ms. Giffords. Okay, thank you. Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. Ms. Giffords. Mr. Matheson. Accelerated Technology Innovation Mr. Matheson. Well, thank you. I am not an engineer. I am, my background is in finance, but I used to be an independent power developer, and developed co-generation facilities. And, now I sit in Congress, where we try to come up with public policy ideas to help foster these new technologies. And, it seems to me that we need to be looking at this on a couple of different paths at the same time. I have heard all the witnesses talk about the need for, lack of a better term, federal subsidies to help create large-scale commercial applications of technology. What I am curious about is another path that we also ought to be talking about, I think, and that is the notion of how do we get these technologies to be more efficient so that they are commercially viable, perhaps, with less subsidies, or, perhaps, with no subsidies. And, Mr. Mehos, your last slide, at the end of your presentation, the kick-starting utility-scale solar slide, you mentioned that there is an exercise for DOE that is estimated at $ million a year to achieve the accelerated goals. And, that was what I was wondering about, is that program. It sounds to me, you can confirm this for me, but DOE has identified a path to help accelerate this technological innovation, and I think as Members of the Science Committee that is, obviously, something we have great interest in as well. So, can you share with us a little bit about what that accelerated effort entails? Mr. Mehos. Sure. The accelerated effort, as I briefly mentioned, in along two paths. It is continued technology development on the specific technologies, trying to achieve higher temperatures, and I will describe that in a second. The two technologies in the concentrating solar power program that achieve these higher temperatures are the line focused parabolic trough technologies and the more point- focused central receiver technologies, as well as the point- focused disturling technologies. But, of those first two, the parabolic trough and the central receiver technologies, going to higher temperatures achieves a couple of things. One, it allows you to operate your cycle at higher efficiencies, that does decrease the levelized cost of energy. As importantly, or maybe even more important, as you go to the higher temperatures we are dealing with high amounts of thermal storage materials having a higher delta T difference between your hot temperature and your cold temperature to work with, significantly decreases the amount of thermal storage that you are working with, and that, in itself, also decreases the cost of thermal storage, or of the levelized cost of energy. So, those are two of the higher pathways, higher temperature pathways, that lower your cost. We are working on a number of other avenues. We are looking at higher temperature materials, higher reflectivity materials, better absorbing, less emitting materials. We had a study some time ago now, I think back around with Sergeant Inlundy, basically, identified three mechanisms for reducing the cost of solar power, none of which were power peaked. The first one is the research I described. That results in about a percent reduction in the cost of electricity. The second one is just increasing the size of your plant, the type of work that APS and Abengoa are working on, going from smaller to megawatts. And, the last one is learning, it is deployment, and the more you deploy these technologies, actually, this does get into policy, then the lower the cost of the technology over time. Financing Technology Development Mr. Matheson. And, is it fair to say that, I mean, obviously, one of the variables that helps this process go is if Congress appropriates the funds so that this effort can happen. Dollars, you know, money is part of making this technology develop. Mr. Mehos. Yes. Mr. Matheson. Are there other policy options that also need to be considered or adjusted that Congress hasn't done that could help facilitate the development of these technologies? Mr. Mehos. Yes, I believe so. I think in project finance one of the key issues is risk. When we start talking about $ to $ billion projects, I mean, the risk associated with that is relatively high. The parabolic trough technology is actually fairly low risk, but still project finance can be an issue. And, as you look toward some of these higher temperature technologies, like the central receiver, or the disturling technology as an example, the policy of loan guarantees, or federal loan guarantees, comes to play there. Mr. Matheson. Okay, that is helpful. One other slide that I wanted to ask you about. You showed the difference of whether the percent ITC is extended or not, and the roll out of solar technology. It is probably impossible for you to estimate, because we do not have a policy in place yet in this country, but did you consider if the cap on trade program is put in, and there is a price associated with the carbon, how that would affect the curve when you are developing those drafts? Mr. Mehos. No, that's a good question, and we have considered it, we do not have the ability to model that yet. Mr. Matheson. Yes. Mr. Mehos. That is one of our outcomes this year, we will be able to model those types of systems. Mr. Matheson. Mr. Hansen, this is a little off target, but you mentioned smart grid when you were talking, and, you know, the Congress just passed smart grid legislation in the energy bill that passed last year. Do you feel like the legislation that Congress passed was helpful for smart grid? Are there other things we should be doing beyond what was in that legislation, or do you have any thoughts on that? Mr. Hansen. Good question. What you passed is very helpful. It is a good start. What we need now is additional, kind of what Valerie just alluded to, we need scale. That is up to the utilities. Over time, over working with our individual State regulatory entities, we will be able to get recovery for those additional costs. Mr. Matheson. Right. Mr. Hansen. I think the Federal Government has stepped up to the plate and given us the tools that we need from the federal level. I think we now need State level to step up to the plate. So, I appreciate the efforts you had last year. Thank you. Mr. Matheson. Great. Thanks. Madam Chair, I see my time is expired. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Matheson. Mr. Mitchell. Land Usage for Solar Power Mr. Mitchell. Thank you. One of the things that was mentioned earlier was that to be successful large-scale solar facilities need land, and the Solana project is three square miles. Is there any possibility that we can be able to, with technology, lessen the need of land? You know, also mentioned was that the reason that there was a market in the southwest for solar was because we had the land, and that we had high renewable portfolio standards. One of the fights we had over this last energy bill was over the national portfolio standards, and it was knocked out mainly because there were states that said they really didn't have the land, or they didn't have the sunshine, and as a result the portfolio standards are really out here in the southwest. Is there anything we can do maybe to help establish a higher portfolio standard nationwide at the same time maybe not use as much land as we are going to be able to use here? Anybody. Mr. Hansen. If I may, again, going back to the question asked earlier about efficiency, improving the efficiency, raising the efficiency of photovoltaics, raising the temperature of the collection on concentrating solar, will reduce the amount of land that is required. Every state has the ability to produce some level of solar. There was a study done a few years back by Black and Beech on the State of Pennsylvania. I went to school in the State of Pennsylvania, I grew up in New Jersey. I don't remember seeing the sun a whole lot of the time, but, quite frankly, the result of that study indicated that the only renewable resource that could meet all of the energy needs of Pennsylvania was solar. So, every state does have the ability to put in solar. The roof tops are available, without having to use any land. There is a wide range of solar technologies available. TEP's experience is with about of those at this present time, and what we have found is that different technologies have advantages in different climatic zones, as I said in my written testimony. All of the technologies need to be developed, so that we, as a United States, have a portfolio of opportunities. We, as utilities, can pick and choose among these different technologies as to what is most appropriate for our state. I am not going to weigh in on the issue of a national renewable energy standard. I think the State of Arizona has stepped up to the plate and done an excellent job leadership- wise in developing one that is appropriate for Arizona. But, I do think that over time, with the federal level support, with the national labs, and with universities, the funding can be provided to improve the efficiency, to improve the overall storage capability, for energy in the future that is going to drive things like the solar, Grand Solar Plan and these other technologies to economic fruition, so that they will, in fact, become economically compatible with coal and natural gas. Ms. Rauluk. One of the reasons why distributed generation has value is that you don't need really large contiguous pieces of land. And, in fact, you can, Mr. Hansen already mentioned, you can put photovoltaics on roof tops, but you can also put photovoltaics in smaller pieces of land and every community has pieces of land that may be old industrial sites, next door to an old industrial site, maybe it is a buffer for an airport, whatever, that are not, you know, several square miles, but are maybe a half a square mile, or even less than that, and you can use that land for a distributed application, because it can scale down to that. So, I think that the amount of contiguous land doesn't really constrain us when we are talking about a distributed format, and there are plenty of opportunities to do that. Price of ``Green'' Power Mr. Mitchell. One last question, maybe this is Ms. Lockwood. You know, some people pay an extra little premium to encourage green production of power. Is there any way that anybody is going to take advantage of that once Solana comes on line, or is it all just going to the grid and everybody still pays the same price? Ms. Lockwood. Congressman Mitchell, we very much believe in the power of our customers to drive the policy and our resource choices. So, absolutely. Solana is several years away, but we do envision a way that our customers can choose to pay a small premium and have all or part of their energy served by Solana. Ms. Giffords. We only have a few more minutes left, and since I am going to afterwards ask our witnesses to come up, I am going to defer my questions, maybe just one additional question from each of the Members before you have to leave. Utility-Scale Versus Distributed Generation Mr. Lipinski. Yes, I will lead off here. I just want to know, we are in heaviest discussion here about utility-scale mostly, but also distributed generation. Is there any conflict or tension between the two, in terms of one obviating the need for the other? I just want to throw that out there and see some smiles on faces about this. It must be something that you deal with regularly. Mr. Hansen. If I may, they can be compatible with each other. TEP's studies have indicated that for us to produce percent of our annual energy from solar we need about , megawatts of solar installed. If every home in Tucson were to have about a three kw system, which is realistic in size, that would give us about that megawatts of solar. It is at about that point when the energy storage becomes a critical component, if we are going to move solar beyond that percent of our annual energy. That is why TEP has always been trying to develop a balance of distributed generation as well as utility-scale. Even if every home in Tucson were to install nine kilowatts of photovoltaics, that is percent of our energy. The other has to come from someplace, and we are proposing, at least I am proposing in the long-term, that that comes from the utility-scale solar, such as the megawatt system that Abengoa is planning to put in. But, it could also be from photovoltaics. In the long-term, the two systems have to mesh, and the glue that makes them mesh is the storage. Even distributed generation without utility-scale solar is going to require some level of storage to even out the day to night intermittencies. The other part of the puzzle that is hard to understand for some people who have not lived in the southwest is that most of the solar energy is actually produced in the springtime in Arizona, away from our monsoon storms. But, of course, most of the consumption is in the summertime, so we have to shift about three months worth of solar energy into the summertime. It actually works out to be approximately percent. One other factor I think that needs to be considered for the future, is plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Our calculations indicate that with an additional percent of energy per year we could provide all of the energy that is needed for all of the passenger vehicles in the City of Tucson. So, that does not include heavy trucks, and airplanes, and locomotives, but your normal passenger vehicles. That, again, could be derived from solar, and could provide an additional opportunity for storage if we go back to that smart grid development and how to integrate them as part of this storage philosophy. Mr. Lipinski. Ms. Rauluk. Ms. Rauluk. I have alluded to this in my spoken comments, and I have a more detailed explanation of it in my written comments, but there is a fundamental conflict right now in the way in which we contractually do these things between distributed generation and the utilities revenues, because the distributed generation is on the customer's site, and they are effectively purchasing less energy from the utility by generating their own energy. And then the question arises, well, how do you assure the preservation of utility revenues and the assets that they support, because this is not about getting rid of the utilities or getting rid of the fossil fuel generation by any means. So, there are things we need to do contractually and from a regulatory point of view, and the industry is well into the phase of doing that and creating the mechanisms that, basically, do not conflict, do not have the utility having a natural and inherent animosity towards distributed generation, but that it is a part of the whole system and is valuable for the whole system. Mr. Lipinski. Ms. Lockwood. Ms. Lockwood. Congressman Lipinski, I do not know that I disagree with anything Mr. Hansen or Ms. Rauluk said, but for us in Arizona, in particular, for APS, it is about growth, and we are growing so fast, our energy consumption is also growing so fast, that we need all resources to meet our energy needs into the future. We believe that both are required to get where we need to go, and do not believe there is a fundamental conflict. Now, there is some theory that there is only so much subsidy or incentive to go around, and I think that is where a lot of the debate comes in. Does it go to large scale, or does it go to distributed? And, that is a healthy debate. That is something that we need to be talking about. There are different economics when you look at those different sides of the issue. For utility scale, we very much look at it in comparison to the other resources that we have. Even without carbon today, large scale is getting--large-scale CSP, solar thermal--is pretty competitive. Our Solana plant is about a percent premium over our conventional resources, what we would have expected to pay for fossil fuel resources into the future for that project. On the distributed side, you look at it not what you pay for other large-scale generation, but you look at what the customer is paying and the offsets for that customer, and how that works within your rate structure also. So, from our perspective we need them all, and we need to make sure that we are looking at policies that facilitate them all in the appropriate way and the appropriate manner, also considering the economics and how the impact to the rate payer. Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. I thank all the witnesses for their testimony. It was extremely helpful today, and thanks to Congresswoman Giffords for bringing this together. Ms. Giffords. Thank you. Mr. Matheson. Compressed Air Storage and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mr. Matheson. Why, I'm nervous about going over the deadlines that Madam Chair set. Let me ask one real quick question. I have got to chance this. I was reading about the Grand Plan, and, you know, one of the great benefits of solar in a world where we are concerned about climate change and global warming is that we move away from fossil fuels. But, I did note that in the energy storage component of the Grand Plan, we are going to use compressed air, there would be some degree of natural gas used. Do you have a sense of what that means in terms of greenhouse gas emission? Mr. Hansen. The use of the natural gas for the reheat on the turbine, and this is, before I say that, this is a technology that can be changed. You can make turbines that do not have to have this natural gas input. Mr. Matheson. Oh, okay. Mr. Hansen. Alternatively, you could be using biomass or some other type of fuel, bio-diesel, et cetera, to do it, but it is approximately one-sixth of the input that otherwise would be required from natural gas or coal under a normal conventional technology. Mr. Matheson. Okay, thank you. That is it. Ms. Giffords. Thank you. Mr. Mitchell. I don't have a question. I would just like to thank everyone, because it was very informative, and not only the written material but your testimony. So, thank you all very much. Ms. Giffords. Well, before we bring this hearing to a close, I want to again thank our witnesses for the generous time and for really a very, very interesting discussion. The Science Committee is, I believe, the bipartisan Committee in Congress, and we have been able to do many things just in the last a little over a year, that I think this country would be very proud to know, if they had a chance to hear about it. Unfortunately, usually when we have committees the bells ring frequently, so we will have wonderful testimony, and then we will have to jump up, run over and vote and come back. So, what a luxury to actually have a chance to really focus on the information that you have presented before us today. The record is going to remain open for additional statements from the Members and answers to any follow-up questions the Committee may ask of our witnesses. I would also like to thank the bipartisan Science and Technology Committee staff for being here, for coming out from Washington to help conduct this hearing. Also, members from my staff, Tamarack Little, Wyatt King, Jacqueline Jackson, are just a couple that have worked so hard to bring this committee here to southern Arizona as well. I want to thank the solar experts, and there are many in the room today, and, hopefully, we will have a chance to hear from you in a couple of minutes, because we are going to ask our witnesses to come forward and to answer questions from the general public as well. But, to the public, thank you for caring so much about the future of the southwest, the future of our country, and the future of how we can take this tremendous potential, harness it, and turn it into some real energy. So, with that, the witnesses are excused and the hearing is adjourned. Thank you. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.] Appendix : ---------- Answers to Post-Hearing Questions Answers to Post-Hearing Questions Responses by Thomas N. Hansen, Vice President, Environmental Services, Conservation and Renewable Energy, Tucson Electric Power Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith Q . You spoke about the need for transmission and storage for solar energy. When built, do you envision this infrastructure would be available to other renewable energy technologies, such as wind, an important Nebraska resource? A . Most definitely. I envision a large number of storage facilities distributed around the country. The storage should ideally be located locally with respect to where the electric consumers are located, effectively on a regional basis, with one storage facility serving at most five million people. Locating underground energy storage locally provides the optimum solution for energy security for the residents in that area. The nationwide electrical transmission system would allow for the movement of wind energy produced in Nebraska to be stored in Nebraska or California or Maine. Just as our Interstate Highway System enables goods produced in one area to be efficiently delivered in another region, the interstate transmission system would efficiently enable solar, hydro, wind, geothermal, tidal, current and biomass energy to be moved around the Nation in a controlled manner to maximize efficiency of production and delivery. The combination of properly sized local storage with national transmission would allow management of the overall system to minimize congestion. Q . As a Member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I have a keen interest in NASA and the space program. Could solar energy collected in space be a viable source of energy for the U.S.? What are the benefits and challenges of this technology? A . This concept has been discussed for decades and is, in my opinion, technically viable although some components of the technology need to be improved in terms of reliability and efficiency. One big advantage includes better solar intensity above the atmosphere and / solar production potentially without day/night cycles or clouds to block the sun. This results in much higher specific energy production per unit area of solar collector reducing the size of the solar collector by percent or more. Building a multi square-mile solar collector in space will be challenging in terms of providing sufficient resources of material and people to a synchronous orbit. Wireless transmission of energy from space to Earth would require very accurate targeting systems and dedication of a few square miles of receivers and buffer zone on the ground to convert the beamed energy back into grid power at high efficiency. However, a large single energy receiver at the Earth end of a space solar energy collection system could be at risk from an act of terrorism, while multiple receiver zones would present more risk of component failure and resulting repair, in addition to an increase in initial cost. It also may be challenging to convince people that it is safe to live near a receiver zone. A space bound energy collector would be at greater risk of damage from collision with meteorites without protection from the atmosphere. Maintaining optimal orbital geometry to enable a space bound solar collector to keep sight of the sun at all times while also keeping its energy beam to Earth on target will be technically challenging, but not impossible. Interestingly, given that the space located solar collector would produce energy at a constant rate, energy storage would still be required to balance the constant energy input with a variable energy demand. The national transmission system would be required to allow for delivery of the space produced energy from a single, or small number of multiple, Earth side satellite energy receivers to all U.S. energy consumers. Some larger questions that still need to be answered are economic: What is the total cost of such a space located solar energy production system? What is the energy balance--will it take more energy to place the energy system in orbit and maintain it than the system will produce over its lifetime? Will more valuable jobs be created for Americans with a space bound energy collection system or a terrestrial located energy collection system? Both the space bound and terrestrial solar energy collection concepts deserve further consideration, although terrestrial solar energy collection technologies are fully developed and available commercially today. Answers to Post-Hearing Questions Responses by Valerie Rauluk, Founder and CEO, Venture Catalyst Inc. Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith Q a. You spoke about distributed generation systems, in which smaller generation systems (rooftop units and - acre land units) spread electricity generation over ``unused real estate'' and reduce risk of large scale power outages. Would the Federal Investment Tax Credit provide incentive for individuals to install smaller generation systems (e.g., rooftop units) and to become a part of a distributed generation network? If not, how could the Federal Government encourage this type of development? A a. Yes, the FTC does provide incentives for individuals interested in a distributed generation application and participating in a network. Q b. How would you envision the development of distributed generation systems? Who will pay to connect these smaller generation systems into a cohesive network? A b. In addition to extending the FTC set to expire at the end of this year, the Federal Government could further encourage such installations by setting distributed generation requirements for utilities nation- wide and to encourage incentives and research and development (especially commercialization R&D) for distributed systems and the intelligent controls and storage options that increase a DG network's value and resiliency. Q a. As a Member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I have a keen interest in NASA and the space program. Could solar energy collected in space be a viable source of energy for the U.S.? A a. Theoretically, it could be subject to resolving certain technological challenges. However, in the near-term, there are many cost-effective opportunities for harvesting solar energy on the surface of the planet. Q b. What are the benefits and challenges of this technology? A b. The chief challenge is delivering the collected solar energy to where people can use it, in electric power parlance, the ``load.'' The cost of delivering to the load from remote locations on Earth is one of the fundamental challenges and costs and is why solar energy in a distributed format is more beneficial than central station applications. Energy generation from space would create even greater costs and challenges. However, there may be some benefits to doing so. I have not reviewed the literature concerning this option and cannot offer any insights into the benefits. Answers to Post-Hearing Questions Responses by Joseph Kastner, Vice President of Implementation and Operations, MMA Renewable Ventures LLC Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith Q . As a Member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I have a keen interest in NASA and the space program. Could solar energy collected in space be a viable source of energy for the U.S.? What are the benefits and challenges of this technology? A . It is my understanding that the DOE studied the collection of solar energy with photovoltaic panels is space several decades ago. Some of the large hurdles for this idea include providing a safe, efficient means for transmitting the electricity to a terrestrial collection point (the DOE contemplated using microwaves) and the mobilization of a large-scale construction project in space (to make it worthwhile the array would be many times larger than the International Space Station). Such a large array would also be quite susceptible to space debris. Appendix : ---------- Additional Material for the Record [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] "

Present: Senators Sanders, Murray, Wyden, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Warner, Merkley, Kaine, Van Hollen, Lujan, Padilla, Graham, Grassley, Crapo, Toomey, Braun, Scott, Sasse, and Kennedy. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BERNARD SANDERS Chairman Sanders. Okay. Let me convene this hearing, the purpose of which is to speak with Ms. Shalanda Young, who has been nominated by the President to be Deputy OMB Director. And let me thank my colleague who are here with us in person. I know Chuck Grassley is in back, and others will be coming. Senator Graham is a little bit late but he will be here shortly. And we thank those who are participating remotely. We are here today to consider the nomination of Shalanda Young to become the next Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. As we all know, the OMB is responsible for preparing the President's budget, reviewing Federal regulations, and providing the proper oversight of Federal agencies. It is a very important task. For the past years, Ms. Young has served as a top staffer on the House Appropriations Committee and has done an excellent job in working with Democrats and Republicans on legislation that must be passed each and every year that impacts the lives of tens of millions, and we thank her very much for her years of public service. Today, in America, it is no great secret that we are living through one of the most difficult periods in the modern history of our country. We have a terrible crisis with the pandemic, where we have lost half a million Americans, and we are also living through a terrible economic downturn. The real unemployment rate in America today is over percent. Over million Americans are either unemployed, underemployed, or have given up looking for work. More than half of the workers in our country today, unbelievably, in the richest country on earth, are living paycheck to paycheck. That means if your car breaks down, your kid gets sick, you are facing a terrible financial emergency. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth, and we hope, by the way, to address that through the American Rescue Plan Act that we will be discussing this week on the floor of the Senate. And in the midst of all that, we have a massive level of income and wealth inequality, which this Committee actually will be discussing in the near future. The COVID- pandemic is still raging across the country and is responsible for taking the lives of some , Americans. At the same time, unbelievably, we have million Americans who are either uninsured or underinsured. In other words, we have a major health care crisis and are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people, as a human right. We have, in the midst of all of this, not just an American but a global climate crisis that threatens the well-being of the planet. We have an affordable housing crisis, where millions of people are paying half of their limited incomes on rent. Half a million people are sleeping out on the streets. We have a racial injustice crisis, and we will accelerate our effort to fight systemic racism. We have an immigration crisis that must be addressed. It has been ignored for too long. In other words, this country today faces an unprecedented set of crises that must be addressed. And guess what? A lot of those priorities, a lot of those issues are going to fall within the purview of OMB, including the Director of the OMB. Ms. Young, I look forward to working with you as the Deputy OMB Director, to enact the promises that the Biden administration has made to the American people, and that is to increase the Federal minimum wage to $ an hour; to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for working families, and to substantially reduce student debt; to lower the Medicare eligibility age, and to substantially lower prescription drugs costs in this country; to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs and combat climate change; to make pre-K universal for every - and -year-old in America, and make child care affordable to every family in this country; to make sure that every worker in America has at least weeks of paid family and medical leave; and, in fact, in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality, to make sure that the wealthiest people and the most profitable corporations start to pay their fair share of taxes. Those are not my ideas. That is what the Biden administration has been talking about. And the job of OMB and the Deputy Director of the OMB, to my mind, is to make sure that we keep faith with the American people, that we implement what the President has been talking about. So let me thank Ms. Young for being with us. I look forward to your testimony, and now let me give the microphone over to Ranking Member Lindsey Graham for his opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think you are a highly qualified person for the job. Everybody that deals with you on our side has nothing but good things to say. You might talk me out of voting for you, but I doubt it. Thank you. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Mr. Graham, for that cogent and brief remark. My colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, wants to introduce Ms. Young. Can we roll the film, so to speak. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE PATRICK LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. I am very happy to be here today to introduce Shalanda Young. She is President Biden's nominee to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Now, for the members of this Committee who also sit on the Appropriations Committee, Shalanda is a familiar face. She has worked on the House Appropriations Committee for nearly years. She has been the House Appropriations Staff Director since . Actually, it is in that capacity I had the pleasure to really get to know her well, and I can tell you, without reservation, I can think of no one better suited to be Deputy Director of OMB than Shalanda. Her deep understanding of the often arcane Federal budget process, her years of experience on the Appropriations Committee, her tenacity, her dedication to public service, her honesty will serve the agency and the American people. Shalanda began her career in public service in , at the National Institutes of Health. She came first to work on Capitol Hill as a detailee with the House Appropriation Committee in . She really made a good impression because she returned in . She worked her way up in the committee over the years. Her work in developing the budget and conducted oversight of key agencies has given her critical insights into the operation of some of our nation's most important agencies, including, of course, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, the General Service Administration. She even served as a staff director for the Legislative Branch Subcommittee overseeing the budget for Congress. Then she became Staff Director of the House Appropriations Committee in . Coincidentally, that was the same year I became Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. And since that time she has helped the House navigate some of the most difficult issues before the chamber. She has a reputation as a tough, but fair negotiator. That is high praise on Capitol Hill, and I can attest to the truth of these statements. I have seen these skills first-hand. Let me tell you a story. Shalanda was a critical figure in helping to end the government shutdown in January of . Now I remember the evening we cut the final deal to end the -day government shutdown, the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Chairman Shelby, Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Kay Granger, and I, along with only a very few but highly trusted staff, went to my office in the Capitol. We continued talks that started earlier that day. We wanted to get away from being watched by everybody, from the lobbyists, to the press, away from the cameras. We wanted to see if we could reach a deal. Fortunately, Shalanda was with us. As we worked into the night on these difficult issues, her knowledge of a vast range of Federal programs, her understanding of the political process, and her determination to get the country we love back on track helped us reach a deal. We shook hands on it that night, and we went out, the four of us--two Republicans, two Democrats--and we announced it to the press. If you look closely at pictures of that moment, Shalanda is there in the background. Hopefully she is as proud of that moment as I am. It was a difficult time for our nation, but through determination and hard work we reached a solution, and that is what Shalanda is best at. She knows how to work across the aisle to get a deal done. Her relationships with both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate will serve her well. I have heard it said that the Office of Management and Budget is one of the most powerful government agencies, that most Americans have never heard of. It is true. It wields incredible influence over not just the Federal budget but over policies that affect people's lives. We need people like Shalanda Young to help steer the agency in these important decisions. She is wonderful. Chairman Sanders. Senator Leahy, thank you very much. And now, under the rules of the Committee, nominees are required to testify under oath. Ms. Young, would you please rise. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear the testimony that you will give the Senate Budget Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Ms. Young. I do. Chairman Sanders. If asked to do so, and if given reasonable notice, will you agree to appear before this Committee in the future and answer any questions that the members of this Committee might have? Ms. Young. I do. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much. Please be seated, and we would love to hear your remarks. TESTIMONY OF SHALANDA D. YOUNG, OF LOUISIANA, TO BE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET Ms. Young. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Graham, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today as President Biden's nominee for Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I want to thank Chairman Leahy for introducing me to the Committee today. One of the joys of being Staff Director of the Appropriations Committee has been seeing the amazing relationships and results that have come from Senator Leahy, Senator Shelby, Ranking Member Granger, and my former boss, Chairwoman Lowey. I still vividly remember the same story that you just heard from Chairman Leahy, those four meeting to avert another government shutdown. We had just opened for weeks and we needed to find a deal quickly, back in February of . Even in those tense moments, Senator Leahy still took the time to show me pictures of his beloved family before announcing to the press that a compromise had been reached. I will be forever grateful for the kindness Senator Leahy has always shown, even in the most stressful environments. I am accompanied today by my parents, Loyce and Ronald Smith, who are here from Louisiana. My -year-old grandmother, who is still in Louisiana, could not make it due to COVID- precautions. I want to thank them and my extended family for their unwavering support over the years. Members of this distinguished Committee, I come before you today as someone who grew up in rural America. I spent most of my youth in Clinton, Louisiana. Back then, Clinton had a population of around , people. It is where my maternal great-grandparents lived, got married, and had my grandmother in . Somehow, even then, in the segregated South, my great- grandparents sent their child, my grandmother, to college. I am grateful they prioritized education, a commitment that has stayed in my family for generations. All families deserve to see their children have that same opportunity to pursue their potential. Another former boss of mine, Chairman Obey--and I am sorry if he ever yelled at you-- used to say a budget is your values. I share that belief, and firmly believe the Federal budget can and should help make the promise of this country real for all families, in all communities. I have spent the last years as both the Minority and Majority Staff Director of the House Appropriations Committee. I care deeply about the institution of Congress and have been very proud to serve in a position that required compromise to ensure the American people had not only a functioning government, but one that invested in their future. My work on the Appropriations Committee taught me that both sides can compromise without compromising their values, even when that means no one gets everything they want. I will forever be indebted to this institution, and if confirmed, I look forward to using my experience in the halls of Congress to ensure both branches operate with mutual respect and work toward solutions that will improve the lives of those we all serve. I am not naive about the challenges we face. Last year, I worked on the first COVID supplemental that Congress passed in March of . We were using models of past supplementals on Ebola and Zika because the full scale of the pandemic was still unclear. With COVID deaths surpassing , , our focus must remain on beating the virus, delivering immediate relief to millions of struggling Americans, and ensuring that we emerge from this crisis even stronger than we were before. If confirmed, I look forward to engaging with Members of Congress from both parties on this and other important work. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Graham, and other members of the Committee, thank you for allowing me to appear before this Committee, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Young appears on ] Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Ms. Young. Let me begin the questioning, and, in a sense, the questions I am going to ask you do not come from me, really. They come from the President, and I just wanted to make sure that you are on the same page as the President in terms of some of the most important issues facing our country. So I am going to ask you the questions and your answers can be very, very brief. The President has indicated strong support for increasing the minimum wage in our country from $ . an hour to $ . an hour. Do you agree with him? Ms. Young. Absolutely, Chairman Sanders. Chairman Sanders. The President has made clear that he wants to see public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling student debt, not completely, but making progress in canceling student debt for working families making less than $ , a year. Do you agree with that? Ms. Young. Yes, Senator Sanders. Chairman Sanders. The President has indicated that he wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare from to and expand Medicare coverage to include hearing, vision, and dental care. Is that something you support? Ms. Young. Yes, Senator Sanders. Chairman Sanders. Good. The President has indicated that he wants to see Medicare begin negotiating prices with the pharmaceutical industry to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs in America. Is that something you support? Ms. Young. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. The President has indicated that he supports guaranteeing weeks of paid family and medical leave. Is that something you support? Ms. Young. Absolutely. Chairman Sanders. Okay. The President has indicated that he supports providing universal pre-K education to every - and - year-old in the country and making child care more affordable for working families. Is that something you are comfortable with? Ms. Young. I have seen it work in my own family. Yes, sir. Chairman Sanders. Okay. The President has indicated, and we will be discussing more of that in the next several months, creating millions of good-paying jobs by investing at least $ trillion to combat climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels into renewable energy. Is that something you are comfortable with? Ms. Young. Yes, sir. Chairman Sanders. The President has indicated that he supports creating millions of additional good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, our roads, bridges, sidewalks, schools, water systems, wastewater plants, et cetera. Is that something that you are comfortable with? Ms. Young. Yes, sir, and I have worked on it a lot of my appropriations career. Chairman Sanders. Okay. Those are my questions, Ms. Young. Thank you very much. Senator Graham? Senator Graham. Thank you. What is the price tag of all that? Chairman Sanders. Uh---- Ms. Young. Senator Graham, as you know a lot of these do have high price tags. Senator Graham. Oh, just within a trillion or so, what is it? Ms. Young. It is some very important, you know---- Senator Graham. You know I am going to vote for you, but I just---- Ms. Young. I get it. It is expensive. Senator Graham. But I just want, like, people back home to know, okay, all that sounds good but, I mean, what does it cost? Ms. Young. It sounds good, but I think you have to talk about the details. So when we talk about the global cost if---- Senator Graham. Is it fair to say you cannot give me a price tag today but you will work on it and get me one later? Ms. Young. I will work on it---- Senator Graham. And give me one later? Ms. Young. --there are some details, I think there are some bipartisan nuggets in those infrastructure packages and others, I am sure we will get the opportunity to work on together. Senator Graham. Are you worried about a run on our border, southern border, if we keep changing the policies of immigration? Ms. Young. You can imagine I have spent a lot of time on this the last years, and I have spent some time down in Southern California and Texas. Senator Graham. Yeah. Ms. Young. You visit one part of the border, you have not visited another part. It is all very different, the topography. So, yeah, I believe---- Senator Graham. Well, let's just talk about policy. Forget about topography here. The Remain in Mexico policy of the Trump administration required people seeking asylum in the United States to stay in Mexico until their court date. Do you think that was a beneficial change? Ms. Young. I think there were some side effects that were not--I think of us as a country, including lack of access to counsel. Frankly, that if you are interested---- Senator Graham. Well, we are talking about waiting there until your court date. I mean, there are a million and a half, over a million person backlog in the asylum system. Are you concerned that if we go back to the old policy allowing people to be processed in the United States, released in the United States for a court date years in the future, most do not show up, that that will entice more people to come here to seek asylum? Ms. Young. Senator Graham, I think the speed in which our immigration system works is a bipartisan one. No one wants an asylum system that takes years and years and years. I think one of the unfortunate side effects of Remain in Mexico is you do take---- Senator Graham. Do you support changing that policy, eliminating it? Ms. Young. Yeah, I do think we need to, and think as the administration is taking a pause and looking to make sure we have an immigration system that works. Senator Graham. They are expecting to be , unaccompanied minors to hit our border in May. Why do you think the increase? Ms. Young. You know, I have not seen the figures you are using. I think you are well-known as someone who has reached across the aisle for solutions. The only way we are going to find any solutions in immigration is a bipartisan one. So yeah, I am concerned, but I do think there are solutions. Senator Graham. Let me just, you know, again, you are highly qualified for the job and I am going to vote for you. But, you know, Senator Sanders gave sort of a laundry list of things that you need to support, that the Biden administration is proposing. Maybe we can find common ground. Maybe we cannot. But I worked on about every gang bill there is around here for immigration, and what I see is a retreat on policies that worked. I was in Arizona a couple of weeks ago, and this time this year versus last year there has been almost a percent increase in people coming to our border. So for us to get immigration right we are going to have to turn off the magnets that draw people here and try to replace illegal immigration with legal immigration. Do you support more work visas, legal work visas for the American economy? Ms. Young. Senator Graham, there are several work visa program. I am no expert on them but I do know there are reforms in the works in the halls of Congress. There are some that need more reform than others. So yes, I do think the visa programs are necessary, but I do support congressional work on necessary reforms where they are needed, and I know a lot of that work is ongoing. Senator Graham. Do you think you are ready to be Director if that job was offered to you? Ms. Young. Senator Graham, thank you for the question. I am here nominated as Deputy Director. I hope, after today, you find me qualified for that position, and I look forward to hopefully winning your support. Senator Graham. Well, you will get my support, maybe for both jobs. Who knows. Thanks. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Graham. Now we are going to hear from Senator Murray via video. Senator Murray. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and before I begin I do want to reiterate my support for Neera Tanden's nomination to be OMB Director. I have known and worked closely with Neera for many years. So whether you agree with her on every issue or not, you cannot question her passion, her knowledge, her engagement on the issues so critical to families in our communities. I believe Ms. Tanden would excel and be director. I hope the Committee, and really the full Senate, will swiftly move to advance her nomination. Today I am very pleased we have the opportunity to speak today with Shalanda Young, who I believe is an excellent choice for this role. Ms. Young will bring a wealth of experience to the job. She has a deep understanding of the Federal budget and the appropriations process, and the know-how of working with agencies and Members of Congress to make progress on a range of critical issues. As our country faces multiple crises, the role of OMB is critical to addressing these challenges head on, from navigating the current public health crisis, to stabilizing our economy, to confronting the climate crisis, to addressing the rampant inequality throughout our society. So, Ms. Young, my question for you today is how do you see this administration prioritizing investments to tackle those crises, and what is the economic case for strong and decisive actions to meet this moment? Ms. Young. Thank you, Senator Murray, and it is good to see you. I have certainly been a fan from the other side of the Appropriations Committee in the House. I think you all will be busy working on the first order of business this week. If we do not take full steps to crush the virus, the economics of it are going to come home tenfold. President Biden has certainly talked about the next step being the need to invest in infrastructure. During the regular appropriations process we do the best we can, especially with budget caps, but the types of investments that are needed to ensure that this country remains an economic leader and competes with the Chinas of the world, we have to invest in our roads, bridges--I am sorry Senator Graham is gone--our dredging projects. Army Corps is woefully in need of additional funding, if we want our shipping lanes to remain open. So I certainly, if confirmed, look forward to working with Congress on those big investments, because if we go too little, if we do not do what is needed now, and I worked on the Great Recession package, and one of the complaints was, in , it was not big enough. So you certainly have my commitment to work with Congress, I think on many pieces that have been bipartisan in the past, to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much. You know, from the beginning of this pandemic I said historic crises like these demand bold solutions. It is so important the Senate continues to move quickly this week to pass COVID relief and get direct relief to all those who are struggling, and to start our country on a path to more equitable future on the other side of this pandemic. Before I close I do want to again raise an issue of critical importance to Washington State, and that is the cleanup of the Hanford nuclear site. I talked about this previously with Ms. Tanden. I look forward to also working in close partnership with you to make sure the Hanford mission is on a cost-effective trajectory without compromising cleanup, and I look forward to talking with you about that once you are confirmed. And finally, Ms. Young, I do want to thank you for your willingness to serve in this position at such a critical time in this country. I look forward to supporting this nomination. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the time this morning. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Senator Murray. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. There are not many people on the professional staff of the Appropriations Committee who are anxious to get away, so I question your judgment, but I am glad for your public service. It happens that I am more interested in OMB from the standpoint of what it does on regulatory review than what I do in regard to the budget part of your work. So I am going to start out there, and I only have one question in that area. The president memo entitled, quote/unquote, ``Modernizing Regulatory Review'' directs OMB to update its guidance to agencies to, quote, ``fully account for regulatory benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify.'' Under the implementation of this memo, how will agencies be instructed to compare quantitative and non-quantitative benefits and costs, and how does that differ from the current cost benefit analysis framework? Ms. Young. Thank you, Senator. I thought you might talk about this. I want to reiterate something you heard from the nominee for the Director job, that the underlying Executive Order has been reaffirmed by President Biden, and that has served both Republican and Democratic administrations, and it says we must do cost benefit analysis of regulations. What the improving and modernizing plan you have outlined, which I certainly hope to have a role as Deputy of looking at the regulatory process, is an effort to ensure that we are reaching communities. I talked about one that I grew up in. Oftentimes it is hard to quantify when you are looking at towns of , , whether the benefit outweighs a small group of people. There might be high costs, but that does not mean we should not be doing something to make those rural lives, the lives of people who might be from minority racial backgrounds, those people living with disabilities, those things may not come out well in a regular cost benefit analysis, but I think we can all agree that we need to ensure that those amongst us who need the most help, we find a way. And I think that memo that you talked about is tasking us with finding a way to make sure we do not leave certain Americans behind. Senator Grassley. Okay. Thank you. Another thing that bothers me over several decades is the fact that the Department of Defense (DOD) is the only department of government that can't get a, what you call kind of a certified statement of fiscal responsibility, a clean audit I guess you would call it. The Department of Defense relies on hundreds of outdated legacy financial management systems. These systems cannot produce reliable data and are one major obstacle to preventing the DOD from obtaining what I said, a clean audit opinion. How would you approach this issue through the authority of the OMB, assuming you have authority, and I am not sure that I am up to date on that, and ensure that these systems are replaced or fixed so that they are able to generate complete and reliable financial data needed to support clean opinions? Ms. Young. As you can imagine, I have certainly looked at this from the appropriations angle, and, by the way, it was a difficult decision leaving someplace I have been and loved for a long time, so thanks for acknowledging that but hopefully I can continue to be in service, if confirmed. I think part of the issue, DOD is not the only one that has legacy systems that do not serve them well when it comes to managing their financial house. Part of the problem is a resource problem. We often, the choice, when it comes to Congress, and, you know, OMB as well, look at the traditional spending of DOD. So do you need a new submarine or do you need an IT system? Well, we probably need both, but it tends to not be the jazziest thing that can be sold in the halls of Congress. So you certainly have my commitment to work with you, and I certainly will work with the Pentagon, because this is, I think the least we owe the American people, to ensure that we can show that these agencies have clean financial audits. Senator Grassley. Okay. I have only got eight seconds left. For decades, tax regulation generally skipped the review process other agencies had to follow in submitting significant regulations to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) at OMB for review. This changed in , when the Treasury Department and OMB entered into an agreement to subject significant tax regulations to OIRA review. Do you expect the Biden administration to maintain that agreement? Ms. Young. Senator, I expect we will use this improving and modernizing memo to review, and that will be one of the things, and I would love to work with your staff on this issue and make sure we are getting your concerns as we are looking at this review process. Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator. Senator Wyden. Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and for holding this important hearing. I just want to touch, for a quick moment, on the matter of Neera Tanden's nomination, because I think colleagues should know that she is very much interested in two bipartisan priorities of a number of members. For example, Senator Grassley and I put together a bill to stop pharmaceutical price gouging, and we basically said if these companies are selling things like insulin and they are jacking up the prices again and again and again, which they have, they basically have to make rebates if they ever raise prices above inflation, bipartisan support. We also support the effort that Chairman Sanders is talking about here today, which is Medicare negotiating the cost of prescription drugs. So these are bipartisan issues. The same has been true in terms of rural America, and I asked Ms. Tanden about a matter that I am pursuing with Senator Crapo and Senator Risch, trying to help the rural communities get off the roller coaster with respect to their payments, and we continue to strengthen the Secure Rural Schools Program. So Ms. Tanden, as members consider her nomination, on prescription drugs and on the question of jobs for rural America, has a bipartisan track record. I would also like to say that I am very much looking forward to supporting Ms. Young for this crucial position as well, and I want to ask her about just a couple of quick questions. I think we all know that millions of Americans are unemployed right now. Unemployment insurance expires March th. And dollar for dollar, there really are not multipliers out there like helping people who are laid off through no fault of their own, because those funds that they get are used for making rent and buying groceries and paying for medicine, and kids' shoes. And there has been a major limitation is that politicians can set an arbitrary end date for the coverage that folks and communities need to stay afloat. I have recently proposed, again, with the support of Chairman Sanders and a number of other colleagues in the Senate, to basically tie this assistance to economic conditions on the ground, and the unemployment and relief checks should basically be part of a stabilizer kind of system so that we do not get into another situation like we had in the last big recession, where we simply had gone too small. We ought to put these programs on approach tied to economic conditions on the ground what is called an automatic stabilizer, and I am very pleased to be working on this with Chairman Sanders and a number of colleagues. Ms. Young, we have been impressed by the fact that President Biden is very interested in this idea. Should you be confirmed for this position, tell us a little bit about your thoughts, and we would very much like to have a ringing endorsement today as well. Ms. Young. Senator Wyden, thank you for the question. So even though I have been on the Appropriations Committee, we have had the privilege of putting these packages together so I am absolutely familiar with the stabilizer idea. I know a lot of Senators and House members have tried to bring this to fruition. I am certainly supportive. I think we are about to hit another cliff on March th, you know, which is unfortunate, and I think last time we did not make the time frame, so we have people who have to deal with these gaps in assistance, which should be avoided. I also understand, from the congressional standpoint, some of the hurdles to tackling the stabilizer issue has been Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scoring. It is tough. The way scoring does has just made it an expensive proposition. But I think it is important enough, we have to keep working to find a way to make sure millions of Americans do not face these artificial cliffs in their unemployment benefits. Senator Wyden. Well, thank you, Ms. Young. I have got one other question, but, you know, what you are really touching on is the heart of what we want to do. We want to empower communities and we want to empower folks who have been laid off, through no fault of their own, to be in a position to get on with their lives. Let's empower them rather than politicians, who are the ones who, in effect, if they can set an arbitrary date, they are the ones who use those dates for leverage. We ought to be empowering people. Let me ask you about one last issue, very quickly, that is important to tribes in my State. OMB currently faces a decision on the poorly made recommendations of the Public Buildings Reform Board to close National Archives and Records in Seattle, Washington. This decision affect Oregonians, including our Klamath Tribes who rely on their access to important historical records. We sent a bipartisan letter to OMB detailing our concerns about how Native Americans and Alaskan Natives in the Northwest were not consulted. Do you commit to working with all of us to increase transparency of the process, get more input, and particularly consult with the tribes before any final recommendations are instituted? Ms. Young. Absolutely, Senator. I have been involved in many decisions and fighting those from the congressional side when offices close. I understand the intense need these regional and local offices are to ensure that people can petition and get services from their governments. So you certainly have my commitment to work with you. Senator Wyden. My time is up. I have heard nothing but positive things about you, Ms. Young, and your work, and I look forward to supporting your nomination. Ms. Young. Thank you, sir. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Wyden. Senator Toomey. Senator Toomey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Young, welcome to the Committee, and I know that this is not your decision but I do have to express just how deeply disappointed I am that President Biden and our Democratic colleagues have decided to undertake a purely partisan process to pass a bill with so much content that has absolutely nothing to do with COVID or an economic recovery, and that, despite the fact that last year Congress passed five-five--overwhelmingly bipartisan bills in response to the pandemic and the economic disaster that we faced. Those bills added up to almost $ trillion. Each one of them got over votes. The last bill, which was the second-largest economic relief bill in American history, was signed just about eight weeks ago. Hundreds of billions of dollars are still unspent. The economy is in a strong recovery mode. And absolutely there are pockets that are doing very badly, but on balance and in the aggregate, the economy is doing very, very well. And despite all that, rather than working with Republicans on identifying the areas that have been left behind, despite all of this massive, massive spending, the approach is just ignore Republicans, do a partisan approach, and spend almost $ trillion, the vast majority of which has nothing to do with COVID or the economic circumstances we are in. Even liberal Democratic economic advisors are warning--Larry Summers has famously said about this bill, that it brings on some big risks. The result could be inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation. So I really am very, very disappointed that this is the path that we are on. I want to just be clear about some of the specifics, as I understand them, from the House-passed bill that has arrived at the Senate. Can you confirm that a family of four with an income of $ , last year, that had no income decline, no income interruption whatsoever as a result of the pandemic and the lockdowns, that already received $ , , in addition to all the ordinary six-figure income, and under this bill they will get another $ , from taxpayers. Is that accurate? Ms. Young. Senator Toomey, I do believe the House bill is very similar to the bipartisan ones you mentioned earlier, so yes. Senator Toomey. Yeah, so this is breathtaking for most Americans, that affluent families, with no interruption whatsoever in their income, having already gotten $ , from taxpayers, now they are going to get yet another $ , . It is as if money grows on trees, and the Federal Government should be in the business of sending affluent people checks, maybe periodically, maybe regularly. There is just no rational basis for this. Let me ask you this. In , we now know that according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis--that is part of the Commerce Department--the aggregate revenue collected by State and local governments hit an all-time record high. There are a lot of reasons for it but that is the fact, all-time record high in . And that is separate and apart, that is revenue that they collected. That is separate from the $ billion that went to State and local governments over the course of last year, under a variety of bills. Now we are told that the House bill and the Biden proposal is to send yet another $ billion. Isn't it actually quite likely that a number of States are simply, with all of this cash being thrown at them, they are going to cut taxes at the State level. Don't you think that is a reasonably likely outcome? Ms. Young. Senator, you talked about President Biden's bipartisanship. He continues to outreach to governors on both sides of the aisle who continue to say that they are in need. It is not just a revenue loss fund but also one in which we expect those States and locals to continue to provide necessary services as people depend on their local units of government. Senator Toomey. I understand, but if you are collecting an all-time record level of revenue, probably you can provide the services that ordinarily provide, and if in addition to an all- time record amount of revenue you got half a trillion dollars from the Federal Government, it seems like there is lots of money to go around. Last question. I wonder, do you think there is any downside whatsoever, any reason at all, any concerns, about systematically paying people more not to work than they make working, designing an unemployment system whereby a very substantial percentage of workers will get paid more to sit at home than they get paid to go to their work? Is this how we should demonstrate our commitment to the dignity of work? Ms. Young. That was a phrase I was going to use. Certainly people I know from all walks of life have dignity of work. They are not accepting government assistance, in my opinion, and in some of the data we have seen they are using this enhanced unemployment to make ends meet. Senator Toomey. I see my time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Toomey. Senator Stabenow. Senator Stabenow. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. First, Ms. Young, congratulations on your nomination. I have heard nothing but extremely positive things, both from Democrats and Republicans, and I look forward to working with you if you are confirmed, which hopefully will happen. I also strongly support Neera Tanden, and I think the two of you would be really an excellent pair, and I am hopeful that we will have both of you. I do want to say to my friend who just spoke that when we talk about bipartisanship, certainly in the last year in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act we had a bipartisan deal. We moved on some things, but then we got to, I think it was May, and the Senate Republican leader said he thought no more needed to be done at that point, you know, that things were okay, we did not need to act. It took from May until December to pass additional support for American families and to address the pandemic and issues around trying to get children back to school safely. We do not have that much time now. We just do not have time to wait another six, eight months. What we have is bipartisan support in the country, and we have got to get as many shots in people's arms in possible. We have got to help people in small businesses, small family farms get through and survive this pandemic, and we have got to make sure every child can get back into school safely, period. And so I am glad we are moving, and we certainly would welcome bipartisan support from our colleagues in the Senate. Now on question, let me just say that when I talk--there are so many things on your plate that I want to talk specifics on things that I am involved with. As the Chairwoman of Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, right now when we look at the climate crisis we have a great potential to harness our farms and forests as leaders in tackling the climate crisis. And I am working on several bipartisan bills, along with my great friend, Senator Braun, and other colleagues, and I look forward to working with the administration to enact them, which will give Secretary Vilsack and others at U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) new tools to address this urgent issue, in a voluntary, bipartisan, producer-led way, which is our focus. So if confirmed, will you commit to working with us to prioritize climate-smart agriculture and forestry investments in the President's upcoming budgets and through other actions at the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere? Ms. Young. You have my absolute commitment to work with you on those very important issues. Senator Stabenow. Great. Let me talk about something else that is certainly at the forefront in the pandemic, and that is the mental health of millions and millions and millions of Americans. We have traditionally, historically underfunded behavioral health systems in this country. The good news is that we are making progress. My friend, Senator Roy Blunt, and I have been leading efforts strongly supported on both sides of the aisle, to improve quality care through the creation of new certified community behavioral health clinics. These clinics, among other things, require high-quality standards, -hour, -day-a-week crisis services, outpatient mental health care, substance abuse care, and working with emergency rooms, law enforcement, and veterans' groups, which is very important. So when we look at this we are actually saving money as well as doing something very effective. The last Health and Human Services (HHS) budget found that these services led to a percent decrease in emergency department visits for behavioral health, percent reduction in time spent in jail, which is why this is so strongly supported by sheriffs and police chiefs and so on, and a percent decrease in homelessness. The challenge for us is quantifying that in terms of the budget. First of all, we should be covering these service in health care above the neck as well as below the neck, and could you talk about the role of OMB in quantifying some of the downstream savings from increased access to behavioral health care, and can we count on you to focus on those issues in upcoming budgets? Ms. Young. You absolutely can, and I am very proud of the behavioral and mental health funding in the current COVID package. It is much needed. It is an area, again, where I think the regular appropriations process--would have loved to have done more, but we have certainly been living under budget caps for the last ten years. So COVID has exacerbated these problems. It is appropriate that it be in this package, and I am glad to see that it is. Senator, you certainly have my commitment to helping quantify the benefits of this funding and working to ensure we have adequate funding and do better by those line items. Senator Stabenow. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I think probably my time is up. I will just follow up with Ms. Young about another passionate, important topic, which is making sure that we are supporting all efforts to protect our Great Lakes. So thank you very much. I look forward to supporting your confirmation. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Senator Stabenow. Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Young, how are you? Ms. Young. Good, sir. How are you? Senator Kennedy. I am okay. I want to ask you about the proclivity of the Federal Government to persist in paying dead people. You probably read about it, but last--let me see here-- last spring, when we sent out our first batch of coronavirus relief checks, we paid out $ . billion to deceased Americans. And we do not get this money back, and, of course, in some instances, in many instances the checks are cashed, which obviously is indicative of fraud. We have passed legislation, and let me back up. We are not sure how much we pay out in checks to dead people every year, but it is a lot. It is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars, and there is a lot of fraud involved. The Congress passed legislation to try to fix this problem. I will not bore you with the details, but because of the politics we had to put in a provision that the legislation would not really take effect for years. So we basically had to agree, because of the politics, that we would continue to pay dead people for more years. Can you do something about that when you are running OMB? Ms. Young. Senator Kennedy, I think you have pursued this. I know it is very important. You pursued it in the Financial Services construction of Appropriations Committee so I am very familiar with your work here and your consistent drumbeat. I think part of this is the government systems. We talked about this earlier, with a different Senator, is we have to do better with our IT systems. That is definitely part of the problem, and I will certainly commit to working, just like I did previously, in improving these systems so that we--no one wants fraud, waste, and abuse in important government programs. It does a disservice to those who really need government services. It puts a target on their back. So I think there is a bipartisan commitment to make sure we do what we can to weed out---- Senator Kennedy. Can I interrupt you, Ms. Young---- Ms. Young. Yes, sir. Senator Kennedy. --because, look, I have watched you and I have followed your career, and you are a very smart person and I think you can fix this. And, to me it is very simple. We, meaning the Federal Government, get data every year, every month, every day from the States about who died. It is not perfect data but we get it, and it goes into a database at the Federal Government. But the group in charge of maintaining that database does not really share it with other agencies. It is complicated. It is needlessly complicated. And I think that you are a very smart person. I think that if you said, look, you call the White House, speak to the President, and say, ``Mr. President, this is low-hanging fruit. We really need to stop paying dead people. It is embarrassing. And Congress has acted on it but because of the politics it had to delay the implementation of the bill for years. Can't we, Mr. President, issue some sort of Executive order and stop paying dead people? I mean, don't we owe that, at least to the taxpayers?'' And I know it is complicated, you know, but it is needlessly complicated. It is very simple. We have the data. It may not be perfect, but it is better than nothing, but we continue to send out the checks. And I think you are going to be running OMB. I think you could stop it. Ms. Young. Well, Senator Kennedy---- Senator Kennedy. I have full confidence in you. Ms. Young. Thank you for the full confidence. I appreciate that. If I am confirmed as Deputy you certainly have my commitment to work with you on this. You have raised some good points. Senator Kennedy. You may be more than Deputy. You may be the sheriff. I do not expect you to comment on that. Ms. Young. Thank you, sir. Senator Kennedy. Help me do something about this. I know you can do it. Ms. Young. I look forward to working with you. I do commit to work with you and your staff on this issue. As you said, the American people deserve a Federal Government who gets its data right, and I think it is a bipartisan effort to weed out any whiff of fraud, waste, and abuse. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Ms. Young. Thank you so much. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Whitehouse. Ms. Young, how are you? Welcome. I have two things that I want to show to you. The first is this book, which is a compilation of a whole variety of reports that relate to, as the title says, The Economic Risks of Climate Change. We all know that it is going to change our physical world. We all know that it is going to raise sea levels. We all know it is going to change temperatures, move fisheries around, change weather, create all of these physical, biological, natural consequences. But we have not focused as much as I think we should have on the economic consequences. For instance, when sea levels rise and people who have predictive capability are able to see where the sea levels are going to rise to, they are going to go to mortgage companies, and they are going to go to insurance companies, and they are going to say, ``Hey, I have got some information that you ought to have before you insure that house, or before you issue a mortgage on that house.'' So, nonetheless than Freddie Mac, the big mortgage behemoth, has warned that we are going to have a coastal property values crash when those sea level rise warnings hit the mortgage and insurance markets that support coastal property, and that it is going to be worse than the mortgage meltdown. So that is a pretty serious warning. That is just one. We have got a Nobel Prize winner, testifying under oath, about the catastrophic economic consequences we are looking at. We have got major banks. We have got the Fed. We have got foreign sovereign banks. We have got major, pretty rough corporation organizations who are not exactly eleemosynary. And they are warning, in their own interests, that this is a big deal. So I would ask you to please flip through this--we will give you a copy--because I think it is going to be really important for this administration, which has done a great job on tackling the climate change problem, at least in its early initial steps--to make sure that these warnings are made loud and clear. It is probably the most warned of hazard that we have ever seen, but because the fossil fuel industry has got so much of our Congress locked up in its grip we have not responded to those warnings. So that is one. If you could take that and also take this issue seriously. I will be hounding you about it, obviously. Ms. Young. I am from the State of Louisiana, and---- Senator Whitehouse. So you know it. Ms. Young. Yes. Senator Whitehouse. Yes. You are losing more of your coastline than I think any other state in the country right now, and Rhode Island, my State, is looking to having to redraw its map. Senator Kaine here is looking at losing Norfolk Naval Station, because you can build the piers up higher and higher at Norfolk Naval Station but you cannot build up the schools and the markets and the roads and the entire community that supports that naval station there. So the former head of his naval station has warned that in years that thing is gone. We are going to have to re-site that naval station. So this is all serious, and because of fossil fuel mischief a lot of Members of Congress will not take it seriously, and we have got to make sure people understand. So thank you. The second thing is a health care thing. I use this graph a lot. CBO, back around the time that we did the Affordable Care Act (ACA), did a prediction of American health care costs were going to rise, which is this top line. I turns out, after the Affordable Care Act got passed, health care costs did not go up so fast, and we actually got the lower line as our experience. So if you take the current projection from our lower experience and compare it to what that projection is tagged onto the previous experience, you get this green differential, which, in the next years, is $ trillion savings on Federal health care. In , we are going to hit the Medicare trust fund. We do not have much time. We have got to fix this. Nobody is going to cut benefits. But whatever is happening here that saves $ trillion, we need to do a lot more of. And I submit to you that it is quality improvements and incentives in the health care system, it is getting away from fee-for-service treadmill in the health care system, and it is really pushing the accountable care organizations, the provider Accountable Care Organizations (ACO), that are doing such a good job. I have got two of the best ones in Rhode Island. World class. They are not the best in Rhode Island. They are the best in the world. They are the best in the country. They happen to be in Rhode Island. And they are driving costs down, their patients are getting better outcomes, everybody is happier with the better service. It is win, win, win. But we have got to understand that for the big deal that it is, and connect those little ACOs to this big $ trillion, and fix the mess that our health care system is right now, and I hope that we will work together on that also. Ms. Young. Absolutely, sir, and the bill you are considering this week does have some improvements, some increased subsidies for ACA. Hopefully can get more people in it, and I think there is a lot more to do on the ACA front to ensure that that graph continues to get bigger. Senator Whitehouse. Yeah. We can spread that actually further with more work that is good stuff. Thanks, Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Senator Warner. Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Ms. Young, it is good to see you, at least virtually. I think you have been very impressive in your answers. I do want to say, though, that I know some of my colleagues on the Republican side have made the decision about Neera Tanden. I hope some will still reconsider. I look forward to supporting you, Ms. Young, but hope is still that, at least initially, I will be supporting you for Deputy Director. I want to get to three quick questions. One, Virginia is home to about , Federal workers. They have been under enormous assault under the Trump administration as the previous administration tried to politicize the workforce. I saw it particularly in my role in the Intel Committee what has happened to our intel workforce. And while I was heartened by the Biden administration's initial actions to repeal the Schedule F Executive order that Trump tried to put in in the waning days of his administration, from bargaining rights to pay to just general morale, the Federal workforce has been hurting. Layered on top of that, obviously, all the additional constraints with COVID. Can you speak on how you could coordinate with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to deal with this overriding issue of moral in the Federal workforce? Ms. Young. Senator, I pause because I started my career as a civil servant at National Institutes of Health (NIH). I understand how much more this country has benefitted by having a motivated Federal workforce, who shows up every day, does over and beyond. They could be in private industry, a lot of them, making more than they do in their government service. So it is not about a job for the Federal workers that I have known and worked with. It is about service. So that is one of the things I hope, if confirmed as Deputy Director, certainly within OMB, is to empower and bring a lot of that back to the career staff. I know that is a goal of mine, I hope to leave, during my time of service, is to let them know that we appreciate their service, we trust that they are good stewards of Federal policy, and you certainly have my commitment--some will need congressional fixes, congressional pardoners--to work with you to make sure that our Federal workers are getting the benefits necessary. Often in these budget deals that come up one of the main losers are Federal workers. We tend to cut their retirement. We tend to do things that do not, I think, do a lot for morale. So you certainly have my commitment to work with you to bring back, I think, some of the things that have eroded over the last few years. Senator Warner. Well, I would look forward to working with you on that. I had that issue over my years here, something started by Ted Kaufman when he served as a Senator from Delaware, going down on the floor of the Senate, calling out the great contribution of Federal workers on an individualized basis. Your work at NIH, you know, as you said, a lot of these workers could be making a lot more. This was a piece of public service and it is going to be great working with a partner who supports that service. Kind of related to that, one of the areas that the Chairman has been a big advocate, and I have generally been supportive of during the period of COVID, trying to help workers with increased unemployment benefits and trying to make sure we cover a whole group of folks, for example, gig workers and others I think is a very positive action. One of the things that we have had some debate on is whether the economy includes some of that additional benefits cut back. And we have had, I think, a good debate on this issue, but the challenge has been, to be able to do that, we have got to upgrade our IT systems within the Federal Government. Now, literally, we could not even put in place economic stabilizers in a rational way because our IT system is so bad. We have dramatically underinvested, not just under Trump but candidly even under President Obama. There is something called the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF). I hope you will [inaudible] legislation that I have got. I know President Biden put forward a $ billion investment and unfortunately it got cut back in the House to $ billion. In your last two seconds, can you talk to upgrading our technology? Ms. Young. Yes. You heard it through several Senators' questions that, you know, it is central to many issues we have with payments to individuals, with ensuring our financial audits, a lot of it comes back down to technology, and you certainly have my commitment to work with you. I am very familiar with the TMF, making sure we get investments there. Senator Warner. Thank you, Ms. Young. I look forward to supporting you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Warner. Senator Merkley. Senator Merkley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Ms. Young, I just want to jump right into questions since we do not have a lot of time. We had the situation in previous administrations where OIRA, part of OMB, has proceeded to be a place where rules go and disappear, and never to be seen again, or to sit untended for years. Things like mercury air toxics rule, rearview cameras in cars, the issue of a rule related to coal ash. We have the vaping rule, which we had all these illegal products on the market and nothing happened, and millions of American youth became addicted to vaping, a situation very hard to reverse which will affect health care costs and the quality of life for millions of Americans for generations to come. And so how do you feel about this section of OIRA becoming just this place where regulations go to suffer and die with no transparency about what is happening? Ms. Young. Senator, it is certainly not the statutory goal of OIRA and something we should not strive to have that opinion of OIRA. I do believe we can use the presidential memo calling for OMB to lead an effort to improve and modernize, to do something about that perception, and work with our partners in Congress to make sure that we fix this issue. Senator Merkley. Thank you, and I look forward to talking with you when we end up with challenges of disappearing regulations in OIRA in the future. I want to turn then to the cost benefit analysis that you referred to before, and the decision to keep it in place. Often that cost benefit analysis does not capture externalities, and certainly not the social cost of carbon. Can you speak to how OMB's cost benefit analysis can reflect the true cost of decarbonization or the true advantages of decarbonization? Ms. Young. Senator, I think you are speaking to the very core of the presidential memo that we have talked a lot about, on improving and modernizing. I think it is good to keep a basic set of facts, a cost benefit, but you are absolutely right. You see it in carbon, and actually not just carbon, in greenhouse gases, you see it in regulations that have to do with servicing people who might be from rural America or living with disabilities, that often looking just at costs and benefits is not enough to understand the full impact. If our goal is to improve the lives of all Americans, I think we have to, even if it is difficult, find a way to quantify these things, because as you mentioned and as Senator Whitehouse has mentioned, climate change is an economics issue as much as anything. Senator Merkley. Does that mean that the OMB cost benefit analysis will now incorporate the social cost of carbon? Ms. Young. I think, Senator, you have seen administrative action. I am not there yet, but if confirmed I am happy to get back to you on the details. I cannot speak about every single action that has occurred, since I am not there, but my understanding on the social cost of greenhouse gases, with carbon being one part of that, there are working groups that have reformed, that have been done away with in order to help quantify that cost. Senator Merkley. Thank you, Ms. Young. President Biden, in a related issue, has committed to directing percent of green Federal investments towards environmental justice communities, necessitating a sort of equity screen and recognizing that low- income communities are often hit particularly hard by environmental effects. But that has to be tracked. Do you see OMB as having a role in tracking and targeting those investments to address that percent goal? Ms. Young. OMB will be a part of that process, as stated in the President's Executive order on climate change. There is a specific section dealing exclusively with environmental justice and it lays out the members of the council that will deal with those issues, and OMB will be a part of that. Senator Merkley. Thank you. And finally, how do you envision OMB working to drive solutions to the student debt crisis in our country? Ms. Young. I have to imagine OMB will be central to offering ideas and legislative solutions. I do know that it will take a partner in Congress to ensure we deal with that issue. You do not normally like breakups, but one of my breakups has been with Navient, myself, years ago. It is crushing, the student loan debt, and I am one of the lucky ones. Senator Merkley. I am sorry. I missed that. Your own personal loan? Ms. Young. My own personal loans. It was one of the best breakups I have ever had, was to pay the last payment to Navient, and again, that was years after I started college, and I am one of the lucky ones. Senator Merkley. Well, congratulations. I hope you had a big party at that moment, and I do hope that OMB will work in partnership with the administration on the cancellation of loan debt. I support the broader goal of $ , . It would be incredible stimulus and an opportunity for so many to escape this deep burden that other developing countries do not impose on their aspiring students. But even at the lower level of $ , , it is one thing to have it as a vision and it is another to actually make it happen, and I hope OMB can help with that. Ms. Young. Thank you. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Senator Merkley. Senator Braun. Senator Braun. Thank you, Chairman Sanders. Good to be here discussing something, Ms. Young, that to me--I have been here a couple of years, and I know you have been in the House part of Appropriations. I have run an enterprise that has had to really be worried about what lies down the road. In other words, how do you get things to work out financially? I see a trajectory that we are on that just, to me, looks unsustainable, and whether you believe in the modern monetary theory. With what you crafted, being involved in appropriations, where we are at currently, where we have got structural, trillion-dollar deficits. We have got a balance sheet that, I do not care how good you are as a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), would be something you could not be proud of. Here, it is different. You know, we are lucky that we are in a place where we can borrow for nearly zero. That changes as soon as we are not the reserve currency. You have got an impending crisis with the Medicare trust fund being completely depleted here in a little over years. We have been paying into it, employers and employees, since the ' s. It is social security that is even more ominous in terms of what would happen if you let it continue on the trajectory. Tell me a little bit about how you think, for anyone here, especially that looks to the Federal Government as a place that you want to do more with, how do you keep it in a healthy place going from here forward, and what do you think your input has been towards being an appropriator, that, to me, looks like no one really cares about how this is going to work out for future generations. Ms. Young. Senator Braun, you know, I perfectly acknowledge long-term debt has to be addressed. It is probably only going to be addressed with bipartisan solutions. But I do have to turn to, you know, people smarter than me, and I would certainly listen to Secretary Yellen, who tells us we will be on a worse economic trajectory if we do not do something--not just do something--if we do not ensure the health of American citizens and then turn our full sights to ensuring investments for our economic recovery. At some point we are going to have to turn to long-term, but I do not think we have ever faced anything like this pandemic before. So I certainly agree with you, but I do think there is still room, as you mentioned. It is very cheap to borrow right now, which is something I think we also have to look at when we are looking at the response to the pandemic. Senator Braun. So normally when you borrow money you do it for something that is a tangible asset, an investment, only borrow to invest, never borrow to spend or consume. Of course, we consume everything here. I think that is another thing to think about. Let me ask you, on the revenue side of the ledger. Everybody is really good at spending here. I have had conversations with folks on the Budget Committee. Can you raise revenue? Do you think it is realistic that you can bridge the structural deficit gap with that, and how would you consider doing that? And can you do that in a meaningful way before you start to throttle back economic growth, and also, looking at maybe what was in place pre-COVID to whereas somebody off the street, I thought we had it pretty well hitting the mark. We helped small businesses through the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, C- corps got probably way too big a break that they did not need. What do you think about the revenue side, that no one wants to talk about? Ms. Young. Senator Braun, I mean, I am sure you already know this. President Biden has looked to increasing the tax rate for those over $ , , and for some corporations who, I think, some of the lessons from the tax break did not do as much investing in their personnel as was hoped or touted before that act. So I do think there is some room, on the revenue side, to help out long-term debt. I do think there are some other things besides revenue and spending. Senator Whitehouse talked about the cost of health care. We have got to do something so the government is not paying nearly as much for health care and neither are private citizens. So I think there will have to be a multi-pronged view of how we do this, but, you know, we cannot cut benefits for people that have paid into them. I have my parents here. You know, they are called entitlements for a reason. People have paid their entire careers in their lives for these benefits, and part of that is ensuring that health care does not cost what it costs to provide it to the American people. Senator Braun. Well, thank you, and I think that is a bit of realism, and it is going to take some really hard decisions that, in my observation, do not happen often here, along the lines of having some political will to make those tough decisions if we are going to have it sustainable in the long run. Ms. Young. Thank you, sir. Senator Braun. Thank you. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Braun. Senator Kaine. Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks, Ms. Young. Congratulations to you. I intend to support you, and you have had a distinguished public service career. Two editorial comments and two questions. One editorial comment, I am not sure you should need Senate confirmation. I think if President Biden wants to hire you to be Deputy Director I think he should be able to hire you. I am in my ninth year in the Senate, third President, and an observation about the Senate is I think we have too many Senate-confirmable positions, and each one chews up some Committee time and then chews up some floor time. And by chewing up finite time then legislative time gets shrunk. So I might start urging that on my colleagues. I would love to have you here to ask you tons of questions, but I do not necessarily think that Deputy Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy Directors of agencies should need Senate confirmation. That is editorial comment number one. Number two, Neera Tanden. The controversy about Neera is largely over her social media comments, which could be levied at virtually all of us. I mean, it is partly a challenge for the individual, and she has got to own that, and she has apologized for it, and it is partly the world we live in, where we say things in the heat of the moment and social media gives us the ability to do it. My editorial comment is this. We faced so many nominees in the past administration who had really intemperate things to say in social media accounts, including about me, but they apologized. And when they apologized their apologies were accepted by virtually all Republicans and a lot of Democrats. So Neera Tanden has apologized, and I just worry that there is a double standard with her that why would we accept the apologies of others, about comments on social media, that, if anything, were more extreme, and not accept Neera Tanden's apologies? And I am nervous about that, and I ask that question not just to Republicans. I ask it to Democrats. Two questions. Ms. Young. And, Senator Kaine, I know you were speaking, but I have not had the chance to weigh in on this question. I certainly think before this Committee you saw Neera Tanden apologize profusely about the tweets. I think what you also saw is an expansive knowledge of various policy areas. And certainly I have gotten to know Neera over the last few weeks. We did not have much interactions before then, and I do think we both bring some skill sets in different areas where we make a great team, if both of us were confirmed. So thank you for those comments and I hope if you listen to her time before this Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), she really did lay out her vast policy experience. Senator Kaine. I completely agree with you. Now, on to the two questions. One of the things about your nomination that makes me the happiest is that you have years' experience working in the Article I branch. The OMB, in the previous administration, treated us like we were an annoyance on a good day, or an enemy on a bad day, and there were more bad days than good days. And they particularly treated those in the minority party, the Democrats in that administration, as the enemy. I am not sure they were that good to the majority party either. So, for example, with issues like congressional requests for information, you will take an oath, should you be confirmed, to the Constitution of the United States, not to the President. Can I have your assurance--and you have already been asked this by Senator Sanders, but I want to have your assurance on this. Will you treat, as somebody who has sat on the congressional side of this dais, will you treat requests from Senators on this Committee, be they Democratic or Republican, with respect, and try to be as responsive as you can, as promptly as you can? Ms. Young. I cannot answer that more emphatically. Yes, and you are absolutely right. I have heard from Republican members as well who not only could not get information but would see their things important to them go to OMB to never be seen again. Senator Kaine. And if you have a problem, or anybody at OMB, with committee members just like pestering you so you cannot do your work, you can take that to the Chairman and the Chairman can be an enforcer and tell us to knock it off. But reasonable requests should be dealt with in a prompt fashion, whether they are made by Republicans or Democrats. I am glad to hear you agree with that, and I knew you would. Second question. So I came into the Senate in January of . Sequestration and budget caps went into effect in late February. We had a -week government shutdown in October. We have had endless CRs. We had a month-long shutdown of a portion of the U.S. Government in late ' and . I have an opinion about how I would grade the Federal budget process since I have been here. If I was asking you to grade the Federal budget process, what grade would you give it? Ms. Young. Wow, that is a tough one, on the process. Senator Kaine. Well, not the process, not the process as in the statute, but grade our performance. Ms. Young. Okay. Get away from the process---- Senator Kaine. Rate our performance. Ms. Young. --which is often ugly. When we finish I will give it an A, because we got there, and I think there is a lot of value in that. Senator Kaine. I am just going to say, I would not give it an A, and I would love an acknowledgment that there should be some significant improvement. That is not going to affect my vote. Ms. Young. There has to be improvement, Senator. I still find a lot of intrinsic value in working through an annual process, and you and I talked about this, as someone who loves this institution. And I have told you this personally, my concern would be if anything would keep Congress from doing that bare-knuckle negotiations, where you got to hold the Executive branch accountable each year. So yes, it needs improvement, but I would hate to see anything that required less congressional action because of that. Senator Kaine. Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Kaine. Senator Van Hollen. Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, and I was pleased with Neera Tanden's nomination to be Director of OMB, and I am very pleased with yours to be the Deputy Director. Congratulations. And I want to pick up a little bit on the process, but especially the part of the process that has been broken, at least over the last years. And as the staff director of the House Appropriations Committee you were deeply involved in addressing the illegal withholding of funds by OMB during the last administration, the most prominent case involved withholding security assistance for Ukraine. And I asked at the time that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the nonpartisan GAO, review that matter and determine whether a withholding violated the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), which, as you know, is the law that is supposed to prevent the Executive branch, regardless of party, for unilaterally refusing to spend funds that are provided in laws passed by the Congress. GAO looked at it and confirmed that the Trump administration violated that law. As a member of this Committee, the Budget Committee, we were able to put together bipartisan legislation that included a provision I proposed to strengthen the Impoundment Control Act and increase transparency for the apportionment process at OMB. We have not yet passed that legislation. I would like to get your commitment to work with us to strengthen the laws that protect constitutional separation of powers and Congress' power of the purse. Having come from the Appropriations Committee I hope you will work us to do that. Ms. Young. Again, something near and dear to me, and you absolutely have my commitment to working on those. I know there are lots of efforts to strengthen the ICA, and I think also in my commitment to you I will also, you know, commit to working with GAO, who are the arbiters in these things, and they found wrongdoing, and I think we should listen to them when they make those, I think, very thoughtful judgments. Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that. Look, there is a process, and GAO has pointed out some things we can do to further strengthen that process. Obviously, the Executive branch has a role in budget consideration, but as you know, once Congress has spoken it is imperative that the administration, any administration, follow the law with respect to those decisions. I would like to just briefly ask you about the issue of long-term unemployment, because we are all hopeful that as we beat this pandemic and with the passage, I hope, of the emergency bill, that we expect to pass before the middle of this month, that the economy will begin to improve. And we hope to see steady improvement, more people going back to work. But I am very worried about individuals who are long-term unemployed. We have over million long-term unemployed Americans right now. These are individuals who have been out of work for more than months, looking for work. On top of that we have over million Americans who have essentially dropped out of the workforce, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Powell, in response to a question I asked him the other day, indicated that we are going to have to be very intentional about policies to help the long-term unemployed. Even before the pandemic, when the economy was working better, we had over million Americans who were long-term unemployed. I do not expect you to commit to any details, but just would you agree that the issue of long-term unemployment is one that we have to address with intentionality, meaning we cannot just expect that as the economy improves that the long-term unemployed will automatically find work, because we know that has not been true in the past. Ms. Young. Senator Van Hollen, thank you for bringing this up. I think one of the goals of government is to ensure that those who are easily left behind, that we ensure that they are not. So I look forward to working with you on this. Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate it. These are individuals who want to work, they are out there looking for jobs, and really through no fault of their own unable to find it. And it hurts them, and, of course, it hurts the larger community when we are not able to take advantage of their skills in growing the economy. So thank you, and, Mr. Chairman, thank you. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much, Senator Van Hollen. Senator Padilla. Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Young, for your willingness to serve. I know in a prior hear for the Director of OMB position I was able to ask questions generally in regards to concern about equity and the role OMB can play in policymaking and budgeting to address equity challenges in America. We also touched on the economic contributions of immigrants over the course of our nation's history. I know earlier in this hearing we have heard a lot of questions about a number of issues, from climate to COVID response and everything in between. I say all that because I want to raise a couple of issues that are unique, important not just to California, my home State, but the nation as a whole, so let me jump into it. The first of the two is housing and homelessness. The COVID- pandemic has exacerbated our nation's ongoing affordable housing and homelessness crises. Nearly in renters across the country, including an estimated million Californians alone, have been unable to catch up on their rent. Even before the pandemic, a lack of affordable housing and rising rents pushed too many into our societal safety net and even into homelessness, with now more than , individuals experiencing homelessness in California, which could get worse, with evictions related to our recent economic downturn. So as we look to build back better, will you commit to ensuring that the President's budget requests seek significant increases for critical housing programs such as Committee Development Block Grant Program, the Home Investment Partnership Program, homelessness assistance grants, and expanded Section vouchers? And I welcome any other recommendations or suggestions you have in this regard. Ms. Young. Senator, I certainly do commit--I am not there yet so I have not been involved in the budget development. But those are programs I have supported during my time as staff director of the Appropriations Committee, so I certainly will look to work with you to make sure that there is adequate funding in not just the annual programs but I do believe there is still work to be done as we recover from COVID, and possible other legislation. Senator Padilla. Thank you for that. I look forward to following up with you in the weeks, months, and years ahead. The second area--again, I think to issues that have been raised already--is relative to scientific research fundings. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the only agency that funds basic nonbiomedical research, as you know. The potentially groundbreaking projects that the NSF supports drive economic growth and spur transformative discoveries that are critical to our lives. Over the past several decades, these breakthroughs have included accelerated supercomputing, bar codes, improving tumor detection, and even the shaping of the internet as we know it today. Today the NSF is funding projects to better understand the inner working of living cells, forecast and predict earthquakes and tsunamis, advance clean energy technologies, and more. Now while Congress has approved funding increase to NSF's medical counterpart, the National Institutes of Health, NSF funding has not kept pace. So as we act to reverse the denigration of science and scientists that we have seen over the last years, it is critical, in my opinion, that we also support scientists and scientific research with the additional funding that they need. So as you work to develop the President's budget request for fiscal year , will you consider prioritizing new investments in scientific research, including increased funding for the National Science Foundation? And part two of the question is, will you also work to uphold the integrity of science as well as support scientist at Federal agencies and research institutions throughout the nation? Ms. Young. I started my career at NIH. I am certainly aware the attention NIH gets from bipartisan members, but its sisters in science, NSF, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), all deserve the same level of support. NSF does great work, supports great work among universities. So you certainly have my commitment to ensuring that I would lead my voice to those who want to prioritize NSF. And we certainly have seen a need for that increased basic research during COVID, not just at NIH but NSF as well. Senator Padilla. As one of the few engineers and scientists serving in this body I thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Padilla. I want to thank Ms. Young for appearing before the Committee today. Ms. Young, your full statement will be included in the record. As information for all Senators, questions for the record are due by noon tomorrow, with signed hard copies delivered to the Committee clerk in Dirksen . Emailed copies will also be accepted, due to our current conditions, under our rules. Ms. Young will have days from receipt of our questions to respond with answers. With no further business---- Senator Whitehouse. Mr. Chairman, may I make one last comment before we close out? Chairman Sanders. Very briefly. Senator Whitehouse. Very briefly. I just had an exchange with Director Wray about the FBI's consistent refusal to answer questions from Congress through the Trump administration. In nine different committee hearings, seven got zero Questions for the Record (QFR) answered. Zero. And what he blamed it on was the interagency process that all have to go through, which OMB runs. So we need to clean that mess up. I think that is a phony, basically, but we need to clean that mess up. Ms. Young. On the Appropriations Committee we can barely produce hearing volumes for lack of QFRs, so you certainly have my commitment that we need to do better. Chairman Sanders. Okay. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Under our rules, Ms. Young will have days from receipt of our questions to respond with answers. With no further business before the Committee, this hearing is adjourned. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the Committee was adjourned.] ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD [Prepared statement, responses to written questions, and additional material supplied for the record follow:] Prepared Statement of Ms. Shalanda D. Young [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] EXECUTIVE BUSINESS MEETING TO CONSIDER THE NOMINATION OF MS. SHALANDA D.

The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at : p.m., in Room S- , The Capitol, Hon. Bernard Sanders, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Sanders, Murray, Wyden, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Warner, Merkley, Kaine, Van Hollen, Lujan, Padilla, Graham, Grassley, Crapo, Toomey, Johnson, Braun, Sasse, and Romney. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BERNARD SANDERS Chairman Sanders. Okay, ladies and gentlemen. I call the Committee meeting to order. The question before the Committee is the nomination of Shalanda Young to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The past years, Ms. Young has served as a top staffer on the House Appropriations Committee and has done an excellent job working with Democrats and Republicans on legislation that must be passed each and every year that impacts the lives of tens of millions of Americans. There is no doubt that she is highly qualified for this position and I strongly support her nomination. Senator Graham, would you like to make a speech on this issue? OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM Senator Graham. Yes, it will take or minutes. The bottom line is Senator Shelby tells me she has been great to work with on budget matters and appropriations. But the statement that she gave in response to Senator Hawley's question about the Hyde Amendment is troubling to many of our members. So I am going to vote yes with the understanding she has to answer one additional question. She said in her statement that she would follow the law. I think every regulation in the country comes across her desk and I want her to assure me that if there is a regulation proposed by the Biden administration that changes Hyde or chips away at it that the statutory provisions prevail. So I am going to vote yes, Mr. Chairman, with that understanding. And if she does not give the right answer, I am going to change my vote. Chairman Sanders. Okay. Do we have a quorum present? I think we do. I note that a quorum is present and urge a yes vote on this nomination. We will vote that the Committee report the nomination to the Senate with a recommendation that the nominee be confirmed. The clerk will call the roll. The Clerk. Ms. Murray. Senator Murray. Aye.

COMBATING TERRORISM: ASSESSING THE THREAT OF A BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS ATTACK ---------- FRIDAY, OCTOBER , House of Representatives, Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs and International Relations, Committee on Government Reform, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at a.m., in room , Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Christopher Shays (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Shays, Putnam, Gilman, Platts, Allen, Schakowsky, and Clay. Staff present: Lawrence J. Halloran, staff director and counsel; R. Nicholas Palarino, senior policy advisor; Thomas Costa, professional staff member; Jason M. Chung, clerk; David Rapallo, minority counsel; and Earley Green, minority assistant clerk. Mr. Shays. I would like to call this hearing to order and welcome our panel and our guests. Before September , assessing the threat of biological terrorism was disdained by some as little more than an academic or a bureaucratic exercise. Today, as we worry about access to crop dusters and suspicious anthrax exposures in Florida, a clear-eyed, a fully informed view of the threat imposed by weaponized pathogens is a national security imperative. But we still have no comprehensive threat assessment and achieving that essential perspective remains a challenge. Assessing the threat of bioterrorism requires a sober judgment about the motivations, intentions and capabilities of people so intoxicated with hate and evil, they would kill themselves in the act of killing others. The questions that confound the assessment process, when and where will terrorists use biological weapons against us, how will the agent be disbursed, for what type and magnitude of attack should we be prepared. Available answers offer little comfort and less certainty in assessing the threat. Some conclude the technical difficulties of large scale production and efficient dissemination reduce the likelihood terrorists will use lethal agents to inflict mass casualties anytime soon. Others think those barriers have been or will soon be overcome. Still others believe that neither large quantities nor wide dispersions are required to inflict biological terror. From this cacophony of plausible opinions, those charged with formulating a national counterterrorism strategy must glean a rational estimate about the irrational possibility of biological attack. Perhaps the most difficult dimension of the threat to assess is the deep-seated, almost primal fear engendered by the prospect of maliciously induced disease. For the terrorists, that fear is a potent force multiplier capable of magnifying a minor manageable outbreak into a major public crisis. Failure to account for this unique aspect of biological terrorism understates the threat, increasing our vulnerability. Overstating the threat based on fear alone invites overreaction in which we waste scarce resources and terrorize ourselves with Draconian security restrictions. If you live in a flood plane, you plan for the -year or even - year flood. You don't expect every flood to reach the -year level. If the least likely but worst case scenario dominates your planning, you would spend every day sitting on the roof in a raincoat waiting for the catastrophic deluge. Instead, accepting some risk, you would prudently assess the likelihood of storm surge, buy an extra case of water and some flashlights and go on about your life. After September , we all live in a bio-terrorism flood plain and we should plan accordingly. A workable assessment of the biological threat demands an open discussion of risks, vulnerabilities and fears. It is that discussion we continue today. It is the discussion we will have again October , when Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and others will appear before the subcommittee to discuss the role of vaccines in our near term and long-term preparedness against biological attack. We truly welcome our witnesses and thank them for sharing their time, their expertise and their opinions with us today. At this time, I think we will recognize our senior and most experienced member, the gentleman from New York. You have the floor. Mr. Gilman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank you for holding today's hearing to examine the overall threat posed by biological terrorism and the steps needed to be taken by our government to establish an effective response to a biological weapons attack. But I want to commend you, too, for your continual efforts to try to prepare our government for all kinds of emergencies that we may be experiencing as a result of terrorism. Your recent meeting yesterday where we shared thoughts with some of our experts on anti-terrorism, an informal meeting, but a highly experienced group that was giving us some thoughts that we shared together; the fractionalization hearing on our Government's efforts spread through so many of our agencies; lack of threat assessment; the need for force protection; domestic preparedness; detection technology; hearings on anthrax, chemical warfare. You ought to be commended for this extremely intensive review of our government's programs to prepare our Nation better for these kinds of problems. And I don't think we can commend you enough for your continual efforts in this area. For many years, the possibility of a biological terrorist attack occurring in our Nation seemed absurd, something to be relegated to the realm of science fiction. Regrettably, the barbaric events of September th, have sharply focused our national attention on terrorism and have underscored our vulnerability to future attacks. Indeed, the bioterrorism debate has been transformed from a question of if to the seeming inevitably of when and how. The task of developing an overall strategy to successfully counteract any domestic act of biological terrorism has proven to be a difficult challenge for our Federal and State policymakers. Yet, there can be no doubt that there is now a sense of urgency for the resolution of this task that was not critical before this. Biological terrorism is now at the fore of our national agenda. There has been a great deal of debate in recent years about the nature of the biological terror, both in terms of where the threat originates, what specific agents pose the greatest danger. So far, the media has focused its attention on anthrax and smallpox, yet those represent merely two of the many agents which conceivably could be utilized by terrorists in any future attack. Since September th, we have been engaged in a war on terrorism. The President has told us it is going to be a long, protracted struggle which we all recognize; the very real potential of additional attacks on our own soil. The FBI just yesterday warned us of the possibility of an imminent attack. Given that, it is in our interest to place greater effort on identifying both the capability of those who are likely to use biological weapons against us as well as to be able to develop effective counterterrorism measures and responses to any future attack. I look forward, along with my colleagues, to the testimony that we are going to hear from our distinguished panel of witnesses, and I am certain that their experience and insight will prove helpful to us and to this committee as Congress works to find its role in this suddenly urgent and vexing issues. So once again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your outstanding leadership on these important topics. And I hope you will continue in that vein. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Thank you, Mr. Chairman yourself. And I would say whatever compliments go to the staff. We have an excellent staff on this committee. At this time, I would recognize the vice-chairman of the committee, Adam Putnam and see if he has any statement. Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your continued leadership on this issue. As everyone in this room knows, this subcommittee has held more hearings on the threats from terrorism, including chemical and biological weapons, more than any other committee in the Congress, and we appreciate your continued leadership and look forward to the testimony from this panel. Mr. Shays. Thank the gentleman. Mr. Platts. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just echo the comments of my colleagues and our appreciation for your leadership in holding these very important hearings and to convey my sincere thanks to our witnesses here today, to share your expertise on a critically important issue and at a very relevant time in our Nation's struggles against threats from others. So thank you for being here. Mr. Shays. Before I recognize the witnesses, I just want to thank the members of this committee for being strong and active participants. Just recognizing our witnesses and then I will swear you all in and we will take your testimony. We have Raymond Decker, Director of Defense Capabilities Management Team, U.S. General Accounting Office. He is going to talk about threat and risk assessment and how it is done, more or less. We will have Ken Alibek, who is the former deputy head of the Soviet Union bioweapons program and an author of Biohazard and president of Advanced Biosystems, Inc. John Parachini, a policy analyst for RAND Corp., biological threat and terrorist groups. I think you will be addressing that issue and others. Gerald Post, professor of psychiatry, political psychology and international affairs, George Washington University, who will share with us the motivation of terrorists. And it is my understanding, Dr. Post, that you have probably interviewed more terrorists than most anyone else. We have an excellent panel. Just truly an excellent panel. I would like to invite you all to stand and swear you in. We swear in all our panelists. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Shays. Everyone has responded in the affirmative. Thank you very much and have a seat. I am going to ask unanimous consent that all members of the subcommittee be permitted to place an opening statement in the record and the record remain open for days for that purpose. Without objection, so ordered. I ask further unanimous consent that all witnesses be permitted to include their written statement in the record. Without objection, so ordered. We are going to go in the order that I called you. And let me say on the outset that I am very appreciative of the fine work that the General Accounting Office does. And I am also grateful, Mr. Decker, that you don't say you need to have a separate panel and that you are willing to participate in a larger panel. Maybe that doesn't seem unusual to you, but some in the government like to have their own panel. So I want to put on the record, thank you. It makes it easier for us to have a dialog. So you're on, Mr. Decker. STATEMENTS OF RAYMOND DECKER, DIRECTOR, DEFENSE CAPABILITIES MANAGEMENT TEAM, U.S. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE; KEN ALIBEK, PRESIDENT, ADVANCED BIOSYSTEMS, INC.; JOHN PARACHINI, POLICY ANALYST, RAND CORP.; AND JERROLD POST, M.D., PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY, POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY Mr. Decker. Chairman Shays and members of the subcommittee, I am pleased to be here this morning to discuss the issue of combating terrorism and an approach for managing the risk from terrorism directed at our homeland. Over the past several years, we have examined and reported on Federal efforts to combat terrorism to include weapons of mass destruction at the request of this committee and others. Our body of work includes over products, based on information gleaned from a range of sources to include Federal, State and local governments, foreign governments and private entities. The events of last month and the long-term aspects of the national engagement to combat terrorism highlight the need for effective near and long-term actions at all levels of government as well as in the private sector. The designation of a focal point within the Executive Office of the President to lead the Office of Homeland Security is a positive step. As Governor Ridge begins to craft a national strategy to effectively prepare the Nation from future attacks, we believe a risk management approach is essential to underpin decisions which identify requirements, set priorities, direct actions and allocate resources. A risk management is a balanced systematic and analytical process to evaluate the likelihood that a threat will endanger an asset and identify actions to reduce the risk and mitigate the consequences of an attack. We believe a good risk management approach should have three key elements, threat assessments, vulnerability assessments and criticality assessments. Allow me to briefly discuss each assessment. A threat assessment is an important process that identifies and evaluates threats using various factors such as capability, intention, past activity and potential lethality of attacks. At the national level, the Central Intelligence Agency and other agencies of the intelligence community are responsible for those assessments that involve international terrorist threats. The Federal Bureau of Investigation gathers information and assesses the threat posed by domestic sources of terrorism. In , and again, in our most recent report on combating terrorism, which was released last month--and this is A , we had recommended that the FBI prepare a formal intelligence assessment that assesses the chemical and biological agents that could be used by domestic terrorists without the assistance or support of a foreign entity. The FBI concurred and expects to complete the assessment in December of this year. Additionally, we recommended that the FBI produce a national level threat assessment using intelligence estimates and input from the intelligence community and others to form the basis for and to prioritize programs developed to combat terrorism to include weapons of mass destruction. Again, the FBI concurred and expects to complete this classified study later this month. Mr. Chairman, as you know, in April , we released a report on how other countries, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Israel are organized to combat terrorism. And we noted that these five countries place great emphasis on threat assessments which address the likelihood of attack. Since they stress their primary objective is prevention, these assessments have a significant importance in their planning and a response depending events. However, I must caution that since all attacks may not be prevented, the following two assessments are essential in preparation. A vulnerability assessment identifies weaknesses in physical structures, security systems, plans, procedures and a variety of other areas that could be exploited by terrorists. For example, a common physical vulnerability might be the close proximity of a parking area near a building or structure with the obvious concern being a vehicle laden with explosives. Normally, a multi-disciplinary team of experts in engineering, security, information systems, health and other areas normally would conduct this vulnerability assessment. Teams within an organization can perform these assessments, which is the case used by the Department of Defense. In a report, GAO report, we noted that a major U.S. multinational firm used the same approach to better focus its efforts in overseas facilities. The final assessment is the criticality assessment, and these are designed to identify which assets are most important to an organization's mission or represent a significant target which merit enhanced protection. For example, nuclear power plants, key bridges, major computer networks might be identified as critical assets based on national security or economic importance. Some facilities might be critical at certain times and not at other times. For example, sports stadiums or a shopping center filled with people might represent a critical asset. Typically, the affected organization would perform its own criticality assessment. And we note that the report of the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in the U.S. seaports issued late last year, stress the need for these assessments in conjunction with threat and vulnerability assessments. Mr. Chairman, simply stated, one must know as much as possible about threat, identify one's weaknesses to potential attack and determine which assets are most important and require special attention in order to make sound decisions on preparedness while leveraging limited resources. I have one caveat about threat assessments. Our national goal is to understand the threat and create assessments to guide our actions. To this end, there are continuous efforts by the intelligence and law enforcement communities to assess foreign and domestic threats to the Nation. However, even with these efforts, we may never have enough information on all threats. So there may be a tendency to use worst-case scenarios in this situation. Since worst-case scenarios focus on vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities are almost unlimited and would require exhaustive resources, we believe it is essential that a careful balance exist using all three assessment elements in preparing and protecting against threats. In summary, threat, vulnerability and criticality assessments, when completed and evaluated together in a risk management-based approach, will allow leaders and managers to make key decisions which will better prepare against potential terrorist attacks that may include weapons of mass destruction. If this risk management approach were adopted throughout the Federal Government and by other segments of society, we believe a more effective and efficient preparation in-depth against acts of terrorism directed at our homeland could be affected. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement and I will be pleased to respond to any questions that the committee may have. Mr. Shays. Thank you, Mr. Decker. It is a very helpful statement. And we will definitely have questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Decker follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Shays. Dr. Alibek. Mr. Alibek. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank very much for inviting me here. And I think my -year long experience in the field of biological weapons and biological weapons defense make me, I hope, at least, experience gives me some right to discuss this issue. Before I came to the United States in , I was scientific leader of this program in the former Soviet Union. I was responsible for a large number of scientists and technicians involved in this program. Mr. Shays. The rumor is it was , . Mr. Alibek. , people and about facilities involved in research and development of biological weapons and research and development in defense against biological weapons. And we were on both sides to develop weapons and to develop defense. And now we know in this country, in the United States, we have a great deal of confusion when we discuss biological weapons and biological weapon threat. Some experts discuss and say biological weapons present very significant threat. Some people say no, it is not a threat whatsoever. In my opinion, makes us as disarmed and we don't pay much attention to necessity to the structure of biological weapons defense. The problem is this: We discuss in many cases--we discuss anthrax. We discuss smallpox. We discuss some ways to analyze biological weapons and whether or not it is difficult. But the problem is this: This issue is much wider and bigger because when we discuss biological weapons, what we need to keep in mind are several dozen biological agents could be used in biological weapons. There are many deployment techniques. And these techniques are not just aerosol deployment. There are many others. It is not a situation where someone has to develop a very sophisticated device to deploy biological weapons. These techniques could be, I would say, used with very primitive devices. And, you know, many such things, in my opinion, make biological weapons very dangerous, and very effective weapons could be used. And some people ask why biological weapons? What is the difference between biological weapons, nuclear weapons or regular conventional weapons? In my opinion, biological weapons have a very significant attractiveness because of many reasons. As I said before, a number of different agents could be used; many, many different techniques. And the great diversity of biological weapons make them effective weapons. And what is important to keep in mind, biological weapons impose infectious diseases, and each biological weapon could result in absolutely different consequences. I provided, with some examples, for example, smallpox, anthrax, plague and Marburg infections. And what I would like to say it's just a small number of examples, but if you analyze all these agents and weapons, you could see how diversified these weapons are. And unfortunately, our understanding of biological weapons is not, I would say, comprehensive enough. What we need to do now, we need to rectify our understanding and knowledge of biological weapons. As soon as we start understanding what is a real threat to biological weapons, we start understanding what kind of defense we need to develop. The problem is this: If we still consider existing approaches in developing defense against biological weapons are perfect approaches, or plausible approaches, in my opinion, we make significant mistake. What I notice when we discuss this issue--when I read many testimonies or articles, we discuss antibiotics. We discuss vaccines. I have nothing against antibiotics. In many cases, they could protect against bacterial biological weapons. But when we discuss vaccines, there is a very important situation why we discuss vaccines. We discuss vaccines as a possible protection for troops or in some other scenarios. Vaccines are not good protection against--in the case of bioterrorism. And you know, when we discuss and assess to spend much money to develop vaccines, it causes a significant question. Why? Vaccine needs to be introduced well in advance first. You are not capable to vaccinate entire population. You have no idea against what agent you need to vaccinate people and so on and so forth. And there is another issue. Many vaccines have not developed yet. But we continue pushing this vaccine issue at the same time, you know, in my opinion, it shifts us toward wrong direction. What we need to keep in mind in the medical defense, there are three major areas: Prophylactics or prophylaxes we call it, urgent prophylactics and treatment. And, you know, when we spend our major resources to develop vaccines, we don't spend much time or resources to develop treatment and to develop urgent prophylaxes. In my opinion, it is a significant mistake that needs to be corrected. There is another issue--it is just one of the part of biological weapons. Mr. Shays. Say that last point over again--the last point. Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, when we discuss a necessity to develop new vaccines, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop new vaccines, we are making a very significant mistake because vaccines are not a good protection in bioterrorism. Now we have got many agencies, many departments involved in this business. We know that these agencies and these departments have many subcontractors working in this field. But you know when we try to understand what is the scope of the problem and what the scope of the work, for example, their agencies and departments do, in my opinion, it wouldn't be possible just to create more or less comprehensive and truthful picture. In my opinion, the problem is this: We still suffer lack of coordination between these agencies. And do you know if we don't realize there is time just to develop a completely new system, we should include, in my opinion, a necessity to establish a new agency, agency which would be responsible completely just to work in the field of biodefense. And this agency would have responsibility and would have overall authority and would be able just to manage and revise what is being done by any agency, by any department in the United States. In this case, this agency would be able to establish a system, I would say, highly centralized system to develop protection against biological weapons. The problem is this. We live in democratic country, but when we talk about national security issues or when you talk about bioterrorism and possible huge number of casualties, there is no democracy here. It must be highly centralized and very effective system. Thank you. Mr. Shays. Thank you, Dr. Alibek. [The prepared statement of Mr. Alibek follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Shays. We will now go to Mr. Parachini. Mr. Parachini. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the privilege and opportunity to testify here. Since the tragic events of September th, many Americans have become concerned about the prospect of biological terrorism. After all, it seems plausible that hijackers willing to kill themselves, those aboard commercial airliners and thousands more in the World Trade Center and Pentagon might be willing to use biological agents to kill indiscriminately. Yet it is important to maintain some perspective of the relative dangers. th century history of warfare, terrorism and crime involving biological agents is much less deadly than that of the history with conventional explosives. While history is not a perfect guide to the future, it does provide a context for our thinking about the future. We need to take account of history and hedge against the seeming imponderables of the future. When it comes to the feasibility of using biological weapons, States are more likely to have the resources, technical capabilities, organizational capacity to assemble the people, know-how, material and equipment to produce such weapons and to be able to clandestinely deliver them to valued targets. Mustering the resources and capabilities to inflict devastating strikes with biological agents has proved to be formidable tasks even for States. While some terrorist groups may attempt large scale biological attempts, perpetrating an attack on a scale as that of September th is not likely. At the moment, only States are able to perpetrate clandestinely biological attacks and they are extremely reluctant to do so. Limited attacks using biological agents as common as salmonella and as rare as anthrax are possible. But the scope and scale of such attacks will be modest. On balance, then, a State's ability to command resources and organize them for certain priorities scientific and industrial objectives presents the potential for the greatest threat in bioterrorism. What is more likely than a conscious decision by a country's command authority is that an unauthorized faction within a State might take it upon itself to use a subnational group to do its dirty group. The alleged involvement of the Iranian Government's security services in the attack on American military personnel in Khobart Towers seems to be an example of this type of involvement. When it comes to the feasibility of biological terrorism perpetrated by subnational groups and individuals, the range of capability and the level of consequence depends on whether the groups or individuals are State-sponsored or not. High consequence biological attacks would probably require the assistance of a State sponsor or some other source of considerable resources. Money, arms, logistical support training, even training on how to operate in a chemically contaminated environment, are all forms of assistance States have provided to terrorists. But historically, they have not crossed the threshold and provided biological weapons material to insurgency groups or terrorist organizations. Natural question at this time is whether an organization such as al Qaeda with the financial support of Osama bin Laden might be able to amass the resources for a significant biological attack. Think as we consider this possibility, we need to not only look at the opportunities, but the disincentives. Too often we envision what we fear and do not take into account the thinking of somebody else. We think they are thinking like we fear as opposed to how they are thinking. And I think the most important thing I would draw your attention to is that terrorists have readily turned to more available alternatives, explosives. And indeed, on September th, they took an ordinary means of modern transportation and turned it into an extraordinary killing device. The only two cases we have where terrorists have used biological weapons, one in , where it was a religious cult group, the Rajneeshee, and another years later by the Aum Shinrikyo. Neither of these inflicted the level of casualties that are regularly the product of conventional explosives. Both of these cases had unusual aspects to them and unusual aspects about their leadership. They were obsessed with poisoning. There were limits on what these groups could do. It is very different than that which can be perpetrated by a State. Let me conclude by saying that the possibility is remote of a mass scale biological weapons attack. Small scale attacks, biocrimes, like we may see in Florida, are possible. The government has the responsibility to do all that it can to prevent, protect and respond to events that seem unlikely. The challenge is to determine how much to prepare for a low probability, albeit potentially catastrophic attack, while at the same time guarding against not focusing enough on more probable events with significant but not necessarily catastrophic consequences. With that, Mr. Chairman, let me conclude. And I will be glad to answer any questions you or the members of the committee have. Mr. Shays. Thank you very much for your testimony and we will have a number of questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Parachini follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Shays. Dr. Post, you can end this panel and then we will start with the questions. Dr. Post. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am honored to have the opportunity of addressing you on this important topic. A great deal of attention has been paid to the vulnerability of American society and what terrorists could do. I will be confining my remarks to what terrorists would do and wouldn't do, what their motivations and incentives are and what their constraints are for committing acts of the chem- bioterrorism. First, a note of vocabulary. There is a term often in use and I hope that this committee can play a role in killing this term and that is, weapons of mass destruction terrorism. It is an unfortunate term that is all too readily used. Certainly on September th, we saw mass destruction terrorism, indeed catastrophic super terrorism perpetrated in the guise of conventional terrorism. Similarly, the so-called weapons of mass destruction, chem- bio, radiological, nuclear, in fact, can be used with exquisite precision to the point of being able to kill a single individual in an assassination. Let me first take the committee rather swiftly through the spectrum of terrorism. I am going to attempt to both differentiate the threat by group and by attack type. And these remarks are elaborated in my prepared statement. You will see---- Mr. Shays. Now we have one in front of the table--you can't see it, but if we are looking down, don't think we are not paying attention. Dr. Post. First, across the top and differentiating, this is really quite variegated spectrum of terrorist groups. We have crusaders, criminals and crazies. Let me emphasize as a psychiatrist who has been working and understanding terrorist psychology, terrorists are not crazed psychotics despite the often misinterpretation of the public. In fact, terrorist groups expel emotionally disturbed members from their groups. They are a security risk. At the middle tier, I note in particular State-supported terrorism. As Mr. Parachini stated a moment ago, this is of grave concern for the reasons he indicated, in terms of the resources necessary, and I will come back to that in a moment. I will be focusing on the motivations and constraints for the sub State groups. First, across the left, we have social revolutionary terrorism. This is the groups who were particularly prominent during the 's and 's, red brigades, Red Army faction in this country, the Weather Underground following Marxist, Leninist doctrine. Still present, though, we have Japanese Red Army, a number Colombian social revolutionary groups as well. Right wing terrorism on the rise. In fact, a number of the small attacks of chemical biological terrorism have come from individual extremists within the right wing fringe. Nationalist separatist terrorism refers to the groups seeking to have an independent nation, be it the provisional Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland who have heard about the troubles from their fathers and grandfathers in the publics of northern Ireland or the radical Palestinian terrorists hearing of the lands taken from their families in the coffee houses of Beirut in the occupied territories. Of particular concern is the group that I have labeled religious extremist terrorism, both including new religions such as Aum Shinrikyo, which gave us the event which precipitated in many ways the major concern with this, the sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subways and religious extreme and religious fundamentalist terrorism. And of particular concern now, of course, Islamist radical extremist terrorism. Now if we could have the second graphic, please. What I would like to do now is walk you swiftly through this graphic. Down the left I have the groups I have just mentioned. Across the top, I have noted different types of attack. From my point of view, the major psychological thresholds across is not the weapon type, but the willingness to create mass casualties as was tragically demonstrated on September th. In fact, to echo Mr. Parachini, one could cause mass casualties with conventional weapons as has been done on a number of occasions going back to the Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Mr. Shays. Just announcing that we are going into session at a.m., you know, I say that but I am not necessarily right. I am still confused by this. Am I right guys, are we going into session at a.m., or is that a vote? We'll figure it out later. Dr. Post. I have also noted CBW hoax. I emphasize this because this is insufficiently considered. One can have a very powerful--successful terrorist act without ever spreading a molecule of substance about--and we have insufficiently considered our preparation for this. And finally, small scale attacks, large scale attacks and then the catastrophic attacks of which Mr. Parachini spoke. Now for the first two types, social revolutionary and national separatist groups, they are interested in influencing the west calling attention to their cause. It would be quite counterproductive for them to have either a mass casualty attack or an attack which damaged their constituents. It is possible but remote that they would choose to have a small scale attack that doesn't affect their constituents. Thus a Palestinian group might attack in Tel Aviv, but not in Jerusalem. For the right wing groups, we see some groups who have indeed participated lacking though, in fact, the resource and technology. Let me focus on the last two groups, the religious fundamentalist groups and the new religion terrorist. Here, in my judgment, there is little psychological constraint as has been demonstrated. Indeed, there is a desire to cause extreme casualties. In fact, some of the terrorists I have interviewed are quite interesting in saying there is no moral red line in terms of the amount of destruction. However, here we have, again, an issue where the resources necessary to carry this out are simply not present for the group. And what would be a great hazard here would be if we had a State supporting these groups such as Iraq, which has been one of the areas of concern. In my judgment, we need to be focusing our intelligence resources in particular on the groups of greatest concern, which would be those groups responsible for more than percent of the attacks in recent years where no responsibility has been claimed. They are not interested in influencing the west. They are interested in expelling the west. They don't need that New York Times headline, God knows. And this is the group of greatest concern. But even so, it is not of major concern, from my point of view, in my analytical judgment, in terms of catastrophic attacks. There is a possibility of focal attacks only. And we should not, in overreacting to this, neglect to focus on conventional terrorism because it is conventional terrorism that continues to be the source of mass casualties and continues to be the method of choice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Dr. Post follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Shays. My staff is a little disappointed with you, Dr. Post, because they were enjoying your testimony hoping you would read it. You were talking about religious fundamentalist terrorism and you say they were seeking to influence the west in the establishment. But in the past decades no responsibility's claimed for upwards of percent of terrorist acts. We believe this is because of the increasing frequency of terrorist acts by radical religious extremist terrorists. They're not trying to influence the west, rather, the radical Islamic terrorists are trying to expel the secular modernizing west and they do not need their name identified in a New York Times headline or in a story on CNN. They are ``killing in the name of God,'' and don't need official notice. After all, God knows. Somehow my staff thought that was rather an ingenious statement. So it is on the record, OK, Larry. At this time, I will call on Mr. Putnam. Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the panel for their outstanding opening remarks. My first question is for Dr. Alibek. You have related the history of the Castro regime's involvement in bioweapons development since the early 's, including a comment that you gave to the Miami Herald in . As a Floridian, I am very concerned because Cuba has a hostile regime miles off shore. What information do you have for us on the status of the Cuban regime's production of bioweapons? Mr. Alibek. I think of this question because in , it was quite a confusing situation because when I gave that interview, the State Department issued information saying that they had no information about any Cuban offensive biological weapons problem. But at the same time, Defense Intelligence Agency included Cuba in a group of countries involved in biological weapons activity. But my personal opinion and my personal experience of this, we have some information about this Cuban activity. We knew Cuba was interested in biological weapons research and development work. We knew that there were several centers; one of them was located close to Havana involved in, I would say, in military biological technology. And what was most amazing to us, we consider Cuba is not a well-developed country. But at the same time, Cuba has a very perfectly developed system of engineering and is capable to develop genetic engineering agents. They've got the desire to develop genetically engineered biological weapons. In my opinion, I strongly believe, and I still believe, this country discovered this capability and what the size of this program and what the level of achievement, of course, it is up to our intelligence services. Mr. Putnam. In the course of your work in the Soviet Union and your contacts with some of the Soviet satellite States, was there ever any motivation to develop biological or chemical weapons for the purpose of destroying agricultural crops or agriterrorism as opposed to inflicting mass casualties? Mr. Alibek. You are certainly right when you ask this question because in the Soviet Union, for example, there was a huge program. And this program included several directions and one direction, for example, to develop biological weapons to infect and kill human beings, troops and civilian population. Another was the program by the minister of agriculture. Mr. Shays. Another problem or program? Mr. Alibek. Another program to develop anti-crop and anti- livestock biological weapons. And there were several institutions involved in this business. And they developed, for example, biological weapons like rinderpest, African swine fever, foot in mouth disease, specifically intended to infect livestock. There was another part of this program to destroy crops, wheat, rye, rice and corn. Biological weapons program, they are huge programs and they include many different directions. And undoubt, agricultural weapons are usually a part of large biological weapons programs. Mr. Putnam. Is it safe to say that a number of the researchers who were working on those agricultural programs have now spread out through a number of other nations and regimes since the collapse of the Soviet Union? Mr. Alibek. Yes, you're right. Many of them are now overseas and work for some other countries. From my personal experience I know in the West, just in the West, we've got tens to hundreds of scientists with quite sophisticated biological weapons knowledge. How many of them now in the Middle East or some other countries, we have no idea. But there was some information that some of them left for Iran, for Iraq and for some other countries. Mr. Putnam. Dr. Post, I have a very brief amount of time remaining and so much to ask. From a psychological perspective is there a desire for a number of these regimes to focus on agricultural terrorism, attacking food safety scenarios, or are they more focused on the spectacle of an explosion and bodies in the streets and casualties and things of that sort? Dr. Post. One has to differentiate among both the regimes and the groups. For groups seeking to strike out and damage us, there certainly could be a motivation to strike out in the agricultural area. For groups seeking that terrorist spectacular, to have attention and notice paid to them, that would be much less likely just because of the nature of the manner in which the threat has persisted. This is certainly an area of significant concern from my point of view which has yet not been sufficiently addressed. Mr. Putnam. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Thank the gentleman. Mr. Allen, do you have a question? I'm sorry. I would like to acknowledge that Mr. Allen is here and Ms. Schakowsky and Mr. Clay. Mr. Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you all for being here today. I was struck by some of the differences I detected in Mr. Decker's testimony and Dr. Alibek's, so I would like to sort of push it back to you. I thought I heard Mr. Decker saying--I hope I heard Mr. Decker saying--that we need to go through a risk management process. We need to evaluate all the different threats out there. I thought the outline that you raised was a good one to look at a threat assessment, a vulnerability assessment and a criticality assessment. That's not what we've been doing in this country, and I can't help but think that the whole debate over missile defense would continue to be very different--if we actually looked at the threat of an ICBM being fired at this country in the context of all the different threats we face from states and from terrorist groups, we would approach it differently. And if it didn't feel so much like a crusade on the part of the advocates, those of us who are skeptics might have reacted a little differently. I thought I heard Dr. Alibek saying there really are thousands of different biological agents out there that could be used. The question that I'm interested in is how is it possible for us as a government and as a country, two different things, to start to do real risk management and bringing it to bear in this debate? Here's what I'm thinking: I think the GAO years ago recommended that a threat and risk assessment be developed by the FBI. The FBI said we would do it. I don't know if it's being done. I would like Mr. Decker to respond to that, the status of the recommendations and so on. But my overall question for any of you is, should we be asking different agencies like the FBI or the CIA or the Department of Defense to do separate threat and risk assessments and then try to get those separate assessments, kind of evaluate them, or do we want these different agencies to set up a structure that will allow them to do the threat and risk assessments together? Because I think we are in trouble if we just let the media take whatever threat is out there, whether it's anthrax day or some other biological agent another day or whatever, if we keep moving from crisis to crisis based on the latest story, we will not be doing our job well. That's a bit rambling. But what I'm looking for is some advice on the approach we could take to get to a more disciplined analysis of the threats and vulnerabilities that are out there. Maybe, Mr. Decker, you should begin. I have taken too much time. I apologize. [The prepared statement of Hon. Thomas H. Allen follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Decker. Sir, let me start with one piece of this. In kind of looking at what Governor Ridge has to do, he's leading an Office on Homeland Security. We're not sure what that homeland security truly means. But if you read the Executive order, clearly it's to combat acts of terrorism. That's pretty clear. One aspect of working on a national strategy has to be an understanding of the threat. Understanding the threat and threat assessments are two slightly different issues. One, the understanding of threat is something that is continuous, it's long term, it has hooks into the past, just like Mr. Parachini mentioned, that allows you then to do a threat assessment which I would make the analogy is more like a snapshot in time. It gives you an appreciation for a lot of different factors that can be used in a quantifiable way to make certain decisions. Now, the issue that I would raise, sir, is there are agencies, organizations that are better prepared and better structured and based on their mission to do threat assessments. I do think that the threat assessments, that process in the intelligence community and to a lesser degree with the law enforcement community, there is a difference in approach and model. But with the intelligence community they probably do good assessments at the national level, looking at specific issues, long-term issues, and these are typically call national intelligence estimates. These estimates, these assessments provide a road map, if you will, on understanding an issue that I would submit other experts should use when you do risk management. Risk management basically is a discussion. It's a conversation with people of different disciplines, different backgrounds, different perspectives, that are experts in an area to be able to make sense out of what the threat implication is to our assets. And to make sense out of that, you have to know a lot about yourself. What's vulnerable and has most important? So, at the national level, you could have a threat assessment and a real good one of everything that you know to date and then you have to put that into context. How would it affect my vulnerabilities? How does it exploit my weakness? What is most important that I have to protect and at what degree? And that's where leadership comes in to make those hard decisions. What is an acceptable level of risk once I consider all these factors? Mr. Allen. So you're talking about sorting out the large number of risks that Dr. Alibek was referring to, for example? Mr. Decker. Yes. Mr. Alibek. If I may, I'm not against a necessity that you do risk assessment. I am not against a necessity to do a risk assessment. But, you know, I feel always a sort of resistance, reluctance when we discuss a necessity to develop a sort of priority, what is more likely and what is less likely and so on and so forth. Let me give you a couple of examples. In the early 's, before I came to the United States, there was a work--I would call it risk assessment work in the field of biological weapons. This work was done by some intelligence services here in the United States, and the recommendations was sent to the Department of Defense. And, you know, according to that assessment, the most threat in biological weapons in the future would be bacterial biological weapons and toxin biological weapons. Resulting from this assessment, the entire division of the Institute of Medical Defense, medical research, was eliminated, division which was responsible for protection against biological weapons in 's. And for years it didn't exist. After some people came from the East and said, OK, guys let's analyze what we are having here in this field, what was the result? Yes, biological weapons would--the most effective biological weapons would be bacterial and viral biological weapons. Toxins in terms of military deployment wouldn't be very effective. It was the result of many years study done in the Soviet Union and, unfortunately, in some other countries. In this case, you can imagine this type of approach led to the entire destruction of the entire division and entire direction in biological weapons defense. If we use this approach, in my opinion, we--again, we're going to make the same mistake we already made before in our history. Mr. Shays. Could I just jump in, if the gentleman would yield, even though his time has run out, I would like them all to go through and answer your question. But I would just intuitively respond that maybe the assessment wasn't done properly. And I would also say that it would strike me that you have to update your assessment every year. So that if you had updated your assessment every year, you might not have found the result that you ended up with. Mr. Alibek. Of course, the problem is this: My position when we discuss biological threat and bioterrorism, you know, I am saying, that's right. There are many different agents would be used. There are many techniques could be used. But it's not a situation in which we are not able to do a comprehensive analysis and to develop a new understanding, contemporary modern understanding of biological weapon threat. It's not something impossible. We can do this. It's only a problem in this case to find right professionals to do this assessment. Mr. Shays. Mr. Parachini and Mr. Post, you both want to respond to his question? Then I will go to Ms. Schakowsky. Mr. Parachini. I was struck in Mr. Decker's response by his emphasis as an important part of the threat assessment being intentions. And to underline your comments, Mr. Allen, you spoke about some of the skepticism. Let's go back to the cold war. We tended in retrospect to overevaluate the threat from the Soviet Union because we were paying too much attention to capability and insufficient attention to intention. In dealing with closed societies and closed groups and organizations such as al Qaeda, we are significantly impaired from making intelligence estimates of intention and therefore tend to go to the worst-case scenario. This really emphasizes how crucial it is to be able to get into the heads of our adversaries more effectively than we have been at the present time. Mr. Shays. The challenge with that, though, is intentions can change from moment to moment but capability may be a little more long term. So we could--it would strike me we could think we know their intention but their intention could change overnight. Dr. Post. I don't see it quite that way, that intentions change from moment to moment. There is a linear track. Now, having said that, certainly Osama bin Laden is a remarkably innovative leader. He has spoken in almost taunting fashion about his willingness to use such weapons, which in itself is often terrifying. Mr. Allen. The only thing I would add to that in response is that when you're trying--it's different, I think, trying to gauge the intention of a terrorist group, which has a pretty clearly stated mission in this case, as compared to a state, a country which isn't going to move anywhere. And part of the debate about missile defense and the question of intentions is the fact that missiles that are launched can be traced right back to the site from which they were launched. But I don't mean to drag that whole debate into this one. Dr. Post. Just to elaborate on your point, though, the goal of no state is to terrorize. They will use terrorism to support their foreign policy goals, but when it becomes counterproductive for the state they are deterred just by the factors you illuminate. When you have a group whose primary goal is in fact to create terror in the service of coercion--and I think it should be remembered terrorism is at heart psychological warfare. It's violence as communication. It's designed to accomplish goals through creating terror, not through proliferation of bodies. Mr. Shays. Ms. Schakowsky, you have been very patient. Thank you very much. You have the floor. Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you for continuing what you started well before September th in looking into these matters. In that regard, I want to credit Representative Tierney for some questions that he asked and wanted to ask today that--he is not here right now. On June th and July th, this subcommittee held hearings on the biological weapons convention; and this international treaty, which was signed in , has signatories prohibiting states from developing biological agents for offensive purposes. The problem that was acknowledged was that this treaty contains no inspection provisions and relies on international political pressure to ensure that there is compliance. And, as you stated in your recommendations, Dr. Alibek, that for many years the Soviet Union was able to hide an enormous biological weapons program. So, clearly, inspections is an issue. The last administration developed a protocol that would establish an inspection regime; and the current administration has, for unknown reasons, ``concluded that the current version of the protocol would be inefficient in stopping cheating.'' At the July th hearing Mr. Tierney asked the administration witness, Ambassador Mahley, if he had prepared an analysis of the objections to this draft protocol which would require inspections. He said he had. He said that he would provide it. There was a motion that was adopted in the subcommittee, and then there was a request in writing. Three months have passed, and so Mr. Tierney has asked that the subcommittee take active measures, Mr. Chairman, to obtain that report by Ambassador Mahley that was promised months ago. While we understand that these are very busy times for the administration, but it seems to me that just delivering a report that was already done is a reasonable request. So I want to---- Mr. Shays. Would the gentlelady yield? It's an absolutely reasonable request. We have requested it, and we'll go back and ask that it be provided. Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Mr. Tierney and myself as well. I wanted to then ask the panel if it is your belief, considering we've been talking about how you develop threat assessment, the relationship of state programs and terrorist programs developing biological weapons, whether or not this protocol requiring inspection would give us, in fact, another level of protection and if it's possible in your view to implement such a protocol effectively. Anyone who wishes to respond. Mr. Parachini. I think part of the question is whether the protocol helps or hurts. And the intention is clearly to help, but it in itself will not be sufficient. I think part of the problem of arms control in the post cold war period is that our expectations have been very high. Yet it has been very difficult to pinpoint in a multilateral context the security problems that we face with an arms control tool. So the arms control tool will be useful but not sufficient. My understanding of what Ambassador Mahley has said was that the administration wants to think about this in a much broader way and not be locked into just seeing the BWC as the way to address the problem, that there is a whole range of other tools such as regulating more effectively commerce and infectious diseases. We have some regulations in the United States, but on an international basis it's an open market. Pathogens are traded around the world without any of the normal controls. Disease surveillance, something that the committee I know has looked at several times, we're getting a little better at it here in the United States. But we're in a global environment. Global surveillance in other parts of the world where emerging infectious diseases are appearing is not near at the level ours is, and most public health officials in the United States say ours is not adequate. So these are very different tools other than arms control to address this problem. Ms. Schakowsky. Is there a counterproposal to the protocol? Mr. Parachini. That is part of the challenge that the administration is on the hook for, to provide that. These are not easy solutions, and it's not easy to come up with a package of new things. This is a totally new environment, and I commend the administration for trying to do some new thinking. Their challenge is to do it in a speedy fashion. Mr. Alibek. If I may, a small addition, in , I was a part of this process called a three-lateral agreement between the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union to inspect or visit some biological weapons facilities--or suspected of being biological weapons facilities. Now I know one of the biggest problems was to prove whether or not one or another facility was actually--is it a BW facility or defense facility? It's one of the problems. But when we discuss a new protocol, I envision three major problems. First problem is this: Terrorist organizations, they don't sign any treaties. And for them, of course, it doesn't matter what kind of protocol we sign. It's not going to affect their activity. Second problem, we say, for example, one of the reasons a new administration---- Ms. Schakowsky. To the extent they may use state-run facilities to advance their agenda. Mr. Alibek. Yes, that is right. But the problem is this when we discuss biological weapons--you know, my biggest concern is this. When people say biological weapons require many efforts, we wouldn't see any significant events. We use some examples cited, Aum Shinrikyo--I feel a very significant resistance because we use absolute incorrect examples. The problem is this. When we use example of Aum Shinrikyo, nobody pays attention. But Aum Shinrikyo was not capable to get a virulent strain. What they did, they used a non-virulent strain. That's why they were not able to get any casualties. When we discuss about likelihood of--small likelihood of create a significant terrorist attack, I completely disagree. I know the real power of biological weapons, and I know what kind of results we can get. But you know when we discuss this treaty, one of the biggest problems is this. For example, existing administration, current administration is saying we cannot put our pharmaceutical industry in danger because it will let some inspectors come and see our production facilities and it would cause some significant harm. It's incorrect. As a biotechnologist, if I come to a new facility or any facility and see some equipment, for example, to manufacture one or another product, it says absolutely nothing to me. What I need to know, I need to see specific documentation just to determine whether or not I am able to get some information to use in my own country. Mr. Shays. Could I interrupt the gentleman? You said such a strong statement that no one else has concurred with you. You said it provides you absolutely no information. Let me just make my point. I wouldn't suggest it tells you everything, but it tells you something. I have had more pharmaceutical people tell me that the shape of the pipes, where the pipes--where they connect and so on say a lot about the process that they use to develop the particular pharmaceutical drug. Mr. Alibek. That's not true. First of all, all of technology processes---- Mr. Shays. May I ask you a question? Were you on both sides of this equation or on one side of the equation? Mr. Alibek. On both. Because the problem is this. By technological processes, production facilities, they have quite similar equipment. There are some differences in equipment design, some computer programming to program production facilities. You could see some equipment, for example, special equipment to purify one product. But, you know, the--a major know-how is inside of these columns, not outside. Mr. Shays. I just want to move on. I'm not disagreeing with you now. You said you've been on both sides and your statement will stand on the record. Mr. Alibek. If I may, one more thing. When we include in this protocol, a necessity to inspect, for example, suspected facilities, having four member team and -week notice, in my opinion is a mockery. Because for weeks it's possible to hide any BW production. Mr. Shays. Could I just ask, is it possible to hide it in a day? Mr. Alibek. In small production could be hidden very easily within to -week period. Mr. Shays. Thank you. Mr. Clay, you're on. Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me also thank the witnesses for being here to share with us their knowledge and experience. The purpose of the hearing is among the highest priority that we may have as a country. We have to examine the factors that should be considered in assessing the risk of biological terrorism. Just months ago the subject would have been as serious but would not have had the urgency and the knowledge that this has to be addressed and acted upon post haste. September , , changed any perception that biological terrorism was only a possibility. It is now a probability and, depending on the results of the investigation ongoing in Boca Raton, FL, it may be a reality. However, we must not assume answers before the investigation is complete. The threat is real. It will remain real for the foreseeable future. The American people need both procedures and actions for the knowledge of how to implement those procedures that are established. Mr. Decker, you have repeatedly reported that we as a country lack a comprehensive assessment of the terrorist threats against us. The problem as you describe it is that, without this assessment, we haven't done a comparison and prioritization to allow us to plan intelligently. Is that a correct description of your findings? [The prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Decker. Congressman Clay, that is correct. Mr. Clay. OK. And, as a result, there is a risk that our spending and preparation may be misaligned, is that right? Mr. Decker. I would hope that our investment returns the most interest for the Nation, and I'm not sure that's the case without that threat assessment. Mr. Shays. Your answer was really a yes, right? Mr. Decker. Yes. Mr. Clay. You know, let's talk about preparedness of the American public. I've heard that you can acquire a vaccine for anthrax. Should there be a run on getting that vaccine by the American public? Should we be concerned? And anyone on the panel can answer. Mr. Decker. I'd let my distinguished colleague, Dr. Alibek, comment on that. Mr. Clay. Should there be a run on the anthrax vaccine? Should the American public start---- Mr. Alibek. Let's imagine the situation. We're able to manufacture enough doses of vaccine to vaccinate the entire population of the United States. Theoretically, it's possible, but it would be a significant problem, financial problem, logistical problem and so on and so forth, a medical problem as well. But, at the same time, let's imagine the situation, as I said before, there are many different agents and you vaccinate just against anthrax, it means somebody who has a desire to deploy biological weapons would use something else. Having people vaccinated against anthrax we would force these terrorist groups to develop and to deploy something else-- plague, tuberculosis, something else. When we talk about this, in my opinion it's not a perfect idea to vaccinate people because--keeping in mind that the number of agents is quite large. Any time you vaccinate against one agent you are in danger to be infected by another one. Mr. Clay. One more question, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. You have no problem. Mr. Clay. We agreed that numerous technical problems are there with acquiring, producing and weaponizing biological agents. Mr. Decker, you stated in a past report, ``a leading expert told us that the whole process entails risk. For example, anthrax powders easily adhere to rubber gloves and pose a handling problem. Effectively disseminating the agent can pose technical challenges in that proper equipment and energy sources are needed. A less sophisticated product in dissemination method can cause illness or death.'' As a result of these conclusions, would you say that terrorists or rogue states are more likely to seek out legitimate covers for their illegitimate activities such as pharmaceutical plants or the like? Mr. Decker. Sir, I have no direct evidence to be able to support that, but it would seem likely. Mr. Clay. Likely that they would use these plants as covers? Mr. Decker. I can only state that it would seem logical, but I have no factual documentation to support that. Mr. Clay. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Thank the gentleman. I haven't done my round yet. I'm going to do minutes, then another , then we'll just go back to the other Members. I'd like to go fairly quickly if I can. If we have agreement, so then we not discuss those things, only where there might be disagreement. Mr. Decker has come forward with the whole concept that risk management is a systematic and analytical process to consider the likelihood that a threat will endanger an asset and so on. Then he broke it down into three: threat assessment, vulnerability assessment and critical assessment. The bottom line to a threat assessment is a threat assessment is used to evaluate the likelihood of a terrorist activity against a given asset or location. Then he basically said a vulnerability assessment is a process that identifies weaknesses in fiscal structures and so on. Then he said a criticality assessment is a process designed to systematically identify and evaluate important assets and infrastructures in terms of various factors such as the mission and so on. Do any of you disagree with this as being a framework with which the committee could work in dealing with management, risk management? Does this make sense to you, Dr. Alibek; to you, Mr. Parachini; to you, Dr. Post? Mr. Alibek. In general, it makes sense. Mr. Parachini. Just make sure I understand. Mr. Shays. He's giving us a way to process this. I want to know if you are comfortable with it or whether you would amend it. Mr. Parachini. An important part of this, if I understand what has been proposed, is to factor in motives into the vulnerability assessment. I think that's what Dr. Post has talked about. Too often, we just focus on the vulnerability or we just focus on the criticality, and we don't think what the capabilities put together with motives might produce. So that's an important point. Mr. Shays. OK, did you want to make a point Dr. Alibek? Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, that is correct. But when we discuss risk assessment, my position is still the same. We need to analyze the entire problem and to see what all possible ways to deploy and to develop biological weapons and what agents could be used. You know, I would use a broader definition for risk assessment. Mr. Shays. OK. Well, I'm going to come right back to you in a second. Dr. Post, your issue on motivation, anything else? Dr. Post. I would concur with what John Parachini has just said. And to me this is the weakest aspect of our capability of conducting a thorough risk assessment at this point, an insufficient ability to have the data to make a good evaluation of intentions. Mr. Shays. Let me expose my ignorance, Mr. Decker. I have basically said continually whenever I've had the opportunity that we've had three commissions that have come before us. They said, we don't have a proper assessment of the terrorist threat, we don't have a strategy to deal with a threat, and we aren't organized to maximize our resources to be effective to implement the strategy and succeed against the threat. Now, I've just made this blanket ``we don't have a proper assessment of a threat.'' You're breaking that first one down into parts, correct? Mr. Decker. Not exactly, sir. What I'm saying is, threat assessment by itself is not enough---- Mr. Shays. OK. Mr. Decker [continuing]. To craft a cogent national strategy with effective actions. Mr. Shays. So we need more than threat assessment. Mr. Decker. Yes. Mr. Shays. So you have termed it risk management, and you have divided it into these three things--the threat assessment, vulnerability assessment and criticality assessment. You jumped in, Mr. Parachini, and said, motives go in there. Where would motives go in those three or is it a separate identity? Would it go under threat or would it go--it would go under threat, I guess. And you, Dr. Alibek, would take these three and add something else to it. You spoke too general for me for it to be helpful. Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, what needs to be said--not just threat assessment. Threat assessment, defense assessment is very important. Mr. Shays. What, our capability to respond? Mr. Alibek. Our capability to respond. Mr. Shays. Help me out, Mr. Decker. Where would that go in your line of thinking? Mr. Decker. The risk management approach is when you're looking at preparedness. Mr. Shays. OK. Mr. Decker. We're really talking primarily about the defense, the preparedness of the homeland. Mr. Shays. We're talking about the detection and prevention part of it. Mr. Alibek. Not just the detection and prevention. Of course, prevention is very, very important. When we talk about defense assessment or our preparedness, we need to keep in mind three major issues--detection, prevention and treatment. Mr. Shays. What was the last word? Mr. Alibek. Treatment. Mr. Shays. Treatment? Mr. Alibek. Treatment, yeah. Mr. Shays. How you treat it. OK. My staff understands. Then they make me feel ignorant here. That meant nothing to me. He said it five times--treatment, treatment, treatment--but it doesn't help. What do you mean? Mr. Alibek. The problem, one of the major things, biological weapons cause infectious diseases. In terms of protection---- Mr. Shays. Do you mean response instead of treatment? Mr. Alibek. No, when we discuss response, we need to keep in mind three major directions in medical response. I would say--but not general response. Detection is a technical response, then protection is a medical response, and medical and technical response and treatment. Mr. Shays. Oh, I see. I misunderstood. I was thinking you meant detect the attack. You mean detect--so in that--I understand treatment in that basis. You're saying once there is the like--if you've detected that someone has a pathogen, that they are--they have been ill, you want to detect it, you want to protect them and treat them. Mr. Alibek. That's correct. Mr. Shays. OK. Now I understand. No wonder you thought I was an idiot here. I'm fascinated by your chart, Dr. Post. Because--let me just first get it here--it seems to me you're almost doing what the FBI has done. I'm not being really fair to you, so you'll get a chance to enlighten me. The FBI has said, there will be an attack, you know. It's like we needed to pay the FBI to tell us there will be an attack. We all know there is going to be an attack. We all know it could happen in the next days. We all know it is serious, and we all know it could happen weeks from now. What you did on your scales--on your markings of the X and the star, you basically--you have the check as being less constrained and while still unlikely could rationalize such an act. So the check does not indicate likelihood of committing such an act but refers to motivation only. Well, that maybe answers my question. You're saying that these are not likely but that--help me out. Dr. Post. I'm glad you picked up on that. Because I think the check is somewhat misleading. This doesn't mean they are likely to do this. They are less psychologically and motivationally constrained. Having said that, they still need resource and technology. And if they are succeeding abundantly with conventional terrorism and don't have the handling risk, there is really very little incentive to move forward. The one major caveat in terms of that as I have studied Osama bin Laden, I've regularly been struck by--I think we can reliably predict we will be surprised by him. And he is remarkably innovative. Spends a great deal of time preparing, and then we have a terrorist spectacular. So I am by no means confident he would not move in this direction, not that he can't cause mass casualties with conventional terrorism but because he recognizes the terror that such an act would inflict. Mr. Shays. You want to say something, Mr. Parachini? Mr. Parachini. Let me contrast with Dr. Post on this point. I think there is a certain psychic thrill from the explosion or the dramatic event that a terrorist does not get in the delayed gratification of making people sick with disease. And if there was a way that bin Laden could think about to get that immediate response and there was that immediate sense of fear it might be of greater interest to him, but there are other alternatives that he turns to that he does achieve that. Mr. Shays. Well, a mass exodus of a city because people think there's a biological or chemical attack would give him quite a thrill. Because that would be pretty---- Dr. Post. I do agree with that. I don't want to accuse you of practicing without a license here---- Mr. Shays. You just did. Dr. Post [continuing]. But I do think indeed that part of what has been quite gratifying in his several interviews where he has actually suggested the questions about can bioterrorism has been that this is a way of inflicting terror and the notion of terrorizing the United States is a major source of satisfaction in his mission to be commander in chief of the Islamic world against the West. Mr. Parachini. I think if you look at all those interviews it's actually journalists who raise the question first and then he then responds to it. Dr. Post. That's actually not correct. That was my initial reaction. I've traced that back. The question---- Mr. Shays. This is based on interviews you've had with different---- Dr. Post. No, no. These are CNN, ABC, CBS interviews. Mr. Shays. Did I give you credit for something undeserved? My understanding is that you have had contact and interviewed a number of---- Dr. Post. We just completed a project interviewing incarcerated Middle Eastern terrorists both in Palestinian and Israeli prisons and have a number of really quite dramatic quotes from them. I also served as expert witness in New York in the Federal trial of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Shays. So this is something you have done a lot of research on. Dr. Post. Yes. But on your point I agree with you. There is a satisfaction to the big bang. Having said that, it's quite clear to me that a major motivation for Osama bin Laden, as his last two statements indicated, is inflicting terror. And one gets a great deal--the mere act of doing that in and of itself is sufficient. But that leads me to believe that even a focal chem-bio attack which was then attributed to him would be powerfully magnifying of his stature. Mr. Parachini. Here is where Dr. Alibek makes a very helpful point about treatment and protective measures. It is in our capacity to control the impact of a biological attack which is fundamentally different from a chemical attack where you would have an immediate response. Bin Laden has consistently moved ahead with explosives. He has killed lots of people. The only people who--the only subnational entities that have used biological agents have been people who were obsessed with poisons. And Aum, which is the one we fear the most because they are like bin Laden, had lots of resources, failed in all their attempts, including the case of anthrax where what they used was veterinarian vaccine anthrax. It was not a virulent agent. So this is not as easy to do unless you're possessed to try and do it. Bin Laden is not possessed. He is an operator that we really have to deal with. Dr. Post. To add to that in one other point, several of the radical Islamic terrorists we spoke to indicated that the Koran proscribes the use of poison. And that was a disincentive. Most of the terrorists we interviewed said there was--they would do it if they were ordered to do it, but in fact give me a good Kalashnikov and there was no real consideration of this as a tactic among the radical Islamic terrorists that we had interviewed. Mr. Shays. Let me just say we're going to get back to this whole issue of treatment. Because I have had too many people-- and not right this minute, though, but because I want to give Mr. Gilman a chance and Mrs. Schakowsky to come back. But I just preface it by saying to you, so when I come to my next round, that when I saw the attack on September th I almost physically fell to my knees in the horror of it, like all of us did. The absolute horror of seeing the attack, to see the plane go on another, to see the building just implode, to hear the explosion at the Pentagon. But I think I fell more to my knees because I've had so many hearings where I've had people say to me, credible witnesses, that they have the capability--pleasant sound--we have the capability. And I thought they did, but the only restraint on them was they wouldn't want to have killed so many people. And that went--you know, that just totally--it just flipped on that moment. They were willing to annihilate , people. So I understand your point that these weapons of biological and chemical can be very precise so they can be--they can very much be pinpointed and not a weapon of mass destruction. But they can also be very indiscriminate. Dr. Post. This is true. And your point about the willingness to take mass casualties, one of the questions we asked in our interviews was was there any moral red line in terms of the extent of destruction, the extent of casualties; and for several of the groups, in fact, there are significant red lines that would be counterproductive for their cause. Let me just read: The more an attack hurts the enemy, the more important it is. That is the measure. The mass killings, especially the suicide bombings, were the biggest threat, and so most efforts were devoted to these. The extent of the damage and the number of casualties are of primary importance. In a jihad, there are no red lines. I find that a rather chilling comment. Mr. Shays. It is chilling. Mr. Gilman. Mr. Gilman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. You're going to have minutes. Mr. Gilman. I'm impressed by Dr. Alibek's focus of attention on the fact that we don't have a proper, appropriate coordination amongst our agencies and recommends a single specialized agency to take over. I note that we have organizations with some responsibility in our government. DOD, Defense, Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control, Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, FBI, CIA, NSA and FEMA, all have some responsibility. But there is no coordination, as we found in other areas that we're addressing. I think his recommendation that there should be an agency focused solely on biological terrorism, biological defense is a meritorious one, and I'd like to pursue it, but I'd like our other panelists to give us their views on Dr. Alibek's proposal. Mr. Decker. Mr. Decker. Congressman Gilman, this is the--I think Dr. Alibek's proposal is analogous to some of the comments from the Hart-Rudman Commission when they talk about consolidating certain functions under one organization to deal with border security issues. And the analogy would be obviously dealing with bioissues or---- Mr. Gilman. Do you support the proposal? Mr. Decker. Sir, our agency has not done enough work in this area to determine is it better for the country to have an apparatus like this versus improving what we currently have. Mr. Gilman. Mr. Parachini. Mr. Parachini. This is sort of a novel concept. It's the sort of thing one expects from Dr. Alibek, sort of new thinking. You know, Governor Ridge could take this challenge on, among others. Mr. Gilman. Ridge is going to have a myriad of responsibilities. But Mr. Alibek is recommending that there be one specialized agency. What is your feeling? Yes or no. Mr. Parachini. It might be too narrow of a task. There are already a number of entities within the Pentagon that work on biological defense and critically DARPA does a lot of the research that Dr. Alibek is pointing to. So I would be reluctant to create yet another government agency to address this problem when I think already within the Pentagon there is a fairly robust agency. Mr. Gilman. Well, besides the Pentagon, all of those other agencies I just recited that have some part of it--HHS, DOC, DOJ, CIA, FBI and NSA, FEMA--it seems to me you need some centralized authority. Mr. Parachini. There is a natural inclination to find a central organization to coordinate. If we can accomplish integration without necessarily overlaying another layer of---- Mr. Gilman. How do you get integration with all of these agencies out there? Mr. Parachini. Some of the interagency processes I think function very well. It's a matter of leadership to task them in the right way. Mr. Gilman. How do you feel, Mr. Post? Dr. Post. Having an intelligence background, having sat in on many national intelligence meetings, I would think that something would be lost in having too much of a homogenization of functions. There is a utility to having different organizations, and often it would be a greater clarity emerges from the clash of ideas. Mr. Gilman. So I take it the consensus is you have some reservations about pursuing it. Dr. Alibek. Mr. Alibek. If I may, to clarify this idea. You know, I am dealing with many agencies. I talk to many experts from different agencies and departments. The problem is this. I didn't mean to--just to have an agency just to conduct this work. It's a completely different idea. The idea, because as I said before the problem of biological weapon threat and biological weapons defense is so comprehensive, is so complex, it's absolutely impossible to have a huge number of agencies or departments responsible for different pieces of this huge puzzle. And when we start collecting all these pieces of puzzle in sort of picture what we see now, we see a lot of duplication, I mean, just many agencies doing the same work. Many government contractors, they do absolutely the same projects. We see a huge number of absolutely the same efforts run by different agencies and departments. And, you know, when you start collecting you realize we have a lot of work under different leadership, under different agencies, same work. While at the same time you can see a lot of holes in this puzzle of biological weapon threat analysis and defense. Mr. Gilman. Dr. Alibek, let me interrupt you. Dr. Alibek, you were the head of an agency in the Soviet Union that concentrated all of the efforts on biological and chemical warfare in your agency, is that correct? Mr. Alibek. Yes, that's absolutely correct. Mr. Shays. Would the gentleman suspend a second? Does it also include defense as well as offensive? Mr. Alibek. It includes both offensive and defensive issues. Just my personal experience, I don't want a supercentralization, I would say, but you know when you've got an agency, it's not a superagency which is capable to do everything and to remove people and so on and so forth--but when you've got an agency which is controlling all situation-- the entire situation in this field, when it knows what kind of agency involved in what kind of work, what subcontractors are doing what kind of work--now, for example, I can say again you mentioned specific agencies. I see, for example, there is an entity, a large government contractor running the project who develop so-called encyclopedia of biological weapons. We might be in a senseless work. We spent millions of dollars to do this. But at the same time there is another agency running another project with similar tasks. Mr. Gilman. A lot of overlap. Mr. Alibek. Not just overlap. A lot of senseless work. A lot of overlap. In this case, of course, when we say about $ or $ million in this field, just if you start analyzing all this puzzle, you would see that percent of this money is overlapping each other. Mr. Gilman. In your agency in the Soviet Union you had over , workers all concentrating on biological and chemical warfare. Mr. Alibek. , workers, about facilities concentrated there both biological weapons research, biological weapon development, biological weapon production, biological weapons defense. Mr. Gilman. How long did that agency exist in the Soviet Union? Mr. Alibek. It existed from to . But now a similar agency exists under the Minister of Defense. It's similar agency but dealing with military issues of biological weapons and biological weapons defense. But it's a military agency. Mr. Gilman. Mr. Chairman, I hope that we can take another look at all of this since you were so forceful in your leadership on the fractionalization with other authorities with regard to terrorism and other aspects of chemical warfare. Let me ask the panelists, how do we force all of our agencies to share information? For example, you told us that there was a lack of sharing of intelligence between the FBI and the INS with regard to the hostage plane, that one of the hostage planes had taken place and had there been a sharing it could have been prevented. What are your thoughts? How do we improve the sharing of intelligence? Dr. Post. It seems to me, if I might note, that one of the better outcomes of this tragic event was cooperation on two levels which has been deficient in the past, both within the U.S. Government among agencies where there really is a significant press now to fully cooperate and share information and, at least as importantly, among the international community. One simply cannot assess this problem independently, either in any agency within the government or the United States alone without active sharing of information. And I think we are moving--there has been a kind of quantum leap as I have come to understand that cooperation. Mr. Gilman. Any mandates necessary domestically to do that? Should we have some mandate that there be forceful sharing of intelligence in---- Dr. Post. There are, of course, problems with the different perspectives of the agencies which will always be present-- having an informant versus having a witness, is this a crime or is this a developing information. Understanding--I have been regularly been struck at interagency meetings between Defense, CIA and FBI that one has three different perspectives coming to bear. Terrorism is crime. Terrorism is political action. Terrorism is a low-intensity conflict. But the issue you're drawing attention to is absolutely crucial, and any efforts that can be brought to improve that cooperation I think would be welcome. Mr. Gilman. Dr. Alibek, if reports are correct that the Soviet Union used the biological weapon Glanders against the Mujahadin in , what is the likelihood that terrorist groups from Afghanistan would use those kind of weapons against their adversaries? Mr. Alibek. Yes, you are absolutely right. There was credible information about the use of Glanders in against Mujahadins in some remote locations of Afghanistan. Glanders is a bacterial infection, very easy to grow, very easy to concentrate. If not treated, it has up to percent mortality rate. Very stable in aerosol and has some persistent forms. In this case, just when we talk about difficulties, in my opinion, it's not difficult. Likelihood I would say is high. Mr. Gilman. Glanders is a--they tell me that is a bacteria that's highly lethal, is that correct? Mr. Alibek. It's not highly lethal. I would call it incapacitating agent. If it stayed well we would have about a percent mortality rate. Without treatment, it would increase up to percent. Mr. Gilman. Has any---- Mr. Shays. If the gentleman--it has gone about or minutes. Mr. Gilman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Let me ask you, do you gentleman have until : ? Does anybody have a problem until : ? I'm going to quickly vote while Ms. Schakowsky--I'm going to let her recess. I'm going to let her recess in the meantime. I hope to be back shortly after we recess. Then we'll get right--started again. Is that all right? Ms. Schakowsky [presiding]. I just have a couple of questions. It seems to me as if Dr. Alibek says one of the goals of biological weapons is to incite panic and fear. In some degree that has already been accomplished, that there is an incredible preoccupation right now with biological terrorism and emphasized, I think, with the three cases of anthrax right now in Florida. But it has also focused attention on the public health infrastructure. And I apologize for being here. I have looked through the testimony, and I know you were talking about threat, but if you were to prioritize where we are now putting our emphasis in response, both to prepare against and to be ready should something happen, where would you put the priority of bolstering our public health infrastructure, the capacity to recognize a biological attack, to have the necessary vaccines, to have the communication systems that we need? We have heard about weaknesses on every level. In comparison, then, to the threat, how important is it to act now to address the public health infrastructure? Anyone can answer. Mr. Parachini. The value of your question is it points to opportunities for what I would call dual-use spending. There are things that we can do that improve our capabilities and our public health system to, for example, detect emerging infectious diseases that occur naturally that are not intentional. And as a by-product of that, we also include our capability to--the low probability of an intentional use of a biological agent. Ms. Schakowsky. So in comparison, though, for example, in terms of airline safety, other transportation modes, where would you put---- Mr. Parachini. Now you are broadening the spectrum beyond just within the biological area. Ms. Schakowsky. However you want to frame it. But how important is it? Mr. Parachini. Well, I would want to make investments that we get dual-use benefit across the board. Specialized investments just to address that terrorist problem or that terrorist problem today will be outdated tomorrow. And I am not fully in agreement that the only role of biological weapons is to inflict terror. And indeed, in , in the United States, the use of biological agents was not to terrorize, but was specifically to incapacitate people. Ms. Schakowsky. Oh, no. I'm just saying if that is one of the goals that--in part that has been achieved already. Mr. Parachini. If that is one of the goals, we would have to have somebody say that is what they intended to do, or we would have to get a defector, or we would have to have somebody on a witness stand say that. And while we think that, we actually have not had a terrorist or a defector talk about biological weapons for terror. We have them talk about them as effective killing weapons or effective incapacitating weapons. But when we are talking about biological weapons for terror, we are really projecting our fear into what we think they're thinking. It's not clear to me that's the case. Mr. Alibek. If I may, when the Soviet Union was developing biological weapons, the Soviet Union developed its own doctrine and classification of biological weapons. Biological weapons have been divided into so-called strategic biological weapons, operational biological weapons, and the major idea was to kill as many as possible people. Biological weapons, according to the Soviet Union's military doctrine, would be used to kill people. The United States' old--very old program existed in the 's and 's, intended to use incapacitating biological weapons. But what was important for the Soviet military strategists, everybody understood that in case of deploying biological weapons, one of the biggest problems would be in the country of deployment. It is huge panic, full distraction of any activity, vital military activity, because people actually, in addition to being infected, diseased and killed, they are afraid of biological weapons because they don't understand what it is. And it is one of the biggest problems. Another I think we are going to need to keep in mind, when we talk about biological weapons--and you know what worries me? When we discuss what kind of event we could see and whether or not we would see a sort of a small event like we saw several days ago in Florida, or it could result in some significant casualty number, the problem is this, and just what I would like to repeat once again: There is no single answer. We cannot say--we cannot insist saying biological weapons cannot produce a significant casualty effect. We cannot say at the same time-- we cannot say biological weapons are so effective that we could see a second doomsday, for example, and to produce sort of a doomsday scenario. In my opinion, what we need to do--that is why I said about our lack of understanding of the biological weapon threat. We need to understand it. Depending upon many different scenarios, agents, techniques, concentration of the agent, amount of the agent deployed and so on and so forth, we could see from dozens to hundreds of thousands of casualties. Ms. Schakowsky. I am going to have to go vote, and I am going to recess the committee right now. [Recess.] Mr. Shays [presiding]. Mr. Alibek thinks he has until : to get back. Sometimes wars get started by miscommunication, but we can deal with it on our own. Calling this hearing to order. You all have been informed of a CNN story that an employee of NBC in New York has tested positive for anthrax, and that was Friday. The FBI and CDC are investigating. Now, then, they got the story wrong, because they said the anthrax is not the same respiratory anthrax that killed a Florida man. The employee tested positive for cutaneous anthrax. In other words, it is still the same anthrax, it is just by skin rather than by air. What is your reaction, Dr. Post, concern? Dr. Post. Each time we hear one of these events, it regularly heightens our own suspiciousness, and there is a kind of hyperactive community now. But I must say that it is troubling, and I would like to learn more about that, but especially when it hits a news agency, what could that mean? Mr. Shays. They make a mistake if they take on the news industry; don't you think? Dr. Post. There is no limit to whom they will take on. Mr. Shays. Why don't I go to you, Mr. Parachini. What I was going to say to you, as I have said, based on the plus hearings we have had and the briefings we have had, I say the following: That it is not a question if there will be a chemical or biological attack, and it's a question of when, where and what magnitude. And I qualify the magnitude to be the less likely is the -year storm. Do you find that a statement you can agree with or disagree? Mr. Parachini. I agree with that. I think you are characterizing the scope and magnitude of the problem in the right way. Dr. Post. And motivationally, the issue of the -year storm for almost all terrorist groups would be highly counterproductive and have no positive incentive. Mr. Shays. Well, I used to think that before, but why now? I used to think that before, but not anymore. I mean, I don't see based on your comment about the red line---- Dr. Post. I said for almost all terrorist groups, the one exception being the Islamist radical extremists who see themselves as trying to strike a mortal blow at our structure. Having said that, they are doing quite well, thank you very much, on using conventional terrorism. And on their own--and I don't have access to classified intelligence on this matter. The technological, scientific resource matters that are necessary really would require cooperation of a state provision, such as Iraq, and that to me is a very important area to be zeroing in on human intelligence on the connections between Iraq and the bin Laden group. Mr. Shays. Do you have any comment on that? Is that an uncomfortable statement to have made? Mr. Decker. I don't think it is uncomfortable. With what we just experienced, I think it is accurate. Mr. Shays. Dr. Post, you had said weapons of mass destruction is not a helpful term because they can be used not as weapons of mass destruction, or they wouldn't most likely-- -- Dr. Post. The so-called weapons of mass destruction can be used in small attacks, and you can cause mass destruction with conventional terrorism. So I think it is semantically confusing. Mr. Shays. You don't see a distinction between a chemical, biological---- Dr. Post. That is CBRN terrorism, and it does have its own terrorizing aspects, the so-called silent death, but it is not useful--because it conjures up the spectacle of the superterrorism, and, in fact, the much more likely use would be a small local attack. Mr. Shays. I was born in , years old by . We then started to--we had the cold war--excuse me, the conventional World War I, II concept of confrontation gave way to the cold war, and there was a whole redefinition of how we responded. We ended up with--I am going to put a reward out for Dr. Alibek. And anybody gets him gets $ from me if you get him in the next minutes, and that is a promise you can bank on. But the cold war began. And we then--I am trying to think of, you know, is there some parallels to then and now. I had people tell me they thought cities would literally be blown up. I lived in a community in Fairfield County--Jason, you get $ . I want to get you on your way, but I just wanted to say and I am going to ask you, Dr. Alibek, this question. It can be a yes, if it is a yes or no. I just say that it is not a question if there is going to be a chemical or biological attack, but a question of not if, but when, where and of what magnitude, and the magnitude is the thing we talked about most likely to be small in nature, not large in nature. Is that an uncomfortable statement, a statement you would agree with or disagree? Mr. Alibek. I would answer this way now---- Mr. Shays. I want a yes or no first. Would you agree or disagree. If you don't agree, tell me. Mr. Alibek. I agree. Mr. Shays. Now qualify. Mr. Alibek. Of course, we will be seeing newer and newer cases of anthrax or some other infections. And we know, for example, today's case in New York, new information has come in about a new case of anthrax. But we will be going from small cases, and probably later we will be seeing a bigger number of cases of various infections. Mr. Shays. And all of the three of you agree with Dr. Post except as not surprising there is no red line anymore, no red line meaning no limit to what they would be willing to do. Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, there is no red line. Mr. Shays. You are not surprised by it? Mr. Parachini. Well, I guess I would want to texture that a little more, because I think that the motivations, for example, are more than just an audience of one and it being God. It is not just religion. There is a patina of religion here, but it's other things. They talk about political things. And indeed, bin Laden in his recent statement has done that, as did Ramzi Yousef on the stand in New York. Here's the part where I think it differs a little bit from there being no red lines. They see themselves as cosmic warriors engaged in a great struggle, and in order to continue that struggle which gives them meaning, they have to stay alive, or some of them have to stay alive. And so they are willing to do a lot, but it is not that there is no red line, it's that they're willing to do what it is to fight in this cosmic struggle. Mr. Shays. In fact, the red line is way off in the distance. Mr. Parachini. I don't think they think about a red line at all. And so by putting a red line out there, we are imposing how we think that they'd crash on through it. Mr. Shays. In a sense you said yes, and it's an interesting way of qualifying. You said you wanted to add texture to it. I'm learning every day from you guys. I know my colleague Mr. Platts wants to ask a question. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have two questions, and as a nonscientist kind of lay person on these issues trying to get a good understanding of the threats and the various aspects of these various biological weapons--the potential for it, earlier this week I sat in on a briefing with a doctor from John Hopkins and their civilian biodefense center, and when he talked about smallpox and the threats of that being used by terrorists and it spreading, one of the things he said was that a good nature--and the symptoms, I think, was days of very intense fevers followed by the onset of the rash, and that his statement to us was that a person is not contagious until the onset of the rash. And, Dr. Alibek, in your testimony, you talk about it being contagious before any symptoms are visible. And I'd be interested if you could expand it. Mr. Alibek. You know, it's one of the biggest disagreements between Dr. Henderson and myself. He considers smallpox becomes contagious when we see the onset of this infection. Unfortunately, we have seen many cases when monkeys became infectious on the last day of incubation period, and it was absolutely the same observation from the scientists who visited India and some other countries when they dealt with smallpox in those countries. This infection becomes contagious the day before the onset of these symptoms. Mr. Platts. That is based on your studies in Russia? Mr. Alibek. Based on all observations and based on new study. Mr. Platts. Well, I think that is an important aspect because of---- Mr. Alibek. This is the only contagious infection in which people become contagious before the onset of symptoms. Mr. Platts. OK. Thank you. From how to be able to address it, it emphasizes the importance of an immediate response as opposed to having a day or or days' kind of cushion to be able to respond. Mr. Alibek. You know, it is an interesting question, for example, when we analyze all scientific literature here in the United States regarding smallpox, you know what kind of information you find? You know, a very small general description of smallpox. Russia has studied smallpox for years from various aspects, especially keeping in mind that Russia, the Soviet Union, was involved in developing smallpox biological weapons for decades. In this case, a number of cases, a number of observations was much greater than here in the United States. And, you know, it is in many Russian sources. For example, if you analyze Russian sources, you can find this specific statement: Infection, this infection becomes contagious before the onset of symptoms. Mr. Platts. Thank you. Second question was for any of the panelist members who would like to address it is what other aspects of Dr. Henderson's testimony was the difficulty--and it has been reported in the press of it being very difficult to take a crop-dusting plane and adjust it to have such a fine mist that would be the serious threat. He contended in his statements to us that it is not true, that it would be very easy to kind of retrofit, to basically change some valves to make the crop- dusting plane very much a means of disbursing the biological element in a very effective way, and I had been interested in any opinions. Dr. Post. It is my understanding that one needs to make a distinction between an urban area and tall buildings, and in order to get the adequate concentration down, it would be quite problematic. I do want to raise what my initial reaction was to this just to add a totally different element. I found it very interesting that these inquiries occurred in a rather indiscrete fashion, in fact just before the event when they were going to give their lives. My initial question was, was this done, in fact, to create terror, knowing---- Mr. Platts. Psychological aspect of it? Dr. Post [continuing]. That they would be discovered, and was this part of a larger plan? I just raise this as an additional thought. Mr. Alibek. What is interesting, I agree with Dr. Henderson, when somebody says it is very difficult just to redevelop nozzles of crop dusters and just to have the right particle size, you know, in my opinion, it's incorrect. When we water the grass at our houses, there are some systems just to create mist. It is a very simple nozzle system. When we say it is very difficult to have biological agents in the right particle, it's a matter of just a specific nozzle device. And in this case, if this--usually crop dusters deploy biopesticides or pesticides--a regular particle size. Settling was in between , microns. When we talk about biological weapons deployment, this particle size must be between to microns. Some people say to . It's incorrect. Up to microns could work. It would cause different manifestations of infections. But microns work as well. And in this case, what I would like to say, one of the types of deployment in the Soviet Union for operation of biological weapons was to use medium-range bombers with spray tanks. In each spray tank, to capacity each, it had specially developed nozzles just to create this means. And, you know, crop dusters operate on the same principle. Mr. Platts. You are saying that you are agreeing with Dr. Henderson that it would be easily done? Mr. Alibek. He said it would be easy, and I agree it is not a technically unsolvable problem. Mr. Parachini. If I can just add, the Iraqis worked on this for a number of years and were not successful. We have to look into the future and hedge against that possibility, but let us keep in perspective the difficulty here. Mr. Alibek. We worked on this problem, and we used anthrax over the Virginia Islands using these medium-range bombers, and the effectiveness of this deployment was unbelievable. And in , deployment of tuleremia of--by American military showed with the right particle size was able to travel tens of miles and infect and kill monkeys , miles downwind. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, my thanks to all the panelists for their testimony. Mr. Shays. Dr. Decker, a housekeeping issue here. If we are trying to assess the threat assessment, part of that is do they have the capability, say, of delivering a chemical or biological agent. That would be part of the threat assessment, right? Mr. Decker. That's correct. Mr. Shays. Or a threat assessment, for instance, of radioactive material would be do they have radioactive material; or nuclear weapons, do they have a nuclear weapon? Mr. Decker. And other aspects of that, that's correct. Dr. Post. If I might add something worth noting in terms of threat assessment, one would like to know--and this is a human intelligence question--has this group been recruiting biochemists, or has it been recruiting inorganic chemists. Has it been trying to get into its cadre of specialists the kinds of scientists who could promote this. This would be one of the kinds of indicators one would look for that a group is making a transition from conventional terrorism to being really motivated to pursue bioterrorism. Mr. Shays. In a briefing we had yesterday, we had Eileen Pricer, who argues that we don't have the data we need because we don't take all the public data that is available and mix it with the security data. And just taking public data, using, you know, computer systems that are high-speed and able to digest, you know, literally floors' worth of material, she can take relationships that are seven times removed, seven units removed, and when she does that, she ends up with relationships to the bin Laden group where she sees the purchase of chemicals, the sending of students to universities. You wouldn't see it if you isolated it there, but if that unit is connected to that unit, which is connected to that unit, which is connected to that unit, you then see the relationship. So we don't know ultimately the authenticity of how she does it, but when she does it, she comes up with the kind of answer that you have just asked, which is a little unsettling. I just have a few areas of interest here, but I want to--my staff wants to make sure that I ask one question, and I am going to keep them on edge and wait to ask that question later. Makes them pay attention. Forty offices, , employees-- , employees would fill up a stadium. That is a lot of people. Mr. Alibek. Correct. Mr. Shays. They were all working on biological weapons and defensive ways to defend? Mr. Alibek. The great majority of them were working in two fields, biological weapons offensive issues and biological weapons defensive issues. Mr. Shays. And defensive, in your words, are what would happen---- Mr. Alibek. To development of treatment, of vaccines, and just to protect against biological infectious diseases. Mr. Shays. In the process of doing your work, were there occasions where people became inflicted with a particular disease and died? Mr. Alibek. Yes. We had some cases. Mr. Shays. You had casualties. Mr. Alibek. But you know what we were able to do because there were two major systems to develop biological weapons. Minister of Defense had a great number of people who died because they started this program in the 's and 's. Mr. Shays. When your unit was established after the Department of Defense, were you the civilian side of this? Mr. Alibek. We were a completely new entity, specifically established to develop modern, sophisticated biological weapons. Mr. Shays. This is a matter of public record, and I should know it, so I don't want to spend a lot of time, but it's going to get me to a question. Is this operation still going on? Mr. Alibek. The Minister of Defense is still having facilities, but this system, Biopreparat, has been dismantled. Mr. Shays. You have , people give or take. Mr. Alibek. Many of them have left Biopreparat facilities. And where these people are, it is very difficult to say. Mr. Shays. We are not talking about people, but , . Mr. Alibek. But at least people with sophisticated knowledge, a number is about , to , people. Mr. Shays. That is a staggering number. Mr. Alibek. Nobody knows where these people are. Mr. Shays. Now, in terms of the biological agents, did you come across some delivery systems that would be very helpful to the terrorists, or did you hit a wall where you just simply couldn't deliver a biological agent effectively? Mr. Alibek. No. Everything was developed. There are three major delivery systems for deployment because it was a military program. Mr. Shays. I don't need to know them. I just want to know if you did them. Mr. Alibek. We were able to develop very effective, sophisticated deployment techniques and means for deployment. Mr. Shays. Now, some--obviously, if they are military, the tip of a missile, that's one thing, but were some of them more subtle so they would be a means that would be a tool that a terrorist could use? Mr. Alibek. Some of them, at least percent of this technique, could be used by terrorists. Mr. Shays. Give me on a scale of to , being confident that terrorists have these weapons to that they don't. Where would you put it, being most likely that they had them, or at least the states--let's just go to the states, the Koreas, the Chinas, the Irans, the Iraqs, the Libyas. Mr. Alibek. Nine, ten. Mr. Shays. So, then, all I have to decide is if I think those countries have them, it's possible the terrorists have them. And I know what I think. Mr. Alibek. I'm talking about the countries. If you are talking about terrorist groups, it is difficult to say. Mr. Shays. We will all come to our conclusion. Dr. Post. On that question, might I note, though, the observation was made, terrorists are mobile and hard to trace where states are confined within their borders. The risk to a state of retaliation for it being discovered that it was providing these weapons to a terrorist group is certainly profound, and that will be a major--I am not saying it will stop providing them, but it certainly is a major disincentive for any state. Mr. Shays. The only problem with Afghanistan, for instance, if you believe the story yesterday, I mean, the Taliban and bin Laden are basically one and the same, if you accept that. This is--my major other area of questioning and I will get to the question the staff wants me to ask--well, let me do it now, the BWC, Biological Weapons Convention, did not stop the Soviet Union from developing biological weapons. The Soviets signed the BWC; is that correct? Mr. Alibek. That's correct. It was signed by the Soviet Union, but it didn't stop. It even expanded the Soviet Union's biological weapons program. Mr. Shays. And I don't believe, but I would be curious, do you think there is a way you can write a protocol to inspect all potential places where you would make a biological agent, or do you think that you could still have secret places that no one would ever know about? Mr. Alibek. In my opinion, it is impossible. Mr. Shays. Impossible? Mr. Alibek. Impossible, because these protocols would never be able to inspect all possible locations and all possible productionsites. Mr. Shays. And on a timely basis. Mr. Alibek. It is not just this issue. For example, the Soviet Union, as soon as that country started understanding that United States will be pressuring the Soviet Union severely, they started developing mobile installations for manufacturing and assembling biological weapons. Mr. Shays. Then let me just ask this question here. Do you think that the smallpox is still a Vector or--let me put it this way. This is what I have to sort out, and all of you can jump in. You basically had smallpox theoretically that was the WHO--that is the United States plus the Soviet Union--just those two and the WHO. But you have the United States theoretically and the Soviet Union have it, CDC and Vector. I don't know why other doctors who were dealing with the smallpox efforts to cure it, why they wouldn't have theoretically all abided by the request to destroy it. But my question to you is, are you totally and completely comfortable that smallpox is contained within Vector and nowhere else? Mr. Alibek. Absolutely not. I strongly believe that there are some countries who have secret stocks of this virus. And specifically we knew North Korea was experimenting with smallpox in late 's, early 's. And we knew that Iraq was experimenting with camelpox as a good surrogate for---- Mr. Shays. You said Iraq? Mr. Alibek. Camelpox is a good surrogate to model a smallpox infection. This is just what we know for sure. But in my opinion, there could be some other countries still having smallpox stocks. Mr. Shays. Which gets me to this question--and all of you could jump in as well in terms of your perspective on it--if I am asked, you know, by someone from the press or constituents what can they do--in other words, I know what the government can do to deal with the threat and the likelihood of a biological attack. I think I know what my government can do. I want my government to obviously have the proper threat assessment, to know the likelihood of when, where and what magnitude, and if we can determine that. I would like them to know potentially what kind of biological agent would be used, you know. And I guess that would be based on percentages, Mr. Decker, I mean, this more likely than that, but--is that a yes? Mr. Decker. I think there would be some attempt to quantify which one would be more probable, but that is problematic in itself. Mr. Shays. So then my question is, the best answer I have is that I want my government to have the antibiotics to deal with this and potentially the vaccines where a vaccine would be helpful. Like with anthrax it would be helpful even after someone has contracted the disease, with the antibiotics. But what else can the government do? Is it just prevention, or can we deal with it when it happens? Mr. Alibek. My position again, vaccines--I don't believe vaccines are good protection against bioterrorism. What the government needs to do is to liberate all possible protection and treatment approaches and just to start paying much attention to treatment, to medical treatment and to emergency prophylaxes. Not much has been done in this field. Mr. Shays. More on treatment than a prophylactic. Mr. Alibek. More on treatment and emergency prophylaxes. Mr. Shays. Is that based on your belief there can't be immunity from a biological attack? Mr. Alibek. Not just my belief, our experimental data suggests there are some directions, very promising directions, could be liberated and could result in appropriate protective means and approaches against biological weapons. Mr. Shays. I misunderstand you. I say a prophylactic. Can you vaccinate someone for all the potential biological agents? Mr. Alibek. When we say prophylaxes, there are two types of prophylaxes: first, vaccine prophylaxes and, second, urgent prophylaxes. It means---- Mr. Shays. When it happens---- Mr. Alibek. You can use it either immediately before or after exposure. There are different means and approaches to do this. In this case, keeping in mind that the number of agents being used in biological weapons is big--I would say large--it is very, very difficult to imagine that vaccines would have any volume in this case. But there are many scientific approaches and many scientific developments already. For example, you can talk to DARPA, and they can tell you about the immunological approaches they develop. In my opinion, there is a very good direction funded by DARPA. But there is another problem. Since we started developing vaccines here in this country and in many other countries, we lost a huge number of scientists who understand infectious diseases, infectious diseases per se, and, I mean, we have got a huge number of microbiologists, but we have no many scientists who can deal with infectious disease. Mr. Shays. In the United States and Europe? Mr. Alibek. Unfortunately, yes. We need to revise this issue, and we need to develop a new level of scientists, virologists, bacteriologists and experts in infectious diseases. Mr. Shays. I would like to have counsel ask a question. Mr. Halloran. Just in anthrax cases, the island--or not an island, but the island of Anthrax in the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan, what can you tell us about the anthrax that's there? What is the likelihood that it's still virulent; that if a terrorist from Afghanistan wanted to walk up there with a scoop and grab some anthrax, what's the likelihood that it's still virulent and would be useful to a terrorist? Mr. Alibek. You know, this island in Aral Sea--Russian name of this island was Virginia Island. It was the Soviet Union bioweapon proving testing ground. It has been used to test different biological weapons including the plague, tuberculosis Glanders and anthrax. The entire island is contaminated, completely contaminated. You can dig in and isolate spores of anthrax. They are still virulent, and they could be used if there is a group having access to this island. It wouldn't be a big problem to isolate virulent strains of anthrax from that island. Mr. Halloran. The island is not guarded? Mr. Alibek. You can come and have just a very simple protection, spray-type suits; just a simple protection, including gloves, masks and just having simple equipment just to take samples in petri dishes and just to see on the surfaces of petri dishes and then separate colonies, and you've got enough material just for growing. Mr. Halloran. And the expertise required to identify a lethal strain, is that undergraduate, postgraduate? Mr. Alibek. Undergraduate. I would say this: A level enough--in many cases it is not a matter, for example, of graduating or master's degree knowledge. It is a matter of commitment and specific desire, specific knowledge. You have a basic training in biology, but if you commit to a personal group, you will be able to retrieve this information from many sources available in the world. In this case, for example, if you know how to grow microorganisms and you know how to identify--because it is a simple process--with how to identify a virulent strain. People think in many cases it is necessary to infect animals, but if they know that virulent strains have capsule and they know how to grow, how take a sample or prepare a slide and just staining the slide and see a capsule, you know it is a virulent strain. Mr. Shays. Let me close by asking, is there any question you would like to ask yourself that you wished I had asked or some other Member asked? Seriously. Is there a question we should have asked? Mr. Parachini. I would just urge the committee at some point in its deliberations to think through the link between the state programs and terrorists, because at the moment there is no open source information to show that evidence. And indeed, the numbers about the number of people involved in former state programs who may be around the world are in a fair amount of dispute. We've heard very large numbers here, but there are many other views about what the number is and where those people are, most of whom are in Western countries, most of whom are in the United States. So that gauge, the threat requires a little more discussion. Mr. Shays. You don't want me to assume that if Iraq has chemical agents, that the terrorists who have worked in Iraq have them? Mr. Parachini. That's right. That would be one thing, and also the former Soviet agents or former Soviet scientists, given the size of all the number of people that worked in the program, only a much smaller number actually had weapons, critical knowledge, and many of them have come here and have not gone to North Korea, Iraq or Iran. So getting the dimension of the potential threat is an important thing to run at. Mr. Shays. Seems to me we can't do it until we have that. I make the assumption, admittedly based on all the hearings that we have had, that it is so likely as to be almost absurd not to think they haven't gotten them, but your point is, I haven't seen the money. But we have people who have made it very clear to us that pathetically that resources from the former Soviet Union to various countries went for a song, that they didn't pay a lot of money for some of what they got. And one of the things that concerns me--one of the things that has concerned me has been--I am sorry. I lost my train of thought, and I just want to get this point--that you have various republics where you had nuclear programs in countries other than now Russia. Do I make the assumption that all the chemical programs were in the Russia Federation, or were some of them in now what are independent states, independent countries? Mr. Alibek. Now, when we talk about, not chemical, biological weapons program, apart--this program was located actually in three former Soviet Union republics. The major part was in Russia. A small part was in Kazakhstan, and the third part was in Uzbekistan. Mr. Shays. That shouldn't make me feel good, should it? Mr. Alibek. Yeah. But when we say how many people knew, know, and where these people are, what I would like to say I know because---- Mr. Shays. Short answer. Mr. Alibek. I am having some Russian scientists working for me previously involved in Russian biological weapons program. They've got contacts with Russian scientists who visited Iran and Iraq and taught in Iran and Iraq, and they told these people who were in those countries, told that at least Iranian scientists had very sophisticated knowledge in molecular biology. They were there. Mr. Shays. I hear you loud and clear. Mr. Parachini. The link I am trying to make is between the terrorist group and the state. Mr. Shays. I think it is fair. Dr. Post. And just to add and echo this point, that is a huge, important intelligence target to be looking at that link, which we at this point in time scarcely have adequately covered. It is a human intelligence problem. Mr. Shays. Let me say to you I think this has been a wonderful panel, and I appreciate the moments when you were listening to others and then moments when you were the key player. If one of you wasn't here, this panel would not have been as helpful. It was the various contributions that you all made. And I hope our paths cross again. Very, very valuable information, and I appreciate it a lot. Thank you very much. This hearing is closed. [Whereupon, at p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] - "

(PART II) ---------- THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER , House of Representatives, subcommittee on Domestic Policy, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at : p.m., in room , Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dennis J. Kucinich (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Kucinich, Watson, and Towns. Staff present: Jaron R. Bourke, staff director; and Justin Baker, clerk/policy analyst. Mr. Kucinich. Good afternoon. The subcommittee will come to order. I want to note that usually we're joined by many Members of Congress, but late last night they had a get-out-of-dodge moment. And most Members are now back in their home constituency, a place that I intend to be in a few hours. But I am very pleased that all of you are here for this important hearing. The Subcommittee on Domestic Policy on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is now in order. Today's hearing is the second day of the first hearing held by Congress to examine the environmental impact of the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds in fields growing genetically engineered herbicide resistant crops. But for years, farmers have struggled with the impact. Across the Midwest and south, farmers growing Roundup Ready soy, corn and cotton have been encountering more and more kinds of weeds that Roundup herbicide cannot control. That weed resistance costs farmers money and causes them to resort to more and more toxic pesticides. Please look at the monitors for an excerpt from an ABC News segment that ran last year. Staff, play that segment. [Video shown.] Mr. Kucinich. Thank you. What responsibility for preventing and lessening the environmental impact of Roundup-resistant weeds and the consequent impact on farmers does the Federal Government have? Today we will hear from government regulators and others on that question. Now without objection, I'm going to continue with an opening statement of minutes, any Member or witness who wishes to submit a written statement or extraneous materials for the record will have legislative days to do so, without objection. And in our previous hearing in July, we heard from weed scientists that Roundup-resistant weeds have infested between and million acres of prime farmland in the southeast and Midwest. Mr. Chairman, welcome. This is the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Towns. Thank you for being here. While a phenomenon of natural selection for herbicide resistant--resistance is not new, the acceleration in a number of resistant weed species, and especially the infested acreage, is new. And it's been caused by the commercialization of multiple Roundup-resistant crop systems. In only the last decade, eight or nine species of weeds have rapidly evolved resistance to Roundup in herbicide resistant crop fields. Indeed, Roundup resistance in weeds has been known since the year when Roundup-resistant horseweed, a weed species that had not been previously resistant to Roundup, was discovered in Roundup-Ready crop fields in Delaware. While scientists have validated what farmers were discovering in their fields, the Nation's lead regulator of genetically engineered crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has been looking the other way. Every time a pesticide company petitioned the USDA to deregulate a new herbicide-tolerant variety of crop, USDA determined that the introduction of the new crop would have ``No significant impact'' on the farming environment. But recently the Department's indifference to the indirect consequences of their deregulation of Roundup-resistant crops has caught the attention of two Federal District Court judges. They independently struck down the USDA's deregulation of Roundup- Ready alfalfa, and Roundup-Ready sugar beets. They found USDA to have unreasonably and arbitrarily dismiss the environmental consequences of deregulating genetically engineered crops. In one instance, the judge found that USDA could produce no written record that it had ever considered the impact on farmers. Nevertheless, Roundup- resistant weeds are hurting farmers. They are imposing $ billion in additional weed control costs. They threaten cotton growing so profoundly that they've been compared to the boll weevil. And the solution may be worse than the problem. To combat Roundup-resistant weed proliferation, the pesticide industry recommends to farmers that they use more and more toxic pesticides on newly engineered crops that will be tolerant of those more toxic pesticides. That will surely lead to more environmental pollution, and, as we shall see, the collateral damage of crop destruction, and even more costs to farmers. In today's hearing, we will show that the USDA's passivity lies in stark contrast to the EPA's active approach in preventing pest resistance to genetically engineered crops it regulates. We will show that the USDA's legal authority is no less broad than EPA's legal authority. However, USDA views its broad authority much too narrowly, while EPA used its broad authority appropriately. Which approach has the better track record? Passive and self-constrained, USDA's approach has plainly allowed the proliferation of herbicide-resistant weeds. In contrast, EPA's record of prevention is a relative success. Perhaps we are at a crossroads for USDA's policy of passivity toward superweeds, having been reversed by two Federal judges with scores of farmers needing relief from the cost and consequences of superweeds. And with a new administration determining policy at the Department, it may finally be the time there for the Department of Agriculture to reexamine its approach to the deregulation of the genetically engineered crops, and to make a change in policy. It should be a change that would help prevent the proliferation of herbicide resistant weeds. It should be a change that would preserve efficacy of a relatively benign herbicide. It should be a change that would deescalate the trend to more and more toxic pesticides. It should be a change that would pass muster with Federal courts. It should be a change that would protect the long-term interest of farmers, consumers and the natural environment. The chair recognizes the distinguished chair of the full committee, Mr. Towns of New York. I appreciate your being here, Mr. Towns, and I appreciate the leadership that you provide on the full committee. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dennis J. Kucinich follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Towns. I want to thank you, first of all, for holding this hearing. I want to thank the witnesses for being here. And I know that you realize the importance of it because the Congress is not even in session, and of course this hearing is still taking place because of the importance of it. And of course, I want to just thank my colleague for moving forward with it because, let's face it, this is a very, very important hearing and I think that sometimes we forget all about it in terms of how important it is in terms of farming and something that we sort of pushed aside. I think it was Mr. Louis Perry, a cotton grower in Georgia whose family has been farming since , told a reporter that herbicide resistant pigweed posed a lethal threat to cotton farming in Georgia. I mean, it talks about in terms of how important it is, so if we don't whip this thing, it's going to be like the boll weevil as it was pointed out. Of course, we have to make certain that we stay on top of it and stay focused. I want to thank the gentleman who comes from an urban area that understands how important this is and spending time and focusing on it. So I want to let you know that from the full committee standpoint, we stand ready to support you in every way, but I'm happy to know that you're getting the message out, because it's important that we do so. So again, thank you for taking time to be here even when the House is not in session, because you felt it was important to continue without cancellation and I want to salute you for that. Thank you and I yield back. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much for being here, Mr. Chairman. I want you to know that--well, it's true that I'm in a primarily urban area. There are a few small farms in the southern part of my district. But I became aware of this, in part, through meeting with farmers across the country during the time that I was campaigning nationally for the Democratic nomination. So I have had the chance to actually be on farms, talk to farmers about their concerns about the issues that are raised in this hearing today. There are no additional opening statements, so our subcommittee is going to receive testimony from the witnesses before us today. I would like to start by introducing our panel. The Honorable Ann Wright, Deputy Under Secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Previously, she served as senior policy advisor to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, on Agriculture Committee matters. Before joining the staff of Senator Reid, she was a lobbyist for Consumer's Union on energy and trade issues. Previously she worked with farmers and nonprofit organizations at the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition in Washington, DC, and served as a policy advisor on agriculture issues for Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. Mr. Sid Abel, is the assistant deputy administrator for biotechnology regulatory service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. In this role, he helps provide oversight of risk-based introductions of regulated genetically engineered biotechnology crops, as well as conducting and providing oversight of broad environmental risk and impact assessments complaint with the National Environmental Policy Act. Prior to this, he served as the associate director with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Pesticide Programs. He worked for the EPA in various capacities from to . Mr. Abel will not deliver testimony, but will be available to answer subcommittee members' questions. The Honorable James J. Jones is the principal deputy assistant administrator of the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. He is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the office, which implements the Nation's pesticide toxic chemical and pollution prevention laws. The Office has an annual budget of over $ million, more than , employees. From to Mr. Jones served as a director of the office of pesticide programs. In this role he was responsible for the regulation of pesticides in the United States with a budget of approximately $ million and employees, making it the largest EPA headquarters program office. I want to thank each of the witnesses for appearing before the subcommittee. It is the policy of our Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to swear in all witnesses before they testify. Now Mr. Able, even though you're not making an opening statement, I'm going to ask if you would agree to be sworn because your answers to your questions will put your testimony on the record. And I would ask that all the witnesses rise. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Kucinich. Let the record reflect that each of the witnesses has answered in the affirmative. I ask that each witness give an oral summary of his or her testimony to keep the summary under minutes in duration. Your complete written statement is going to be included in the record. So what we want in minutes is to try to get a sense of what you want to communicate to this committee. I would like to begin with Ann Wright, the first witness on the panel, please begin. STATEMENTS OF ANN WRIGHT, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE; SID ABEL, ASSISTANT DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, BIOTECHNOLOGY REGULATORY SERVICE, ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE; AND JIM JONES, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF CHEMICAL SAFETY AND POLLUTION PREVENTION, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY STATEMENT OF ANN WRIGHT Ms. Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss USDA's biotechnology regulatory programs and the issue of herbicide- resistant weeds. First, I would like to emphasize that at USDA, we support all forms of agriculture, including conventional, genetically engineered and organic crops to meet the Nation's and world's needs for security, energy production and the economic sustainability of farms. All three of those methods of production must be strong and viable. As the world population increases, the demand for food is growing and the land available to farm is shrinking. We need innovative agriculture production systems to not only to maintain the competitiveness of the United States, but also to fulfill growing food needs. Biotechnology is just one tool to address those needs, but it's a critical one. USDA's role in regulating the products of biotechnology is carried out in coordination with EPA and FDA. Through the Plant Protection Act, our animal, plant health inspection service regulates those products that may pose a plant pest risk, while EPA and FDA use their authorities to address the safety of our food supply and the safe use of pesticides. USDA's biotechnology regulatory program, which has been in place since , is rigorous and science based. Since the program began we have effectively overseen nearly , field trials at , locations and deregulated over products. While our current biotechnology regulations have been effective in insuring the safe introduction of GE organisms, we are constantly learning from our experiences, reforming and refining our first rate program to protect American agriculture and the environment. As part of those refinements, we are always looking at ways to improve our program. Chief among these is our effort to update our biotechnology regulations. USDA is examining the policy issue raised in over , comments that were submitted on our proposed regulations, with the goal of better positioning the agency to address new challenges while meeting current needs. Our biotechnology program has evolved as the number of environmental issues to be considered under NEPA has grown as well as in response to several NEPA-related lawsuits. At the same time, it's important to remember that we have made thousands of regulatory decisions without legal challenge, and just as important, not one of our plant pest risk determinations have been overturned in court. You also asked me to discuss how USDA approaches herbicide- resistant weeds in relation to GE crops. A key point is that while the consideration of the herbicide resistance in weeds under NEPA informs our decisionmaking, and we are fully committed to meeting our NEPA obligations, USDA's biotechnology regulatory decisions are ultimately based on plant pest risk, consistent with our authority under the Plant Protection Act. It is also important to note that the development of herbicide resistance among weeds is natural and an evolutionary process. It is not exclusively associated with GE crops, and that GE crops provide many benefits, such as reduced pesticide use and decreased soil erosion thanks to no till farming. And we want to preserve those benefits. We must also be cognizant that if we limit the use of herbicide tolerant crops, farmers will likely have to return to older, less environmentally friendly weed control methods. Because herbicide resistance is an important issue for the agricultural community, USDA has multiple agencies engaged on the issue through research and education, as well as partnerships with outside groups and other Federal agencies. For instance, our National Institutes of Food and Agriculture's Competitive Grants Program provided $ . million in research for the biology of weedy invasive species. Further NIFA's extension outreach programs provide the connection between scientific research and its application on farms, the training sessions, field days and other outreach to growers. USDA's Agricultural Research Service has nearly $ . million in herbicide resistant weed research in fiscal year , which is part of $ million it's dedicating to all weed science issues this year. And APHIS is partnered with the EPA and the Weed Science Society of America to better understand the extent of herbicide resistance in managed ecosystems as well as the methods being used to manage herbicide resistance in weeds. We are fully committed to working with our partners to identify potential solutions and alternative techniques to address herbicide resistance. This will require a coordinated effort by everyone involved, the government, Congress, researchers, the agricultural community, technology and crop protection companies, and public interest groups. At USDA, we are looking at the broader context of herbicide resistance beyond just its relation to biotechnology. We look forward to working with our partners, including all in Congress. Together we are confident that we can find solutions that make sense. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, thank you again for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to answering your questions.

I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of transgenic B.t. crops, as well as EPA's involvement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and their assessments of the environmental impact of herbicide-tolerant crops and herbicide-resistant weeds. Under the coordinated framework for the regulation of biotechnology, EPA regulates products produced through biotechnology that are intended to have a pesticidal effect under its authorities under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. EPA first registered a transgenic B.t. crop in . Over the past years, B.t. crops have substantially reduced the need for growers to apply older, more risky conventional chemical pesticides to corn and cotton crops. Because sprayable B.t. formulations are naturally derived organic pesticides, they are very important to organic farmers. Given the importance of this technology to organic agricultural as well as the favorable environmental profile of B.t. as a pesticide, EPA has, from the very beginning of its regulation of transgenic B.t. crops, required registrants to market these products with specific mandatory insect-resistant management requirements. EPA would consider the development of insect resistance to B.t. toxins to constitute and adverse effect on the environment. These IRM requirements have evolved as the science has evolved, and we have altered and tailored the IRM requirements to match the latest and most relevant scientific data and information. The USDA regulates genetically engineered herbicide- tolerant crops, while EPA regulates the herbicides used on these crops. In order to coordinate our reviews in , the agencies developed a Memorandum of Understanding that outlined the Agency's respective roles. In , responding to increases in reported cases of resistance, EPA and USDA held discussions on the extent to which herbicide-resistant weeds were occurring in the herbicide-tolerant crops. As a result of these discussions, the EPA and USDA initiated a project with the Weed Science Society of America to develop a comprehensive manuscript to better understand the scope of herbicide resistance in genetically engineered, and non genetically engineered cropping systems. The report is due later this year. As glyphosate-resistant weeds have become more widespread in herbicide-tolerant crops, technology providers and users have become more open to efforts to address herbicide-resistant weeds. The support for resistance management from technology providers and users has spurred the development of strategies to prevent or manage herbicide-resistant weeds in herbicide- tolerant crops. EPA and USDA are working with researchers and professional societies to expand resistance management education and promote research aimed at increasing the understanding of the best practices and strategies for preventing and managing herbicide- tolerant weeds. EPA is also working with pesticide registrants encouraging them to include mechanism of action information on herbicide labels. This information is critical to the implementation of resistance management plans, which typically involve rotation of two herbicides with different mechanism of action as a proven strategy for preventing or delaying development of resistance. Recently, EPA and USDA have reinvigorated our efforts in this area to promote resistance management in herbicide- tolerant crops and preserve this valuable technology. We look forward to working with this committee, our fellow agencies, our stakeholders in the public, to ensure an environmentally and economically healthy country for all Americans. Thank you, and I'd be pleased to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Jones follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much. I would like to begin the first round of questions with Ms. Wright. As you know, the USDA, since they began deregulating Roundup-Ready Corn, Soy And cotton, among other genetically engineered herbicide-resistant crops in the late 's, weed scientists estimate that there are up to million acres of American farmland, and a dozen species of weeds that have evolved to be resistant to Roundup herbicide. The result for farmers has been greatly increased cost of weed management, and a probable loss of Roundup as an efficacious weed control chemical in large parts of the country. Is it the position of the USDA that it could not regulate genetically engineered herbicide-resistant crops in order to prevent this spread of herbicide-resistant weeds? Ms. Wright. Mr. Chairman, USDA recognizes the development of herbicide-resistant weeds across the board. Mr. Kucinich. What does that mean? Ms. Wright. It means that we recognize it as probably the No. issue for farmers and ranchers whether they are raising crops using biotechnology, or organic, or conventional seed. I think we have a number of ways that we're looking at this through our active and dedicated research programs that are looking at critical national priorities like the sustainable production of bioenergy climate change, global food security. We continue to see this issue as critical to farmers bottom lines. And right now, we have confidence in a science-based process that regulates in and around our plant protection authorities, our statutory commitments are to that act. Mr. Kucinich. Well, you know, that's very interesting, but the question that I asked is, is it your position that the USDA could not regulate genetically engineered herbicide-resistant crops in order to prevent the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds? Ms. Wright. That's correct. Our statutory authority allows us to make regulatory decisions based on plant pest risk. Mr. Kucinich. Tell me more about that. Ms. Wright. Well, what I can tell you is that the plant pest risk is determined by--well, I'm going to let---- Mr. Kucinich. Let me go to Mr. Jones a minute. Mr. Jones, the EPA has taken a different position. EPA believed that it could regulate one genetically engineered plant variety in particular, those containing the B.t. or the Bacillus thuringiensis gene in order to prevent the development of pest resistance to B.t.; is that correct? Mr. Jones. That's correct. We're operating under a different statute, in this case, FIFRA. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Jones, I understand the EPA's been regulating B.t. crops to prevent pest resistance for about years. Is there a problem with B.t. resistance in this country comparable to the problem of Roundup resistance in weeds? Mr. Jones. There is not. Mr. Kucinich. Pardon? Mr. Jones. No, there is not. Mr. Kucinich. Are there million acres of B.t. resistant farmland right now? Mr. Jones. We're not aware of resistance yet---- Mr. Kucinich. How many acres of American farmland has been infested with B.t. resistant pests? Mr. Jones. We're not aware of any. It doesn't mean there isn't some. Mr. Kucinich. Well, is B.t. still an efficacious pesticide in the United States? Mr. Jones. It is. Mr. Kucinich. Does it concern EPA to learn that weed resistance to Roundup is now widely prevalent? Mr. Jones. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. If so, why? Mr. Jones. Glyphosate to Roundup is--has a very favorable, as you mentioned in your opening remarks, environmental profile. And so it's a compound that we think it's in the interests of the environment to have a long commercial life. Mr. Kucinich. So your saying that it's because the glyphosate is relatively benign? Mr. Jones. It has a very favorable environmental profile. Mr. Kucinich. Ms. Wright, million acres of infested farmland, $ billion in added weed control costs to farmers. The loss of efficacy for a relatively benign pesticide in many places, these are some of the consequences of the USDA's position that it could not regulate Roundup Ready crops to prevent the evolution of resistant weeds. Now, Ms. Wright, you say in your written testimony, ``There must be a plant pest risk to deny a full deregulation. An herbicide resistance does not constitute a plant pest risk.'' Now I'm questioning your legal interpretation as to whether it's well-founded. Your position is that the sum total of the USDA's authority derives from section of the Plant Protection Act which gives the Secretary authority to prevent the introduction of plant pests. But that is not the sum total. The very next section of the act, section , covers your authority to prevent the spread of, ``Noxious weeds.'' Section ``gives the Secretary authority to prohibit or restrict . . . the movement . . . of any plant . . . if the Secretary determines that the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent . . . the dissemination of a . . . noxious weed within the United States,'' from the statute. Now ``noxious weeds'' are defined by the statute at U.S.C. section as, ``Any plant or plant product that can directly or indirectly injure or cause damage to crops or . . . other interests of agriculture . . . or the environment.'' Ms. Wright, a plain reading of section gives the Secretary the broad authority to restrict the use of Roundup- resistant crops if sound science determines that those restrictions are necessary to prevent the spread of Roundup- resistant noxious weeds. How can you come to Congress and insist that effectively that section doesn't even exist? Ms. Wright. Well, first let me say that this USDA is very committed to looking at all of our programs and policies, and ensuring that they are there for all forms of agriculture---- Mr. Kucinich. I know you're not--this is your first time before a committee. Ms. Wright. It is. Mr. Kucinich. And I do appreciate your being here. I asked you a question, and I would like an answer. That was not responsive. Ms. Wright. We interpret our existing authorities as those focused on plant pest risk. Back in March , we issued a set of updates to our rules and regulations that expanded our authorities into the Noxious Weed Act. We're now looking at , comments on those rule updates. This is a new administration, we will be taking a close look at the full range of comments that came in and be looking very carefully at where our authorities are. Mr. Kucinich. Are you familiar with section of the act? Ms. Wright. No, sir. Mr. Kucinich. You're really not? Before the end of this hearing, I would like staff to have a copy made of section of the act and provide it to the witness, because if the regulatory agency is not fully familiar with the extent of its authority, it may be one of the difficulties we're having here. Ms. Wright. I think the Agency is probably very familiar, but I personally am not, and I'm sorry. Mr. Kucinich. Well, I can understand that it is a new administration, and that you're new, and you do have a very good reputation where you come from. But I think it's important that you become familiarized with the act and with the sections that I articulate, particularly section , which actually does change the role of your agency and your office to effectively regulate herbicide-resistant weeds. If you--I'll take you at your word that you're not familiar with it. But what I glean from that, since you are not familiar with it, you can't point to any provision of the Plant Protection Act that would deny the USDA the ability to use the authority of the section to prevent the spread of Roundup-resistant weeds. I think it's clear from your testimony that the USDA's position is not too much a legal judgment as is a statement of policy. And that it's been the policy of the USDA not to use the authority that it does have under section , it's just very clear. I just want to make this statement to you as the chairman of this oversight subcommittee that a plain reading of section makes it obvious that if the Agency wants to become involved in the enforcement of herbicide-resistant weeds, that it could do it, that you do have the statutory authority to do it, and that it's a policy question. Now you may not be the person who makes the final call on that, but somebody all the way up to--the ladder at Agriculture is making that call, and this subcommittee's determined to see the statute enforced. Now, Ms. Wright I know that the Department understands at this point, that the problem of superweeds is a crisis. What I don't understand, and what defies comprehension is this: That the Department does have the legal ability to help farmers deal with the crisis, and to prevent it from worsening, and that the USDA has not made a policy, a decision to use this authority or has made a policy decision not to use it. Do you have anything further that you can tell this subcommittee? You will read the statute? Ms. Wright. Thank you. Yes, I promise to fully read the statute and I would like to say--and thank you for the opportunity to address this problem and to address the entire issue of coexistence. We're going to have to have a full slate of partners at the table looking at this, including Congress, as well as technical service providers, other Federal agencies, regulated entities and public interest groups. And together, I think, we will be able to solve this problem, including growers, it's not one that--as well as the markets, it's not one that exclusively rests on our shoulders. Mr. Kucinich. Ms. Wright, I want to draw attention to the Department's view that it currently has authority to regulate future planting of GE crops through administrative action. The Department outlined three such actions in a court filing from July of this year. I move to insert into the record the fourth declaration of the APHIS administrator Cindy Smith. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Kucinich. My question, Ms. Wright, is this: Is it also the Department's view that it could, by means of any of those administrative actions, place requirements on a permitted planning of GE herbicide-tolerant crops to prevent the proliferation of herbicide-resistant weeds. Ms. Wright. In both the case of GE alfalfa as well as GE sugar beets there are currently formal petitions before the agency for us to look at ways to partially deregulate these. Mr. Kucinich. So that's a yes? Ms. Wright. We're in the process of looking at that. Mr. Kucinich. So that's a yes? Ms. Wright. So the industry has come to us and asked us to look at that options. Mr. Kucinich. So is this consistent with the testimony that has been given in court? Ms. Wright. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. You found expansive authority to devise three administrative actions allowing to you approve large scale planting under a permit system. What is the basis? Do you have---- Ms. Wright. No, sir. The industry came to us and asked us to look at partial deregulation as one way to allow the planting of a GE crop. Mr. Kucinich. Are you talking about the cases that were struck down by Federal district courts? Ms. Wright. Yes, sir. Mr. Kucinich. That was at the request of the industry, right? Ms. Wright. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. OK. What's the--I'm still trying to figure out the basis for your view here today that a permit system which the GE crop would remain a regulated article and nevertheless not permit to you to place requirement on planting and preventing the spread of Roundup resistance in weeds. Ms. Wright. Unless we determined there a plant pest risk, we do not have it that expansive authority. Mr. Kucinich. So you're still stuck on one section of the act and haven't read the other. Ms. Wright, isn't it true that the Department has had under development, a new biotechnology rule and that the rule was also under development during the previous administration? Ms. Wright. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. OK. And with the change in administration, can this Congress expect to see any differences in the Department's approach to herbicide-resistant weeds and the rule you're now working on. Ms. Wright. I can tell you that we're having internal discussions about our policies, and around coexistence, and that we just honestly cannot afford to look at options and alternatives that are not supportive of various cropping systems, including biotechnology, organic and conventional. They all play a very critical role in the health of our rural economy and in our agricultural economy. Mr. Kucinich. I know that was in your opening statement. I heard that. But it's not responsive to the question I asked. Ms. Wright. Can you ask your question again? Will you please restate your question? Mr. Kucinich. There has been a change in administrations, can we expect to see any difference in the Department's approach to herbicide-resistant weeds in the rule that you're now working on? Ms. Wright. I think we're looking at all--a lot of options, and we're going back and looking, considering the comments that were submitted. We're internally having discussions across the Department. We have a Secretary and an administration that's very committed to the idea of addressing the issues of coexistence, and that's as much as I can say today. Mr. Kucinich. See the thing that I'm concerned about--and I am really trying to give you the benefit of the doubt on what you're saying, the thing that I'm concerned about, is that when you go back to your talking points, you actually inadvertently shut the door on consideration of the science and experience that's been brought forward through the EPA's enforcement through the practical experience of farmers, through the NRC report. And so I'm trying to--because it's important that we understand--you've made it clear that the policy, you know, what the policy is, you haven't extended that to a legal interpretation, but if you're just saying well, you know, we have different ways of supporting agriculture, we're going to try to support them all. But if you rest on that and don't go deeply into expressing to this subcommittee a concern that the extent to which herbicide-resistant weeds may represent an attack on the rights of farmers, the economic rights of farmers, the environment, if you don't articulate that, it causes me to pause. Ms. Wright. Well--out of all due respect, I would say that it's not that we don't recognize this as a bottom line issue for farmers and ranchers---- Mr. Kucinich. It's what? Ms. Wright. It's not that we don't recognize this as a critical issue for farmers and ranchers, but I think this administration and USDA see biotechnology as being a very important tool for farmers to use in addressing some very critical issues, globally and here domestically. And all of the options that we look at have to be supportive of that, they have to encourage and support innovation in a smart way. Mr. Kucinich. Do they look the other way if there is a problem? Ms. Wright. No, I don't think so. We take our NEPA process and documents very seriously. In fact, the Secretary just approved a reorganization of our BRS services, we have a whole team, a new team, a whole program dedicated to NEPA now. We have a budget increase request before Congress for , fiscal year of $ . million to hire new scientists. We take these issues very seriously. And as we learn more about the environmental impacts of this technology, we try to adjust and we try to make our rules and regulations. Mr. Kucinich. Just out of curiosity, you think--genetic-- you just talked about the importance of biotechnology, is it your view, personally, that genetically engineered crops are the functional equivalent of conventional crops? Ms. Wright. Well, I'm not prepared to reflect on that. Mr. Kucinich. OK, that's fine. For the last couple of decades, the EPA and the USDA had pledged in various Memoranda of Understanding to promote integrated pest management. One of the key objectives of integrated pest management is preserving the efficacy of relatively benign pesticides and preventing herbicide resistance in weeds. Now I move to insert into the record one such Memorandum of Understanding from . Now, to the EPA, I want to address this question, does it concern the EPA from the perspective of integrated pest management that more and more acres of farmland are showing signs of infestation by Roundup-resistant weeds? Mr. Jones. Yes, it does. Mr. Kucinich. Now, in general, isn't proliferation of Roundup-resistant weeds across millions of acres of farmland a setback for integrated pest management? Mr. Jones. Sure. Mr. Kucinich. And to the USDA, does the USDA agree with the EPA that from the perspective of integrated pest management to widespread infestation of Roundup-resistant weeds constitutes a setback? Ms. Wright. I'm sorry, can you please repeat that? Mr. Kucinich. Does the USDA agree with the EPA, which just responded yes, that the proliferation of Roundup-resistant weeds across millions of acres of farmland is a setback for integrated pest management. I asked you, do you agree with the EPA from the perspective of integrated pest management, the widespread infestation of Roundup resistance weeds constitutes a setback? Ms. Wright. Possibly, yes. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Jones, in communication with the majority staff, the EPA has stated that the USDA did solicit EPA's input in its Environmental Impact Statement for Roundup Ready Alfalfa, but as we've already seen, the Environmental Impact Statement will not consider any measures for preventing the spread of Roundup-resistant weeds. USDA testified that EPA raised no objection to their draft environmental impact strategy on alfalfa, which USDA characterizes as meaning, ``The EPA had no concerns.'' Is that a complete representation of EPA's comments to USDA on the Roundup-Ready Alfalfa Environmental Impact Statement? Mr. Jones. Chairman, to be fair to my colleagues at USDA-- -- Mr. Kucinich. I'm asking you to answer the question, not to be fair, but to answer the question. Mr. Jones. The answer to the question is that an Agency's formal response that went through our office of Federal activities, we did not raise the issue of insects--I'm sorry, herbicide resistance. In informal conversations, when we've had a number of them, and they continue to this day. Mr. Kucinich. So you did raise a concern about weed resistance management; is that right? Mr. Jones. That's correct. Mr. Kucinich. Now Ms. Wright, this is somewhat at a variance with your written testimony. And contrary to that, does the USDA now acknowledge that the EPA did, in fact, express concern about the weed resistance management issue in the alfalfa Environmental Impact Statement? Ms. Wright. Yes, we did. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Jones, did USDA ever ask EPA to offer its expertise in preventing pest resistance in the context of the USDA's preparation of an environmental impact statement for deregulating GE alfalfa? Mr. Jones. Once we raise the concerns that we have identified through informal mechanisms that led to an ongoing dialog between USDA and EPA to address those, and so---- Mr. Kucinich. Did they ask you to offer your expertise? Mr. Jones. That is correct. Mr. Kucinich. What did they ask you to do? Mr. Jones. When we raised our--we raised some issues associated with resistance management, and as it was characterized in EIS. And the Department said to us, you've raised some very good points, let's talk about that, we want to understand this better. And those conversations continue, as I said, to this day, and I believe will continue until we feel like we're on the same page on that issue. Mr. Kucinich. Well, given the scientific verification of the rapid spread of Roundup-resistant weeds, do you think it might be justifiable for the EPA and the USDA to revisit the question in preparation for the final environmental impact statement for Roundup Ready Alfalfa, Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones. I believe that's what we're doing right now. Mr. Kucinich. And to Ms. Wright, given the EPA's successful effort thus far in preventing the Bacillus thuringiensis resistance in pests, wouldn't it make sense for the USDA to want to utilize the EPA's expertise to help regulatory means to prevent and mitigate Roundup resistance in weeds? Ms. Wright. Yes. And if it's OK with you, I'd like to ask Sid Abel to address more of the specifics around how we are working with EPA. Mr. Kucinich. He's sworn, he can do that. Mr. Abel. We are--right now we're working very directly at the staff level with our partners at the EPA to address specifically the issue of glyphosate tolerance among weeds. We agree, both with EPA and with other parts of our Federal partners, that this is a serious issue for farmers. It's also a serious issue for the technology. We see that this is a very favorable compound to be used in controlling weeds, and to preserve that technology is very important to us. So we've entered into these discussions with EPA at the staff level with the Weed Science Society of America, and with others, universities and extension agents to get a better handle on the extent to which glyphosate tolerance is occurring out there, not just in GE crops, but also in conventional crops. We believe that by going through this process, we'll be able to put forward some strategies for managing these crops in a way to preserve these technologies into the future. Mr. Kucinich. Have you read section of the act? Mr. Abel. It has been a while, but yes, sir, I have. Mr. Kucinich. Would you read it again? Mr. Abel. Yes, I would. Mr. Kucinich. I want to thank the members of this panel for participating in this important discussion. And this committee will continue to retain jurisdiction over this matter, which means that there will be more hearings. We are very interested in the policies of the USDA as it affects the environment, farmers. And I'm grateful for your presence here today and for the EPA's continuing work in this area as well. The first panel is dismissed and I'm going to call the second panel to come forward, and we will begin the second panel in a couple of minutes as soon as you're all in place. I am going to read the introductions at this moment while staff is getting set up. I want to welcome to this subcommittee Congresswoman Diane Watson, Ambassador Watson from California, for gracing this hearing. We have here today Mr. Steve Smith. Mr. Smith, welcome. Mr. Smith is director of agriculture at Red Gold, Inc., the largest privately-held canned tomato processor in the country.

We are going to begin with Mr. Smith. You are the first witness. I would ask you to proceed. STATEMENTS OF STEVE SMITH, DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, RED GOLD TOMATO; PHIL MILLER, VICE PRESIDENT, GLOBAL REGULATORY, MONSANTO CO.; BILL FREESE, SCIENCE ADVISOR, CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY; AND JAY VROOM, CEO, CROPLIFE AMERICA STATEMENT OF STEVE SMITH Mr. Smith. Thank you, Chairman Kucinich, and members of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee. I thank you for the opportunity to present to you some important concerns about the pending release of dicamba-resistant soybeans. My name is Steve Smith, director of agriculture for Red Gold, the largest privately-held canned tomato processor in the United States. Red Gold is based in Indiana and has three processing facilities. Our tomatoes are grown by family farming operations in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. Our concerns about the upcoming increased use of dicamba are not just about tomatoes but all fruit and vegetable crops and rural homeowners living near local farms. The use of dicamba is not new. It is effective, it is a great weed killer, and it is economical to apply. So many may be wondering why a product that is effective, proven, and economical is not the No. herbicide in use today. The answer is simple: dicamba has also proven itself to move off target and injure adjoining crops, so it is not currently widely used. New technology is good and needs to be pursued, but must be examined for unintended consequences. At one time the conventional wisdom thought it was a good idea to use lead in paint. The theory of dicamba-tolerant soybeans might appear sound on the surface--the ability to kill weeds is proven--but the potential damage to other sectors of agriculture and rural homeowners demands that we take a closer look at this particular advance. When put in the spotlight, the answer will become abundantly clear: The widespread use of dicamba is incompatible with Midwestern agriculture. dicamba is highly vulnerable to offsite movement in three forms: direct drift, volatilization, and spray-tank contamination. You would think that the risk of direct drift could be completely controlled by good management practices such as spraying in little or no wind or when the wind was blowing away from sensitive crops such as tomatoes. But unfortunately, that is not always the case. Red Gold has suffered over $ million in drift claims over the last years. A reduced application window has forced otherwise good farmers to spray on windy days when they know they shouldn't. But I want to focus on volatilization because it is the real issue that makes dicamba a danger to Midwestern agriculture. Volatilization occurs when the active ingredient evaporates and then can be moved with the surrounding air mass for up to days after application; and its killing capabilities can spread up to miles or more in certain geographic areas such as in a valley. Even the best farmer, the most conscientious farmers can't control or predict what will happen for up to days after application. Ironically, the very conditions that minimize direct drift actually maximize volatilization: little or no wind, high temperatures, and high humidity--normal conditions for when this product is applied in June and July. A good neighbor that awakens early in the morning to spray before the winds pick up would be at the highest risk of causing volatilization injury. In other testimony offered, we learn that new formulations of dicamba will reduce the risk of volatilization. We believe those claims to be overly optimistic as even the newest formulations are still proven to move off target. It simply is impossible to control or predict its movement. The science is clear and settled in regard to dicamba's susceptibility to off- target movement due to volatilility. If, as you might hear from others, the risks of off-target movement of dicamba due to volatilization are low and can be controlled through improved product stewardship and formulations, it only makes sense that those who will profit from the sale of this seed technology and the makers of dicamba should willingly step up to the plate and establish an indemnity fund to cover crop losses and homeowners' claims for damages. If they are unwilling to cover potential losses, is this an admission that the safety of this technology is not as safe as we have been led to believe? The Midwest is the home to a unique system of family farms that are known as the bread basket of the world. The introduction of dicamba-tolerant soybeans is a classic case of shortsighted enthusiasm over a new technology, putting this region at unneeded risk, and blinding us to the reality of damage that is sure to come. Even the best, the most conscientious farmers cannot control where this weed killer will end up. Increased dicamba usage made possible through the introduction of dicamba- tolerant soybeans is poor public policy and should not be allowed. Thank you for the opportunity to present my concerns to you today. I will be happy to answer any questions you might have concerning this topic. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you, Mr. Smith.

Chairman Kucinich and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify on matters relating to modern agricultural technology. I work at Monsanto whose only focus is agriculture. I spent much of my youth in a small agricultural community in Lawrence County, Illinois, where I had the privilege of helping my grandfather on his farm. I also have a farm in Nebraska. Through my experiences, I have a great appreciation for what the American farmer has and can achieve with the right tools and a willingness to adopt new technologies and practices. I currently serve as vice president of regulatory, with more than scientists in my organization, and it is responsible for the global product approval and stewardship. The topic of today's hearing is an important one. The world population is growing. In the next years or so, there will be billion people on our planet. That is billion more people that will show up to the dinner table, and many will want to use the foods we have grown up with. To put it in context, that is the equivalent of three more Chinas. The challenge is: How do we do it using fewer resources? Farmers are increasingly being asked to produce more with less, and helping to do this is what Monsanto is all about. Our company has a commitment to sustainable agriculture. We will do our part to help farmers double yield in the core crops of corn, cotton, and soybeans between and , while producing each bushel or bale with one-third fewer resources. Just as important, in doing so we will help farmers earn more, and improve the lives of their families and rural communities globally. Agricultural innovation has provided farmers with improved agronomic practices, advances in breeding, and novel traits through modern biotechnology, which increases yield and profits. In , the Roundup Ready system was first introduced into soybeans. The Roundup Ready system was attractive to farmers because it offered superior crop safety and the use of a familiar and proven herbicide that controls more than weeds. In Roundup Ready Soybeans, glyphosate sprayed after the crop's weeds emerge provide a level of weed control and ease of use that surpasses other options. Importantly, in addition to the benefits provided in weed control, the Roundup Ready system has made the adoption of conservation tillage practices feasible. Conservation tillage contributes to the long-term sustainability of farming practices. Before the Roundup Ready system was introduced, the environmental benefits of conservation tillage were documented, but adoption by growers had been limited. The broad enrollment in conservation tillage due to the Roundup Ready system has led to the reduction and extensive plowing and tillage which has significantly reduced the loss of topsoil due to erosion, improved soil structure, reduced runoff of sediment and fertilizer, reduced on-farm fuel use, reduced CO emissions, and increased carbon sequestration in the soil. Controlling weeds is paramount in maintaining and improving crop productivity. Unlike insects and diseases which occur in some years and not others, weeds occur in crops every year. Experts recommend using multiple herbicides to provide more than one mechanism of action. Applying multiple mechanisms of action reduces the likelihood of a resistant weed population developing because there is a low probability that a particular weed within a population would have resistance to both mechanisms of action. In addition, farmers may choose to use mechanical or cultural techniques in addition to or in place of herbicides. The specific program employed would depend on the farmer's choice and the best management practices on his or her farm. Monsanto has shared interest with farmers in effective weed management. The proactive adoption of best management practices based on the principle of diversity in weed management will improve weed control, help ensure that conservation tillage systems are sustainable, and that the yield, economic, and environmental benefits are fully realized. As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, Monsanto's only focus is agriculture. If farmers don't succeed, Monsanto doesn't succeed. That is why as we bring new technology to the market, we value growers' input, such as Mr. Smith who is here today, who we have invited and has become a member of our dicamba advisory council. We are committed to invest and develop seed and trait systems to provide farmers with effective, affordable, convenient and sustainable agricultural solutions, including weed control. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your time and attention today. I look forward to answering your questions. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you for your testimony. [The prepared statement of Mr. Miller follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Freese. STATEMENT OF BILL FREESE Mr. Freese. Yes. Chairman Kucinich and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today to testify. I would just like to preference my remarks quickly to respond to something Ms. Wright and Mr. Miller just said about world hunger and productivity. Actually, the subject here, Roundup Ready crops, do not have higher yields. That is a myth. It is basically designed to save time and save labor and help farmers get bigger. Also, there is an increase in pesticide use with these crops, actually quite substantial, not a decrease. And the conservation tillage benefits that Mr. Miller mentioned, conservation tillage was mostly adopted before the introduction of these Roundup Ready crops. Just as Roundup Ready crops were being introduced in , Monsanto scientists published a paper in which they presented all of the reasons weeds were not likely to evolve resistance to glyphosate. It is not the first time they have been wrong, and they turned out to be disastrously wrong. As discussed in part of this hearing in July, unregulated use of these crop systems has triggered an epidemic of glyphosate-resistant weeds, and it fostered sharp increases in herbicide use, greater use of soil-eroding tillage operations, and is substantially raising weed control costs for ever-more growers. Now Monsanto and other pesticide firms assure us that multiple herbicide-resistant weeds are the solution to glyphosate-resistant weeds. Dupont, for instance, even envisions a single crop resistant to seven or more different classes of herbicides. There are hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in resistance genes to just about every herbicide imaginable, including paraquat, for instance, and about half of the GE crops pending deregulation at USDA right now are herbicide- resistant. We shouldn't let ourselves be misled again. These new herbicide-resistant crops are the wrong response to glyphosate- resistant weeds. Just very briefly, and I can go into detail in questions if you would like, but one reason is that they simply won't work. At best we will get a short-term reprieve until nature cleverly evolves resistance to the new and multiple herbicides deployed against them. Second, farmers will pay in multiple ways through increasingly expensive biotech seeds and the multiple herbicide cocktails that come with them, and through crop damage, as Steve mentioned, or through purchasing the HR seed in order to defend oneself against drift. Third, both public health and the environment will suffer from a substantially increased use of toxic herbicides such as , -D and dicamba. Finally, this new wave of crops diverts attention from truly sustainable weed control practices, which I would like to get to in a moment. I think it is very clear that the glyphosate-resistant weed epidemic is a symptom of regulatory breakdown. We have USDA which regulates an herbicide-resistant crop, and the EPA the herbicide; but no one regulates the combination, the herbicide- resistant crop, the herbicide system. And it is the system, the continual use of a herbicide, glyphosate on Roundup Ready crops, that is responsible for the growing epidemic of resistant weeds. This system has been presented to farmers as self-contained, two component, seed and Roundup, and that is the way it has been used. I am tired of people blaming farmers for this. When a Federal district court judge reversed APHIS's deregulation of Roundup Ready alfalfa, he underscored APHIS's failure to examine glyphosate use. APHIS now gives purely pro forma attention to herbicide use in their regulatory reviews, and even this minimal treatment is grossly inadequate. APHIS, for instance, dismissed analysis of herbicide use of Roundup Ready crops in the Roundup Ready draft and Environmental Impact Statement that relied on gold-standard data from its sister agency, the National Agricultural Statistic Service, and in its place it used bogus data from simulations conducted by pesticide industry-funded groups, like the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy and PG Economics. In other cases, USDA cited completely irrelevant data that was years old or more, no relevance. APHIS also ignored research by scientists from USDA's Agricultural Research Service and others that point to potentially increased disease susceptibility in Roundup-treated, Roundup Ready crops. And, unfortunately, USDA does not require testing of Roundup Ready crops to which Roundup has been applied, which is the invariable practice of farmers. In view of the growing evidence of disease, possible disease susceptibility issues, that is inexcusable. I would just like to say USDA should definitely follow the lead of the EPA. The successful insect resistant management program could be followed by USDA. And I don't buy Ms. Wright's protestations that USDA doesn't have authority. The noxious weed provisions of the Plant Protection Action clearly gives them authority to regulate practices that foster noxious weeds, and that is exactly what these Roundup Ready systems are. Mr. Kucinich. I thank the gentleman for his testimony. As I said, your entire testimony will be included in the record of this hearing. I am sure that we will get back to you with some questions. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Freese follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

STATEMENT OF JAY VROOM Mr. Vroom. Thank you, Chairman Kucinich and Congresswoman Watson, for allowing me to come and provide testimony today on behalf of the crop protection industry and CropLife America. Thank you for introducing me earlier. In addition to my role as CEO of our trade association, I also have an Illinois farm background and happen to still own the family farm that I was reared on. I happen to have been in Illinois twice in the last weeks. Six weeks ago I stopped to take a look at one of the fields that is now being operated by my cousin. It was planted this year in Roundup Ready Soybeans. It was planted as a no- till crop, and Mr. Chairman, I would love to share this photograph. There are three of them here. I am most proud of this particular view, because it shows this field in the direction in which a terrace that my father installed as a charter member of our Bureau County, IL, soil and water conservation district, one of the first terraces installed in the country, to provide then the cutting-edge technology for soil conservation at that time. I remember as a youth hand-weeding and hand-cultivating with mechanical means fields of soybeans and other crops on this very field, and we were not able to control the soil erosion as we can today with the Roundup Ready technology. If I can pass this up and maybe ask your staff to share that with you. Mr. Kucinich. We will include it in the record. Without objection, so ordered. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Vroom. Thank you. So conservation tillage is an important component of the introduction of biotechnology. I also have a report by our Crop Protection Research Institute that illustrates on a graph of introduction of modern biotechnology and then the takeoff of the adoption of conservation tillage in this country. It has made a meaningful difference, and I believe there are clear USDA statistics to that effect. Mr. Kucinich. Without objection, that will be included in the record of the hearing. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Vroom. Thank you. My experience, and I just talked to my cousin who was combining soybeans this morning, he assured me that he was aware of weed resistance and he has taken steps to manage it on this particular field, and we know that we don't have the most severe weed-resistance problems with regard to glyphosate situations, as are apparent in some of those million acres that you refer to. Our industry, along with USDA--and unfortunately Ms. Wright probably didn't have adequate time or background to explain to you the full resources the USDA brings to bear with regard to helping farmers manage weed resistance in both biotechnology crops and elsewhere. Extension, our industry scientists, crop consultants that are private individuals, crop input retailers, all have a stake in all of this and we have a marvelous system to help farmers manage these issues. But we do appreciate the fact that you have an interest in examining the regulatory authority of the agencies that are charged with overseeing these technologies, and we look forward to working with you as you give consideration to ways to have oversight and consideration of these matters. Last, I would just tell you that our industry has formed a herbicide resistance action committee. It is a global entity that CropLife and our partner associations around the world are involved with, and it provides a mechanism for the common research that herbicide companies engage in with regard to helping to stay ahead of the curve and ensure that we can manage herbicide resistance in both biotechnology-enhanced crops and conventional crops as well. So we believe that we do have a system in place that allows us to continue to manage these issues. We understand the particular media attention that has been given to herbicide resistance in biotechnology crops, but we believe that we have an adequate system, and we appreciate the attention that you will continue to provide to this issue. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much, Mr. Vroom. [The prepared statement of Mr. Vroom follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Kucinich. I just want to assure you that we provided Ms. Wright with as much time as she needs to be able to answer this committee's questions, and we will continue to do that. Let's go to questions of this second panel. Mr. Miller, with Monsanto's percent focus, as you have said, on agriculture, I am wondering who is responsible for the proliferation of weeds and weed species that have become Roundup-resistant since the introduction of Roundup Ready crop systems? Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I mentioned earlier, if our farmers are not successful, we are not successful, and we take this matter very seriously. I would say herbicide-tolerant weeds is not a new thing. It is something we have had to manage in the industry as well as with university weed scientists and farmers in how they run their operations on their farm. So we invest a lot in the science of weed resistance and understanding that and providing technical solutions to growers along with others. That is really our focus. Mr. Kucinich. I don't know if you have testified before a congressional committee, and all committees are different. Mr. Miller. No, sir. Mr. Kucinich. I am the kind of chairman that when I ask a question, I would like to get a direct answer. Would you tell me who is responsible for the proliferation of weeds and weed species that have become Roundup-resistant since the introduction of Roundup Ready crop systems? Mr. Miller. I think weeds that are resistant to glyphosate are the responsibility of industry, government, weed sciences, as well as farmers, to properly steward the product. Mr. Kucinich. So industry--you are part of the industry with Monsanto. The USDA is part of that system. There is a responsibility there. There is a whole feedback loop here, you are saying; right? Mr. Miller. I think there is a feedback loop, but this is a herbicide issue, and I believe herbicides are regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Kucinich. It is encouraging that you have stated that industry has a responsibility here. But you also stated that government has a responsibility as a regulatory authority, did you not? Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, I believe that our regulatory agencies have clear responsibilities to demonstrate and prove the safety in use of these products. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you. Let me direct your attention to this ad circulated before . This is Monsanto, Mr. Miller, in this ad, telling farmers to use more and more Roundup and to use it exclusively to control weeds. That was just years ago. And it was also years after Roundup-resistant horseweed was discovered in Roundup Ready crop yields in Delaware. Mr. Miller, help us out here. Isn't it true if farmers followed Monsanto's advice conveyed in this ad, that they would have Roundup-resistant weeds in their fields today? Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, weed resistance is caused by many factors. Prior to , and many systems that we developed and co-developed with the university weed science academics and the Weed Science Society of America--and, by the way, I believe one of those academics was actually referenced in that ad just reflecting on a picture I saw--the recommendation was that glyphosate had a low probability of developing resistance, and our recommendation was to utilize that in the system. But in cases where we have begun to discover there are resistant weeds, we have done a lot of training, education with growers, retailers, and other in the industry to recommend multiple modes of actions into our cropping systems. Mr. Kucinich. I am going to ask staff to copy this and give you a copy. Have you read this? Just look at it. I'm not trying to trap you here, because I believe in having a conversation. It says no benefit in rotating glyphosate. No benefit. Can you explain that to me in light of what you said a moment ago? Take your time. When you are ready to answer, go ahead. If you want to rephrase anything for the record, you can do that, too. Mr. Miller. Actually, I would like to read the recommendation as stated by Monsanto in this particular article. In many Midwest cropping systems, agronomic conditions and cultural practice are conducive to preemergent application, an herbicide that is not glyphosate, so one mode of action, followed by Roundup agriculture herbicides, or a tank mix of residual, two different modes of action, agricultural herbicide before weeds exceed inches. So this particular ad does actually steward two growers, and I am responding to the title, ``No Benefit from Rotating Glyphosate,'' was the fact that you use multiple modes of action in your system, and if you use a Roundup Ready crop in the same field the next year, and you steward it properly by using multiple modes of action, there is no need to change your overall cropping system. Mr. Kucinich. This is your ad. It says, no benefit in rotating glyphosate, as you just read. Now, I showed the same ad and asked the same question to a prominent weed scientist who testified at our previous hearing. I am sure that somebody in your organization read that testimony. He was the author of the weed chapter of the National Research Council's report published in April. Do you want to guess what his response was to the question of whether farmers would have Roundup-resistant weeds in their fields today if they followed the advice that was conveyed in Monsanto's ads? What do you think his answer was? Mr. Miller. Chairman Kucinich, I wouldn't want to speculate on that. Mr. Kucinich. OK. That is fine. It is recommended reading for you. His answer was ``yes.'' Mr. Miller, why was the discovery of Roundup-resistant horseweed as early as the year not sufficient evidence of Roundup resistance in weeds to move Monsanto to change its advice to farmers? Mr. Miller. Congressman, first of all, I will go back to if our growers are not successful, we are not successful. So as we actually had the evidence of the first resistant weeds, we actually enabled university research, our own research, to understand the mechanism of that resistance. The second thing that we did was enlisted those regional university extension agents to help us develop what the recommendation for the grower was in order to keep their farming operations successful. Once we had that identified, we actually went out and did significant training with producers, often recommending our competitor's product as part of the solution to ensure that the farmer has a weed-free field. Mr. Kucinich. Let me just share something with you. About hours ago, I was in a full committee hearing with Johnson & Johnson looking at how they let two different products enter the market, one of which had potential serious health consequences for consumers. And one of these drugs, they sent in phantom purchasers to get the drug back. There was active concealment going on. The thing that strikes me that you said about if your customers are not successful, you are not successful. You said that earlier in your testimony. I actually wrote it down here. If farmers don't succeed, Monsanto does not succeed. It is eerily similar almost to the words except changing ``Johnson & Johnson'' to ``Monsanto'' to the testimony of the CEO of Johnson & Johnson. That is the reason I am calling it to your attention. I don't question your background. You have a tremendous background and you are certainly qualified to testify before this subcommittee. There is no question about that. You represent Monsanto well. The question I have is the aspirational expressions that you make on behalf of Monsanto do not square with the experiential elements of the use of this crop. That is kind of where we are going with this. I am not condemning you; I just want to say that there is some difficulty in squaring this. Now, Mr. Freese, is it true that Roundup-resistant weeds was a development that took everyone, including Monsanto, by surprise? Or was it a foreseen danger? Mr. Freese. I think it was mixed. I know there were some weed scientists who thought there wouldn't be resistance evolving, but others predicted it. Mr. Kucinich. Some were surprised? Mr. Freese. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. What about you? Mr. Freese. I wasn't following the issue at the time. Mr. Kucinich. But you have a report; isn't that right? Mr. Freese. A report, yes, by some colleagues in the public interest community called ``Biotechnologies: Bitter Harvest.'' It is a very searching and comprehensive report on what at that time was still an experimental technology. , this was years before the introduction of the first Roundup Ready crop--in this report the scientists clearly see huge potential for development of herbicide-resistant weeds, and particularly with this technology. There was a report by Consumers Union, another consumer group. Mr. Kucinich. So you are saying that scientists did see the potential for herbicide-resistant weeds. Which scientists are you talking about? Mr. Freese. This report was written by Dr. Rebecca Goldberg with Environmental Defense Fund; and Jane Rissler, who is now with Union of Concerned Scientists; and Hope Shand and Chuck Hassebrook. Mr. Kucinich. What year was that? Mr. Freese. . Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Miller, you have been with Monsanto since , right? Mr. Miller. That is correct. Mr. Kucinich. I actually took notes during your testimony, and you said in your testimony that Monsanto has scientists who work for the company. Did you say that? Mr. Miller. Actually, sir, my statement was that in my regulatory group there are scientists. There are over a couple of thousand scientists in our company. Mr. Kucinich. That is even more impressive. A couple thousand scientists. Do you have any knowledge within the sphere of your activities in the regulatory group of any reports that were brought to you expressing concerns about herbicide-resistant crops? Mr. Miller. I was not in that responsibility at that time. But I can say---- Mr. Kucinich. When did you come into that responsibility? Mr. Miller. Just in the last months, sir. But I have been in the company years as a researcher. I can share with you that I think it is even documented in literature that with the Roundup or glyphosate tolerance, we stated there was a possibility. We said it was a low probability. And I would say anytime we develop any of our products, as I mentioned earlier, including with Mr. Smith here, before we develop them, we actually create forums to understand the data that is out there and the concerns that exist, and take that into consideration as we develop our safe products. Mr. Kucinich. What I would like to do, and I want to direct the subcommittee staff here to work with Mr. Miller in gaining access to the studies that were done by the scientists at Monsanto with respect to herbicide-resistant weeds, because what we can do here is to be able to identify the progress that has been made through this scientific research with the scientists who are working for you and perhaps thousands of scientists who are working with Monsanto. So we will produce from this hearing a followup request for documents so that we can enable a better understanding of Monsanto's awareness of this. I would appreciate your cooperation. Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to work with you on that request. Ms. Watson. Mr. Chairman, can you yield just minutes to me? I have another subcommittee hearing. Mr. Kucinich. I am pleased to yield to the gentlelady at this moment. I was going to yield minutes to you. If you need minutes, you can have it now. Ms. Watson. Thank you. I won't use all of that time. I am very interested in this subject matter, because just recently they announced that there is a new salmon that is going to be on the market that has been, shall I say, biologically bred to grow larger, and you might recall some of the advertisements in the last few days. We are questioning whether that will have an impact on humans once they consume that salmon. And so I was listening very closely to see if Monsanto or other companies like you test the environmental impact of these new--what you are working with is an herbicide--but do you test first to see what the impact will be on the environment. Or does it grow? The chair is asking for you to kind of document what was done prior to putting it on the market, and I am wondering how far do you go putting these products out there before you test their effect on the environment? Mr. Miller. Would you like me to answer that? Ms. Watson. Yes. Mr. Miller. OK. You know, I am very proud of the process that we use both to validate the value that we bring to growers, as well as the safety of our products. As you know, the products that we have put out on the market , if it is a chemistry, it is EPA. Biotech, it could be EPA, USDA, FDA. All of those go through thorough health and safety assessments both internally in our organization as well as with those agencies. Often we have other third parties that look into that, because at the end of the day, we want to ensure the health and safety, and we believe that system has worked extremely well. Ms. Watson. What do you feel you have to do now in light of this, the findings that this superweed is so strong that it doesn't react to whatever you have out there to try to kill it? It is going to have an impact, and it is going to have a financial impact certainly on the farmers and all. And so what do you see that needs to be done? We are the subcommittee of oversight. What is it that we can do within this process to guarantee that people won't be harmed, crops won't be harmed? What needs to be done? What are we missing? Mr. Miller. Chairman Watson, I am not sure I can address the question of what we are missing, but I can address what we are doing. I think this is being taken very seriously by Monsanto, as well as other technology providers in the industry. I think it is being taken extremely seriously by weed scientists. And as was mentioned by Jay earlier, our growers take this very seriously, even before they have weed-resistance issues. What we are doing about it, we have invested well over $ million in just the last years. Mr. Kucinich. If the gentleman would suspend. Ms. Wright, I just want to put it on the record that Ms. Wright did stay for most of the testimony because that doesn't always happen, and I want to thank you for your presence here and for listening to the witnesses' testimony and questions. Thank you very much. I just wanted to put that on the record. If you are ready to continue, you may. Thank you. Mr. Miller. Yes. So we are putting significant research, as well as working with those local academics to help come up with best recommendation for farmers. Two things that I want to bring out. There are glyphosate- resistant weeds, but there are still greater than weeds that do not have resistance, so this is still a hugely available tool to growers, and they acknowledge that every time I go out and visit with them. I am not going to diminish the fact that if one of the weeds is resistant to glyphosate, that there needs to be a control option provided for that grower, and we actually have spent a lot of time, even with the ad that was shown earlier, working on that particular species of weed. There are control options available on the market, and we are helping growers be trained on how to use that in their agricultural systems. Ms. Watson. I am really concerned about the consumer side of all of these new products that are out there, and so we are going back and the chair is asking that we have some documentation so that we can guarantee that we who have the oversight have done all we can to ensure that these products will not have a negative effect on whatever it is, and on consumers. So we are just probing right now to see what our responsibilities are. And if you are looking at evaluating the environmental impacts of your product, I want to say thank you so much. That is what I would like to know. And I am sure that the chair has also asked for that information. With that, I will wait to see it. As we probe in this area, Mr. Chairman, I want to be a partner with you. I am really concerned about that new--does anybody remember seeing the information on television? If so, put your hand up. I want to know about this salmon that is going to be three or four times the size of any normally grown salmon. If we are to consume it, what is the impact going to be on our digestive systems with this larger salmon? So in all good faith, we are just asking you to let us know what we need to look at so we can protect the consumers. Thank you very much. Mr. Kucinich. I thank the gentlewoman for her questions. The subcommittee is also looking at the issues with respect to genetically engineered salmon. I want to say, when the gentlelady asked the question, What are we missing, she was actually inviting Mr. Miller to help us in our probe here. But I would say this; that we look forward to cooperating with you, that cooperation through information that brings us to a level of comfort that the public interest is being protected. And in pursuit of the public interest, we try not to miss too much. Mr. Miller, you have heard testimony today about concerns that your dicamba/Roundup-tolerant soybean will cause collateral injury to fruit and vegetable farmers, and I would add, even backyard gardeners. That is essentially what Mr. Smith was testifying to. Your testimony, in fact, acknowledges concerns. Now, in the event that an injury should materialize, apropos of a question Mr. Smith raised, who would be liable for the economic costs to the affected farmers? Would it be Monsanto or another party? Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, you know, I am not an attorney. Mr. Kucinich. I am not either. I just play one on TV. Mr. Miller. I don't believe I can answer that. We would be happy to followup with you later at the appropriate time when we have that information. Mr. Kucinich. I will accept you are not an attorney and you don't want to answer a question that gets you, excuse the expression, into the weeds about the legal implications of this policy. But I would say that we would seek to entertain that discussion with Monsanto attorneys, because this is one of the questions that is being raised here. You have a product, if it has some adverse effect on certain people, there are some questions of liability. I am not asking you to accept liability here. I know what your limitations are as a witness at this moment. You made that clear. But let me ask you this: Do you think it is correct to classify the injury fruit and vegetable farmers fear from the use of the dicamba soybean system as an indirect cost of the development of Roundup resistance in weeds? Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, I am not sure that I follow your question. I would appreciate if you could restate it. Mr. Kucinich. Well, you have Roundup resistance in weeds that is showing up. Farmers are concerned, and some farmers have expressed that there has been an injury to their fruits and vegetables. You have sold this dicamba soybean system. If the farmers are experiencing this loss, isn't that loss essentially an off-loading of expense, an indirect cost of the development of Roundup resistance in weeds? Mr. Miller. You know, we are years away from introducing dicamba/Roundup Ready soybeans into the market. So as we bring these forward--and it takes us well over a decade from the time we begin to develop these products until we launch it-- years before the launch, we actually set up a dicamba grower or dicamba advisory council, including many of the producers in the fruit, vineyard, and tomato industry. And by the way, as Monsanto, we are one of the largest vegetable seed producers in the world. Tomato customers in that business are some of our biggest customers. And as I mentioned earlier, we care about our customers' success. Our focus is to continue to bring weed-free cropping systems to our producers in corn, soybean, and cotton, as well as serve the interest of those fruit and vegetable producers. We have a significant amount of research going on, with their input, to ensure when that product comes on the market it is successfully implemented. Mr. Kucinich. Do you have legal counsel here with you? Mr. Miller. Yes, I do. Mr. Kucinich. Would counsel identify himself, please? Mr. Sopko. John Sopko of Akin Gump. Mr. Kucinich. OK. Actually, I know you gave an answer. You didn't answer the question; but if I pressed you to answer the question, I know counsel would advise you not to, so I will move on. Mr. Freese, can you answer the question I asked about do you think it is correct to classify the injury fruit and vegetable farmers fear from the use of the dicamba soybean system as an indirect cost of the development of Roundup resistance in weeds? Mr. Freese. I think that is very good way to describe it. The way that the Roundup Ready crop system is used and is meant to be used, I would say it has led to some pretty massive weed resistance. Unfortunately, the way we approach weeds in this country is so completely focused, so completely focused on using pesticides, that a new herbicide-resistant crop, resistance to different herbicides, seems to be the only thing that a lot of our companies and even the USDA takes seriously. In fact, there are many very viable, nonchemical ways to control weeds. Mr. Kucinich. I am going to go back to Mr. Smith here, because you are in touch with a base of people about these products. You have testified, and I am quoting from your testimony, ``The widespread use of dicamba is incompatible with Midwestern agriculture.'' Mr. Smith. Yes, sir. Mr. Kucinich. I am from Ohio. I hear that. How significant is the risk of injury to fruit and vegetable farmers and processors from planting the dicamba soybean in Indiana farm fields, and do you have any estimate of potential cost? Mr. Smith. We are working on providing an estimate of that through a study with Purdue University at this time. Mr. Kucinich. Would you produce that to the subcommittee when that is done? Mr. Smith. Yes. Mr. Kucinich. You testified, ``Increased dicamba usage, made possible through the introduction of dicamba-tolerant soybeans, is poor public policy and shouldn't be allowed.'' Is there is a technological fix to the collateral harm you foresee occurring, such as having Monsanto develop dicamba- resistant fruit trees, melons, peas and tomatoes; is that the path we should take? Mr. Smith. From a consumer standpoint, that is a path we cannot take. Mr. Kucinich. Why? Mr. Smith. There is consumer resistance to the consumption of genetically modified crops. Mr. Kucinich. Why? Mr. Smith. I am not an expert to answer that. Mr. Kucinich. You don't have to answer. Mr. Miller, your testimony explains that the dicamba/ Roundup soybean is designed to ``give growers more weed control options.'' It sounds somewhat artful. It sounds like an artful way of saying that farmers can't rely on Roundup to control weeds anymore, so they now need to use another pesticide. Is it your belief, Mr. Miller, that the best solution to Roundup resistance in weeds is a farmer using another pesticide? Mr. Miller. I would say my belief, a broad array of university scientists, other industry scientists, the Weed Science Society of America, believes that adding multiple modes of action into an agricultural production system is good agricultural practice, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you. Mr. Freese, is the only or best way to control weeds after Roundup resistance has set in more and more chemicals and new chemical-tolerant crops? Mr. Freese. I think that is actually a very dangerous path to take. Mr. Kucinich. Why? Mr. Freese. We are learning lots of new things about weed resistance, and new mechanisms are being discovered all of the time. Mr. Kucinich. Why is it dangerous? You used the word ``dangerous.'' What do you mean? Mr. Freese. I think it is dangerous because it is going to lead to greater resistance down the line. Mr. Kucinich. How do you know that? Mr. Freese. Because what we have seen is an increase in multiple herbicide-resistant weeds already. Mr. Kucinich. So you use more chemicals. And we had testimony earlier from Ann Wright about the evolution of crops that contain herbicide resistance generally, right? Mr. Freese. Yes. So, for instance, in the eighties and nineties, a popular class of herbicides was called the ALS inhibitor. Mr. Kucinich. And ALS stands for? Mr. Freese. Acetolactate synthase. And they generated a huge expanse of herbicide-resistant weeds, and those resistant weeds were one reason farmers adopted Roundup Ready crops. Now we are getting weed populations that are resistant to both herbicides. In Missouri and Illinois, we have weed populations resistant to three and four different herbicides. Mr. Kucinich. For those who are not initiated, what are the implications of that? Draw out for us the practical implications that this scenario that you envision happening as a result of your scientific background--tell us where we are going. Mr. Freese. Well, we are headed toward more pesticide use, for one thing. That is pretty clear. At the last superweed hearing, one of the weed scientists spoke on the order of a percent increase in , -D and dicamba use soon after the introduction of the , -D and dicamba-resistant soybeans. Mr. Kucinich. What happens then? Mr. Freese. One thing is you have greater levels of these residues of these herbicides on the crop. A little-known fact about herbicide-resistant crops is the companies seek increases in what are called tolerances, the maximum allowable residue of the pesticide on the crop. We have seen that repeatedly with Roundup Ready, greatly increased glyphosate tolerances each time a new Roundup Ready crop is approved. Now, it is very troublesome when we think about that with more toxic herbicides like , -D and dicamba, both of which have been linked to cancer in pesticide applicators and farmers. , -D is a likely endocrine disrupter; that is, a disrupter of our hormone systems which are so important in controlling our development, our reproductive system, and our metabolism. EPA was supposed to start looking at endocrine effects on all of our pesticides in , but hasn't been funded to do that, and so it is only just now getting started. Mr. Kucinich. Are there any weed scientists to recommend an approach other than Monsanto's preference for dealing with weed resistance to their product Roundup. Mr. Freese. Can you restate that? Mr. Kucinich. Is there another approach that weed scientists would recommend in dealing with this problem of resistance? Mr. Freese. Yeah, and as a matter of fact, it's quite interesting because there is a technique that's long been used by organic growers, but also conventional growers. It involves planting winter cover crops. And basically it just--it means after harvest of the main crop, you can plant a cereal like rye, or a legume like hairy vetch or clover. And this cover crop grows in the fall, and then more in the spring, and it holds the soil, and it also absorbs excess nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizer. And then in the spring, it's killed off and forms a thick mat into which you can plant your main crop, that mat suppresses weeds physically. Sometimes the cover crop also releases chemicals that inhibit the growth of weeds. It's a very, very beneficial practice, because again, it's effective--it effectively suppresses weeds and provides multiple other benefits as well. Mr. Kucinich. All right. I want to thank you for answering that. Did you want to add something, Mr. Vroom? Mr. Vroom. Yes, Mr. Chairman. So we've delved into a lot of detail, but one important broad category of differentiation among weed control with regard to crop protection products is whether the chemistry is used after the weeds emerge, are sprayed on to the weeds, or it's applied to the soil as a pre- emergent control product. The ALS herbicide Mr. Freese is talking about are pre- emergent products, they are applied to the soil before the crop is planted. And so the--while the registrants for those chemicals that are pre-emergent products oftentimes do have protective tolerance levels, should some tiny amount be left in the soil and then get into the crop plant, there's virtually no evidence of residual in the actual crop from those kinds of products that are applied by the farmers. So big difference there between the technologies that all herbicides aren't applied the same way. And again, I think we come back to the industry, farmers, the USDA and the extension are all looking at redeploying a lot of old technologies--I'm certain that Monsanto and others have already reinvented some of the formulation technologies so that it can be better managed than it was when that particular product was more prominently used. And so it's all part of the solution, and I think what you're drawing out here is that we all have to work together, reinvent old products, because we also have evidence, and I've got a study here that I would also like to ask you to consider submitting into the record by---- Mr. Kucinich. You can submit it. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Vroom. McDougal organization that shows that in the decade of the 's and 's, our crop protection companies were able to discover and bring to market more than new herbicide products. In the decade of the 's, that number has dropped to . And so it's just a reminder that while our research goes on, we found the ease to discover and most broad spectrum efficacious herbicides, and now we're needing--now we're looking for things that are much more targeted and the need to reinvent the older products that are proven safe that can be reformulated and applied by farmers in different ways. Thank you. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much. I would just like to say in response to the point that you raise something that's obvious, that we're really probing here into cause and effect. Some causal chains begin in nature. With biotechnology and genetic engineering, some causal chains begin in the laboratory. So we just are trying to find out which way things are going here, and doing the best we can. Mr. Vroom. Thank you. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you for being here. I want to thank each of the witnesses. You've given this subcommittee additional information; we'll continue to seek more. We're going to do it in a dispassionate way. Just try to gather information so that we can recommend policies that would be in the best interest of all parties concerned. I do take note of Mr. Miller's testimony that government does have a role to play, it's not only the industry that's the question here, and I appreciate that you raise that. So without any further testimony, this is the Domestic Policy Subcommittee of Oversight and Government Reform. The subject of today's hearing ``Are `Superweeds' an Outgrowth of USDA Biotech Policy?'' This is the second part of this hearing. The subcommittee will continue to retain jurisdiction over this matter. I want to thank the staff for its presence here today and its participation in helping to structure this hearing. There being no--and thank the witnesses certainly. There being no further businesses before this subcommittee, this subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank you. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] [Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T .

YEAR COMPUTER PROBLEM: DID THE WORLD OVERREACT, AND WHAT DID WE LEARN? ---------- THURSDAY, JANUARY , House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology, Committee on Government Reform, joint with the Subcommittee on Technology, Committee on Science, Washington, DC. The subcommittees met, pursuant to notice, at a.m., in room , Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Stephen Horn (chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology) presiding. Present for the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology: Representatives Horn, Biggert, Walden, and Turner. Staff present for the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology: J. Russell George, staff director and chief counsel; Mathew Ryan, senior policy director; Bonnie Heald, director of communications and professional staff member; Chip Ahlswede, clerk; Deborah Oppenheim, intern; Michelle Ash and Trey Henderson, minority counsels; and Jean Gosa, minority clerk. Present for the Subcommittee on Technology: Representatives Morella, Green, Barcia, Wu, and Baird. Staff present for the Subcommittee on Technology: Jeff Grove, staff director; Ben Wu, counsel; Michael Quear, minority professional staff member; and Marty Ralston, minority staff assistant. Mr. Horn. This joint hearing of the House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology, and the House Subcommittee on Technology will come to order. It is now days into the new millennium. The lights are still on, telephones keep ringing, and the airplanes are still flying. So far, the biggest challenge, at least here on the east coast, is shoveling through the mountainous snowdrifts dumped by the first major storm of the year . Thanks to the hard work of thousands of dedicated people at a cost in the billions of dollars, we have the luxury of meeting today to discuss the benefits that have been derived from the year computer challenge. Over the past years, these subcommittees have spent countless hours examining the Federal Government's computer preparations for the year , or Y K. When we began this process in April , two Cabinet Secretaries had never heard of Y K, much less begun preparing for it. That ultimately changed, but not without congressional prodding through hearings and report cards, grading agencies on their progress. In addition to fixing all of the government's , mission-critical computer systems, the subcommittees expected agencies to develop viable contingency plans in case those computer fixes did not work. We prodded, we questioned, and we hoped for the best, and the best happened. The Federal Government experienced a successful transition into the new millennium. Some glitches did occur, however, giving cause to wonder what might have happened if the work had not been completed. I am inserting in the hearing record a statement stressing that without the work of many in the executive and legislative branches, it would not have been as successful. Without objection, that will be in the record at this point. The Defense Department had problems with its surveillance satellites. Some retailers were unable to process customer credit card purchases. A Chicago area bank was unable to process Medicare payments. As far as we know, those isolated problems were quickly repaired. Some still question whether other incidents might have occurred, but were unexpected due to a fix first, report later mentality. Successfully meeting the year challenge has provided many lessons that must not be ignored or forgotten. The unextendable deadline forced government leaders to focus on information technology issues. Program and technology personnel worked intensely and closely to get the job done. In addition, government agencies and private sector organizations were forced to develop detailed inventories of their technology resources and computer systems, in many cases for the first time. Unnecessary and obsolete systems have hopefully been discarded. Finally, government agencies and their partners have tested and retested data flows at unprecedented levels. Strong teamwork and rugged determination solved the year problem. Some critics now question whether the high cost of this massive effort was necessary. The best estimates currently indicate that the executive branch will spend more than $ billion on year fixes. The Secretary of Commerce has reported that the United States will have spent about $ billion on the effort as a whole. Was that money well spent? Of course it was. The executive branch of the Federal Government has not always been known as a careful steward of the citizens' money, regardless of what party is in power. Large corporations have waste also, and those that are publicly traded could not afford to squander hundreds of millions of dollars on unnecessary computer problems and contingency plans. Boards of directors and stockholders would not permit it. Whether large or small, successful businesses rarely fritter away money. This was a massive problem that required a massive solution. We are grateful to everyone who contributed the many ideas, solutions, and hard work that led to the success of this effort, from government personnel to grassroots organizations and the private sector. Thank you all for a job well done. Today we welcome some of those dedicated leaders. The Honorable John Koskinen, Assistant to the President and Chair of the President's Council on Year Conversion; Mr. Joel Willemssen, Director of Civil Agencies Information Systems for the General Accounting Office; the Honorable Charles Rossotti, Commissioner of Internal Revenue; Mr. Fernando Burbano, Chief Information Officer of the Department of State and cochairman of the Security Privacy and Infrastructure Committee of the Chief Information Officer Council; Mr. Harris Miller, president of Information Technology Association of America; Ms. Kathy Hotka, vice president for Information Technology of the National Retail Federation; and, last, Mr. Gary Beach, publisher of the CIO Communications, Inc. I might say that is a very distinguished magazine, and I read it regularly. We welcome each of you, and look forward to your testimony. It is a pleasure to first introduce Mr. John Koskinen, special assistant to the President, Chairman, President's Council on Year Conversion. [The prepared statement of Hon. Stephen Horn follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Horn. I now yield for opening statement from the cochairman of the task force, Mrs. Morella, the gentlewoman from Maryland. Mrs. Morella. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We will hear from Mr. Koskinen and the very prominent panel very shortly. I appreciate having this hearing. I think it is important that we look back at what has happened, and in particular, look ahead to the future. If I had told everyone in this room a month ago that in January the Federal Government would shut down for days and virtually the entire southeast and northeast would be crippled, most likely everyone would have immediately blamed Y K millennium bug and not mother nature. Yet it took a blizzard of snow and ice to accomplish what many doomsayers had predicted long ago for the millennium bug. So how is it that a winter storm caused more damage and inconveniences than the Y K problem? In the ensuing weeks since the passage of January , , similar questions have been posted. Was the Y K problem real or was it overhyped? Was the $ billion spent in the United States, roughly $ for every American citizen overall? Did all of our efforts stave off an impending disaster, or was Y K simply a nonevent waiting to happen? In my mind, there is no doubt the problem was real. From the very first hearing that my technology subcommittee conducted in the spring of , to right up to the final month of December , we witnessed systems failing Y K tests and crashing completely. Our concern for the Y K issue was initially so great and disturbing that we have held almost hearings in both the House and the Senate on the issue, which I understand makes Y K the single most thoroughly investigated issue ever in the history of congressional oversight. Ultimately, I believe two factors tipped the balance from the grave uncertainty many of us harbored in the beginning. The first was that we all knew the Y K problem would strike on a certain date, January , , thereby allowing us to collectively plan, coordinate and collaborate toward that deadline. The other and more significant factor was that after over a year and a half of persistent cajoling by Congress, after we realized this, our Nation required executive action to effectively combat the Y K problem, the President finally exercised his authority in the spring of . Y K was suddenly catapulted to become a top administration management priority, and John Koskinen was appointed to oversee our Federal Government's efforts and to partner with our Nation's private sector and with other countries internationally. John certainly deserves a great deal of accolades for his stewardship. The well-deserved cheers I wanted to point out to for our victory in vanquishing the millennium bug should also go to those who ably served in the front lines of this epic battle, all the dedicated Federal employees, public servants and professionals who were the technicians, and those who gave countless hours on their holidays to provide assurance to the American people that our Nation would be prepared for Y K. I think the fact that nothing of disastrous proportions happened does not mean that nothing would have happened. For example, the American Banking Association reported that, but for the $ billion in Y K fixes, mortgage calculations would have been incorrect, direct deposit of pay and government benefits would have been problematic, and credit cards could not be read due to problems with expiration dates. Similarly, the telecommunications industry reported that the $ . billion that they spent over the past to years prevented the potential gradual deterioration of public switch telephone network performance, including slow response times for dial tone access as well as interruptions of service. The result of our Y K experience is a testament to the fact that we prepared well and we invested properly. I believe, however, the investments were not just about Y K, but also about improving our Nation's information technology systems and gaining knowledge about those systems. That is the focus of our hearing today. This hearing is not designed to simply pat each other on the back or to allow our panelists to take a figurative victory lap around the witness table, but to ascertain the lessons that we learned from our Y K experience. Will Y K inspire a conscious effort for greater long-term planning and more reliable and secure technology, or will it just prolong the shortsighted thinking that made Y K so costly? While many systems have relays replaced, some programs were fixed by applying a Y K patch that will require another round of fixes within the next two decades. I look forward to addressing these and many other issues with our distinguished panel of witnesses, most of whom have appeared before us on many occasions. It is only appropriate that since this is the absolutely positively final last and ultimate hearing of the House Y K Task Force, we close with those who have been involved with this issue since the very beginning. Perhaps this hearing can provide the foundation for initiatives as we address the -digit computer date problem, Y K as it may come to be known. If so at that time, maybe Steve Horn and I can chair that task force, along with Strom Thurmond in the Senate. I would like to extend my deep appreciation to all the members of my technology subcommittee and Congressman Horn's government management subcommittee and his leadership for the years of vigilant and cooperative bipartisan initiatives, and I especially want to acknowledge the hard work of my ranking member, Jim Barcia, and certainly Chairman Horn, the distinguished cochair of the task force, and Jim Turner of the government management subcommittee, ranking member, and the members of both subcommittees who have been very dedicated, and I yield back. Thank you. Mr. Horn. We thank you so much for your nice words for all the Members, and all of our witnesses. We agree with you, and I am delighted to now yield to the gentleman who has been here right from the beginning of his duties as the ranking member on the side of the subcommittee on government management, Mr. Turner from Texas. We are delighted you could make it out of the snow, if you have any down there, and into Washington for this meeting. So thank you very much for all you have done to help us in the field hearings and everywhere else. Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When I left Texas the other day, it was degrees. I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairwoman Morella, for the good work you have done. This task force and these two committees were about a \ / \-year project. As I recall, my staff advised me we had different hearings of this subcommittee alone on this subject. Many observers say that the Y K problem was the greatest management challenge the Federal Government has faced, and perhaps that is true. I think most of us had a high degree of confidence after the many hearings that we had that we would make it through January st without great problems, but nobody really knew for sure. The fact we did make it I am sure is due, in large part, to the hard work you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairwoman Morella, have made in an effort to make sure the Federal Government is ready. I also want to commend the ranking member of the science subcommittee, Mr. Barcia, and I want to thank Mr. Williamson. He worked very diligently, met with this committee time and time again, and I think, in large part, usual efforts helped us get to where we needed to go. Of course, Mr. Koskinen and the President's Y K council, I think, did an outstanding job. I really felt sorry for you when I was watching you on television on New Year's Day and you kept holding these press conferences with nothing to say. That is the worst nightmare of any politician, that somehow we would have a press conference and there is nothing to say. But you seemed to have survived it well, and you and your council did an outstanding job working not only with the public sector and Federal agencies, but reaching out to the private sector to ensure that we got to where we needed to go. That is not to say there weren't significant potential problems. As I recall from many of our hearings, we tried to ask witnesses that came before us to tell us what they fixed, what would happen if they had not been diligent about remediation of their Y K problems, and some of the stories we heard clearly convinced me that all of the effort and all of the work that took place was needed, did accomplish the desired result, and the fact that we had no great crisis on January was to the credit of all of those many thousands of people who spent countless hours and millions of dollars to remediate the problem. We are here today not to congratulate ourselves, but to look back and to review the results of our efforts, to see what lessons we have learned. I feel confident we are better prepared as a Nation to meet a future national emergency than we have ever been in terms of keeping our computer systems working, which, of course, every facet of our life now depends upon our computers working well. So I think we are going to have a good hearing today, and I appreciate all the witnesses being here. Again, I would like to thank Chairman Horn and Chairwoman Morella for the good work that you did. Mr. Horn. Well, thank you very much. You have sure been with us since the ground floor, and we have another person who has been with us ever since she has been elected to Congress, and the gentlewoman from Illinois, Mrs. Biggert, we have held hearings in her area, which is a wonderful suburb outside of Chicago, and we appreciate your regular attendance at these meetings and the contributions you have made in staff meetings and Member meetings. So thank you very much for coming to this hearing. The gentlewoman from Illinois, Mrs. Biggert. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you, Chairman Horn and Chairwoman Morella. Let me thank you for calling this hearing on the impact of the Y K date change. Contrary to what some people felt might happen, the planes didn't fall from the sky when the clock struck midnight, telephones retained their dial tones, water still ran from the faucets and America's New Year's celebrations were not left in the dark. So I think we had a good new year. But remarkably, and a little bit surprisingly, substantial Y K problems were not experienced out of this country either, despite the lack of preparation on the part of some of the nations' computers and other essential services across the globe. We really saw no major disruptions. But as this committee heard numerous times during its hearings, Y K-related glitches could have had a substantial and extremely negative impact on the variety of services, the smooth turnover from into is directly related, I think, to the billions of dollars and hundreds of man-hours directed toward preventing and correcting potential Y K problems. I think it goes without saying that from what we have seen, or seen thus far relating to Y K disruptions, that these efforts paid off handsomely. Y K preparations paid off in other ways as well as a result of the Y K concerns; there are now thousands more American families that own the equipment, such as generators needed to prepare for other types of emergencies, namely snowstorms, floods and hurricanes. All of my family, even my -month-old grandson, now have new flashlights and fresh new batteries. Government leaders on every level now have a better understanding of technology, management issues and are aware of the importance of cooperation between local, State and Federal officials. What is more, the millennium bug provided a reason to upgrade government technology systems and to inventory resources. So just being able to say some weeks after the year rollover, it turned out to be a positive experience, that is a testament to the hard work of the House Y K task force and to the leadership of Chairman Horn and Chairman Morella, and it is also a testament to the efforts of today's witnesses, particularly Mr. Koskinen and Mr. Willemssen and the others at the General Accounting Office. Your work over the last--at least years in raising awareness and highlighting the potential problems related to the Y K date change is to be recognized and commended. I don't want to leave you with the impression that Y K glitches didn't occur. In fact, at least one bank in my home State of Illinois did experience some Y K problems when it was temporarily unable to make some Medicare transactions. The Federal Government, I don't think, was immune either. Three of the Federal Housing Administration mission-critical systems experienced problems shortly after January st. So we are here today really, I think, to see if there are any outstanding Y K issues and to sort out what went right and what went wrong, and to help the American people understand what transpired on January , , and let them know about the significant long-term benefits this situation provided to our government and to private industry. So, again, I commend the men for calling the hearing today and for all the work you have both done on this important issue and look forward to hearing from the witnesses. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Hon. Judy Biggert follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Horn. Well, thank you very much. I now yield to the gentleman from Oregon, Mr. Walden, who has been with us in field hearings and a faithful worker in the very active work of these subcommittees. Mr. Walden, the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. Walden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to extend my appreciation to the work you have done and others on this committee certainly for bird-dogging this issue throughout the last year or more. I think in large measure, the report cards that you issued were a very positive step in not only notifying our own agencies, but the world, where we stood and proved to be a very effective technique for spurring on the changes that needed to be made to cope with the Y K issue. In my other life, I was a small business owner, and I can tell you Y K was not a cheap thing to go through. Our own little company spent well over $ , in upgrading software. I know that I am not alone in the small business community in that respect. So there was an enormous amount of capital spent to deal with this issue, and hopefully the programmers who will deal with the K issue, I won't have to help pay for them down the road. But I think it was an excellent exercise. I think it forced both of us in both the government and private industry to do an incredible amount of improvement to our software and to our hardware. That should help us down the road in a competitive status as well. So, Mr. Chairman, I again want to thank you for your tireless efforts to make that the country was ready, and I look forward to hearing from our panelists as well. Thank you. Mr. Horn. I thank the gentleman for your kindness. The next gentleman has also been very active since he has come here in the last election, Mr. Green of Wisconsin, Mark Green. He has been faithfully working on some of these problems and has a whole series of other things he wants us to consider too, and we will. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no comments at this time, but will look forward to the testimony. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. Now it is a great pleasure to present the person that put the executive branch together, where it was no question it wasn't going anywhere until the President picked Mr. Koskinen out of retirement, who delayed his trip to France to have time for retirement after his position as Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget. You did a great job, John, and we are delighted to have you here with your thoughts as to what happened and what did we learn from it, and what can we use from it. STATEMENTS OF JOHN KOSKINEN, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ON YEAR CONVERSION; JOEL C. WILLEMSSEN, DIRECTOR, CIVIL AGENCIES INFORMATION SYSTEMS, U.S. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE; CHARLES ROSSOTTI, COMMISSIONER, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE; AND FERNANDO BURBANO, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, DEPARTMENT OF STATE Mr. Koskinen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. I am pleased to appear once again before this joint session of the subcommittees to discuss the activities of the President's Council on Year Conversion and the Nation's successful transition to the year . With your permission, I will submit my full statement to the record and summarize it here. I appreciate everyone's kind comments and would like to acknowledge as well the work of your subcommittees in helping to prepare the Federal Government and the country for the century date change. I appreciate your work and I think it deserves recognition as we look back on what has been truly a remarkable effort. I continued to believe that Y K was the greatest management challenge the world has faced in the last years. Given the size of the task, it is easy to understand why just or years ago many serious people who had looked at the situation maintained there was no way the work could be finished in time. When I returned to the government in March to work on Y K, things were fairly grim. The consensus was the government wouldn't make it. In the private sector, information bottlenecks were widespread and companies weren't saying much about their own readiness for Y K. On top of all that, the World Bank released a study showing that three-quarters of the world's countries had no Y K plans at all. In short, Y K looked too mammoth, too complicated and too interconnected to be solvable. Now, almost years later, the United States and much of the world have made the transition into the year with few problems that have had a noticeable impact on the general public. How did it hatch? It wasn't by accident. There was a tremendous mobilization of people and resources to make sure that systems would operate effectively into the year . Domestically, participants in key infrastructure sectors, such as electric power, telecommunications finance and transportation devoted great attention and resources to the problem, and as we moved to the ends of the year, operators of systems in those areas stated they were basically done with their Y K work. We reported this information in our last quarterly assessment, and, as we expected, there were no major infrastructure failures, nationally or regionally in the United States. The Federal Government was also ready for the year . Two weeks before the new year, . percent of the government's more than , mission-critical systems were Y K ready. The result was that while it has been noted there have been some glitches, thus far Y K issues have not affected the major government services and benefits provided to the American people. Internationally, after a slow start, countries made a concerted effort to ensure that critical issues would be ready for the date change and, as a general matter, major infrastructure systems abroad functioned smoothly during the rollover. There is general agreement that the Y K transition went more smoothly than any of us would have imagined. In fact, as noted in the week since the rollover, some people have suggested that Y K was an insignificant problem, hyped by the media, computer consultants and those with other reasons for hoping the world as we know it was about to end. The short answer is that I don't know of a single person working on Y K who thinks that they did not confront and avoid a major risk of systemic failure. Indeed, some of the noteworthy problems we have seen from difficulties at State motor vehicle offices to credit card processing problems to its Defense Department satellite system failure, proved that Y K was a very real threat indeed. While I do not think that the significance of the Y K problems was exaggerated, there were those who disagreed with our reports indicating that the problem was being successfully addressed. This form of hype can be traced to the skepticism and disbelief in some quarters that companies or governments reporting on their own progress could be telling the truth. In the United States, I kept reminding my doomsayer friends that it made no sense to discount these reports, since everyone who was in a position of responsibility would be easily found after January . Many continued to assume the worst would materialize, some now discounting the significance of the Y K threat point to the relative lack of major disruptions abroad. How did countries that appeared to have spent so little and were thought to be relatively unprepared emerge unscathed? Here, I think, there were a number of factors at work. Chief among them was the difficulty of getting accurate status reports, especially internationally on a fast-moving issue such as Y K. Information months old was out-of-date. But in the absence of additional details, people often relied on that older information, and then were surprised when it turned out to have been overtaken by subsequent progress. Additionally, once you get beyond the world's largest users of information technology, countries like the United States, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom, the reliance upon information technology drops off quickly. Furthermore, the technology being used in other countries is more likely to be off the shelf and not customized applications that are more difficult to fix. Finally, countries starting later had the benefits of the lessons learned by those working on Y K for several years. We spent a lot of time in the last months encouraging the sharing of technical information about problems, products, fixes and testing techniques, and I think it is obvious that worked paid off. So what lessons can we draw from the Y K experience? First, Y K has taught us that top management needs to be more involved in information technology on an ongoing basis, since information technology cuts to the very heart of how organizations conduct their business. In many companies, it was only when the board of directors or the chief executive officer took ownership of the problem that we could see the first signs of any real progress. Y K has also shown us that we need to do a better job of configuration management, in other words, keeping track of the technology we use and the functions it performs. Y K provided many large firms a reason to conduct, for the first time ever, a comprehensive inventory of their information technology infrastructure and processes. Not surprisingly, organizations found that some systems could be discarded without any loss in productivity. Other systems were replaced by newer, more efficient models. Third, Y K has demonstrated the value of forming partnerships across traditional boundaries to achieve a common goal. In addition to showing us the increasing interconnectedness of organizations through technology, Y K highlighted the fact that private industry and government can work together to address major national issues. I think that spirit of partnership obviously extended to the political arena as well. Most people realized early on there was not a Democratic or Republican solution to this problem, and we really have worked well together, particularly in the partnership that led to the passage of the Year Information Readiness and Disclosure Act in . Finally, I think that Y K has demonstrated that we need to include the American public in the discussions about any future large-scale challenges. Given the facts, whatever they are, people generally responded appropriately. Even when industry and government information provided to the public revealed that there was still substantial work left to do, people were reassured rather than alarmed. They seemed comforted to know their organizations were treating the problem seriously, were working together to solve it, and would keep them informed with the status of the situation. The President's Council will soon cease its operations. Before we post the going-out-of-business sign, we will focus on monitoring activities during the leap year rollover. We do not expect any major national problems and we anticipate the Council will shut down for good by the end of March. In closing, I would like to echo the comments made that the Federal Government and the country's successful resolution of the Y K problem attributes to the skill, dedication and hard work of thousands of professionals that have focused on this issue. It has been my pleasure to assist them as part of this vital national effort, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have at the conclusion of the other statements. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Koskinen follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Horn. We will go down, as you know, with this panel and then open it up to questions, because I think some of the information will jibe and some won't. The gentleman from the General Accounting Office, Mr. Joel Willemssen, the Director of Civil Agencies Information Systems, Accounting and Information Management Division. Mr. Willemssen has gone all over the United States with the subcommittee on government management and has been an active participant in the various panels we have had of government officials, private sector and so on. So it is a pleasure to have you here. I know you were working right up to midnight there, as I saw you in John's command center. So we appreciate all you have done and your team at the General Accounting Office. Mr. Willemssen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Chairwoman Morella, Ranking Member Turner, members of the subcommittees, thank you for inviting us to testify today. As requested, I will summarize our statement. Overall, during the rollover period, our country had relatively few Y K-related errors that affected the delivery of key services. While the Y K challenge is not yet over, because some key business processes have not yet been fully executed and some risky dates remain, the Nation's success thus far is a very positive indicator that these hurdles will also be overcome. The leadership exhibited by the legislative and the executive branches and the partnerships formed by numerous organizations were pivotal factors behind the success. The Y K-related errors that were experienced during the rollover generally did not affect the delivery of key services because they were either corrected quickly or contingency plans were implemented. A key reason that Y K errors had little effect on the delivery of services is that Federal agencies and other organizations used the rollover weekend to identify and correct errors before the problems resulted in operational consequences. In the Federal Government, the few Y K disruptions that were significant were mitigated by quick action. For example, the Department of Defense, Health Care Financing Administration and Federal Aviation Administration each experienced significant Y K events that they were able to address quickly. For high impact State-administered problems such as Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance, actions by States and the Federal Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Labor have paid off. Errors reported were often cosmetic printing or display problems with few failures resulting in disruptions to service. The threat posed by Y K was a much needed wake-up call for organizations to improve their management of information technology. Y K has laid a foundation for longer term improvements in the way that Federal Government manages information technology. I would like to quickly summarize some of the key lessons that we have learned out of the Y K experience. First, as mentioned, one of the most important factors underpinning the success of Y K was leadership at the highest levels of government. In particular, congressional oversight played a central role in pushing agencies forward on Y K. Mr. Koskinen and the President's Y K Council provided strong effective leadership. Second, Y K served as a notice to many on how much we rely on information technology to deliver key services. Third, there was standard guidance that was put together that was universally accepted, adopted and implemented, which facilitated Y K efforts and oversight. Such guidance provided consistency, imposed structure and discipline and enhanced the rigor of testing and assessment efforts. Fourth, as Mr. Koskinen mentioned, the establishment of partnerships among various organizations was especially important. In particular, the partnerships formed by Mr. Koskinen, Federal agencies and private sector organizations were instrumental to the Nation's Y K efforts. Fifth, we found that using standard techniques and metrics to monitor performance was especially helpful in measuring progress and remaining challenges. Finally, Y K saw many agencies take charge of their information technology resources in much more active ways. In many instances, it forced agencies to inventory their systems and to link those systems to agencies' core business processes. Also the development and testing of contingency plans should have benefits way beyond Y K. Further, Y K prompted agencies to establish needed policies in areas such as configuration management, risk management and software testing. In summary, the Y K rollover was clearly a success for our Nation. A key challenge now for the Federal Government is ensuring that the lessons learned in addressing Y K can be effectively used to improve overall information technology management. That concludes the summary of my statement. Thank you very much. Mr. Horn. I thank you very much. We have a lot to pursue in your very fine document here as to what did go wrong.

It is always a pleasure to have the Commissioner of Internal Revenue here. We will see you again on April th. We would love to hear your statement, because you had a lot of burdens counting on it, people that wanted refunds and all the rest of it. So thank you, Commissioner, for being here. Mr. Rossotti. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good to be here. Madam Chairman and distinguished Members, I am very pleased to report that the IRS experienced a smooth Y K rollover starting on December th and continuing up to the present with fewer problems this January than we normally experience in a normal January. To date, we have had good success. It was hard work and our success can be attributed to the comprehensive planning and preparations we have conducted over the last \ / \ years. We also are very grateful for the guidance and assistance you provided, your committee, as well as Mr. Koskinen and GAO. I do want to note we cannot yet declare total victory on Y K at the IRS. Some risks do remain, and in particular, we have to be very vigilant about Y K problems that could still crop up during our high volume tax filing season, which really starts in February and continues through April. As I discussed in previous hearings, the scope of the Y K problem at the IRS was enormous and required a significant investment, about $ . billion, to plan and prepare. But fortunately, that investment was made. Had we not adequately prepared for Y K, I think it is fair to say the tax system of the United States would simply have ground to a halt. In my written testimony, I described several scenarios for today, I picked out a few of the events that would have occurred. For example, our -year-old system for entering data from paper tax returns would have stopped working if we had simply allowed it to roll over without modification. This particular combination of hardware, software and third-party products could not be renovated, and therefore, was totally redesigned and replaced during and . Without this system, about million individual income tax returns that come in on paper would have just been piling up right now. Second, interest and penalty calculations would have been incorrect and would have generated wrong notices to taxpayers. For example, if we had not replaced the system, we would have sent about million wrong notices to taxpayers telling them that they owe money to the IRS. Those numbers would have been wrong. Third, our data transfers with important external organizations such as the financial management service and the Federal Reserve Bank would have failed because of incompatible dates. This would have impaired or eliminated the ability to issue about million refunds. Just a final example, I think this is particularly interesting, and certainly not unexpected, but after years of fixing and testing these systems, we did one final end-to-end test that was completed about the middle of December. This particular final end-to-end test identified problems. Some of those would have been very serious had we not fixed them at the end. For example, a system that generates new balance notices to taxpayers for certain tax periods was displaying the date as instead of for some of those notices. So if this problem had not been fixed, we would have been sending out hundreds of thousands of notices to taxpayers with incorrect tax periods and wrong payment dates that would have generated mass confusion among those taxpayers, and this was just only one example. There are many more scenarios in my written testimony. Of course, none of these things actually did happen, and that was simply because we acted in time to solve the problems. Now, the question is sometimes asked in the form of was Y K a blessing in disguise? I would have to say that I would not consider it to have been a blessing, whether it was disguised or not disguised, but there are some important residual benefits in the IRS that we will realize from the investment. I will mention the four most important. The first is we did replace a lot of obsolete hardware and system software products. As a result of the Y K program, most of our hardware in the IRS has been replaced, since most of it was really obsolete, and software releases have been brought up-to-date. This bringing up-to-date of this infrastructure is essential for supporting what we are now embarked on, our technology modernization program, and, of course, it is imperative that we have adequate annual replacements of hardware and regular routine upgrades of software releases in order to keep this vast installed base up-to-date. Second, we did implement some very important improvements in our program management practices. Our Y K program was successful largely because effective program management practices were implemented over the last years. These practices will be extremely valuable as we now move forward with our technology modernization program. I do want to note as challenging as Y K was, our modernization program imposes even more and different challenges because it involves major business changes as well as technology. Third, we were able to standardize many products. The IRS- installed base of hardware and software was not only obsolete, it was heterogeneous in the extreme. The Y K program has allowed us to set up and largely implement standard products. Because of our reorganization under the leadership of our CIO, Paul Cosgrave, we now have the management structure and delegated authority in place to make design and procurement decisions to maintain standardization of technology. Finally, we implemented improved inventory management. GAO has justly criticized the IRS for years for the poor condition of our IT inventory. Because of Y K, we were forced to examine our inventory and bring it up-to-date as never before. So the condition of our inventory records is greatly improved, although I have to note it is still not fully where it needs to be, and there is much that needs to be done in the future on that problem. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, we are gratified with our results. I stress there are still some risks that remain. Clearly, we gained some residual benefits which will be of great value as we proceed to our even more challenging business system modernization programs. These benefits will only be realized if we actively continue the practices established during Y K, including regular replacement and upgrades of hardware and software. We will keep the subcommittees apprised of any remaining problems and our actions to correct them. I thank you for the opportunity to discuss our efforts, and certainly thank you for your interest and support over the last years. Mr. Horn. Well, we thank you very much.

As Mr. Koskinen leaves the scene, there is no question in my mind the toughest job in the executive branch is the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. If anybody is going to turn that agency around, you are. So, thank you. The last witness on this panel is Mr. Fernando Burbano, the Chief Information Officer of the Department of State. We are glad to have you here. Mr. Burbano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Madam Chairwoman and distinguished members of both committees. Since my oral testimony is limited to minutes, my written testimony includes more detail. As chairman of the CIO Council Subcommittee on Critical Infrastructure Protection, I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss how lessons learned, products and processes developed in support of Y K, can be leveraged into our ongoing critical infrastructure security efforts and challenges facing Federal agencies in implementing security pleasures. As well, in my role as CIO of the State Department, I would like to thank you for providing me this opportunity to talk about the results and continuing impacts of the Department's successful Y K preparation efforts. The Department of State, along with rest of the Federal Government, showed just how powerful and effective we can be when we are singularly focused and committed to solving a problem and are provided the necessary resources to get the job done. First, let me quickly address the cost of preparing for Y K. The question is, did we spend too much? The answer is very simple: Absolutely not. We should be careful not to confuse the lack of catastrophic disruptions with unnecessary preparations by the Federal Government. Now, moving on to the actual results of the Y K rollover and its impacts to the global community. In general, there are few and only minor Y K failures reported internationally, and none that impacted the safety of American citizens worldwide. I believe this global success is a direct result of the U.S. Government's international outreach and awareness campaign led by the Department of State, the Department of Defense and the President's Council on the Y K Conversion, in coordination with the United Nations and World Bank. Embassies representing the U.S. presence in over countries around the world played a key role in monitoring and reporting events in their host countries and post facilities through a Y K task force convened in State's operations center. Additionally, internal State Department systems fared exceptionally well throughout the rollover, experiencing no significant failures among our mission critical, critical and routine systems. As you are well aware, many of the products and processes developed to address Y K problems can be applied to future challenges and serve as the foundation for managing issues with cross-agency and public-private boundaries, including critical infrastructure protection. In fact, much of the work already done is a prerequisite for PDD , critical infrastructure protection, Clinger-Cohen, and other government performance results act initiatives. Specifically, Y K preparation forced government agencies to take a close look at its IT applications and produce a complete prioritized inventory. This is a critical first step to identifying and refining the mission essential infrastructure as required by PDD . The Y K effort produced program management methodologies which were applied across all government agencies and included executive and congressional oversight, Assistant Secretary level management and repeatable standardized measures and processes. This management structure can also be applied to critical infrastructure protection. All elements of the Federal Government reviewed and developed contingency plans for critical business processes. The development of these contingency plans resulted in a greater understanding by senior policy managers of the dependency of business processes on IT systems. Additionally, these plans are durable beyond Y K established a foundation for all future contingency operations planning. For the Y K rollover period, the government developed a robust global reporting structural which can be leveraged into a mechanism for monitoring threats against critical infrastructure elements. For example, within the Department of State, we have developed a web-based geographic information system to collect cyber-threat information from all overseas posts. This tool can serve as a pilot system for other agencies to collect and analyze cyber-threat data. Finally, Y K preparation efforts increased the level of interagency cooperation and coordination between the public and private sectors. The same working level teamwork will be required to effectively implement critical infrastructure protection plans. There are two areas which I believe allow the Federal Government to successfully overcome widespread Y K problems in the face of an unmovable tight deadline. First, continued participation by key congressional oversight organizations provided Federal Y K programs the authority needed to push agency resources to their limits. Second, the ability of Federal Y K programs to rapidly obtain and more importantly retain adequate separate supplemental funding, specifically designated for Y K, allowed each agency to acquire the resources necessary to achieve the time sensitive objectives. This ability of Federal agencies to have access to a congressionally managed yet continuous separate supplemental funding stream designated specifically for the Y K effort allowed Federal CIOs and Y K program managers the ability to acquire and retain qualified resources in the needed quantity. Critical infrastructure protection requires the same approach. Involvement by Congress and other oversight organizations to raise the level of awareness and visibility throughout the Federal community and overseas CIP implementation in support of national security goals is vital, and this activity is already underway. But just as important to me and my colleagues through our government is access to funding which allows each of us to begin developing and implementing our plans in accordance with PDD and other critical infrastructure protection guidance and statutes. One of the key obstacles preventing agencies from immediately pursuing CIP initiatives is the lack of current funding for these projects. Due to the Federal Government's budget cycle, forecasting the future work is done years prior to the budget year. Therefore, as new requirements are levied, current agency budgets do not reflect changing priorities and requirements, such as the need for critical infrastructure protection implementation initiative. In light of this, there are numerous events that have prevented agencies from adequately addressing current CIP implementation requirements in their fiscal year and fiscal year budgets. First, the unprecedented and unpredictable growth of Internet use and technologies over the last years; second, the corresponding collateral growth of the cyber underworld during this same period; third, the extent to which our daily business relies on Internet-based systems and the fundamental shift of business tools to be used in a web-based environment; finally, expanding CIP requirements on Federal agencies, including the recent critical infrastructure plan released and its programs, some of which require immediate implementation. These are just some of the reasons why Federal agencies are poorly positioned to successfully implement critical infrastructure to address the challenge posed by the ever- growing cyber underworld, not to mention to be in compliance with executive guidance. Although we of the CIO council fully understand fiscal constraints, reallocation of such a fraction of the current surplus would be a solid investment for the protection of the Federal Government's critical infrastructure. In closing, it is my belief and the belief of members of my subcommittee and CIO's across the Federal Government that in order for the national CIP initiatives to be fully successful, continued congressional support as well as the ability to get access to specific CIP and security-related funding is vital. I cannot emphasize that without congressional-backed support, including adequate funding, we on the subcommittee of the critical infrastructure committee believe that the government will significantly fall short of national critical infrastructure protection goals. Thank you. Mr. Horn. We thank you very much for that statement. [The prepared statement of Mr. Burbano follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mr. Horn. We are sure there will be questions for every witness. I am going to start with the cochairman of the task force, the gentlewoman from Maryland, to begin the questioning. It will be limited to minutes by each Member, and it will alternate between those who have not had a chance, starting with Mr. Turner after the gentlewoman from Maryland. Mrs. Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I hear from all of you some of the same results assessments. First of all, you became more familiar in your various agencies, departments, groups with whom you work, with information technology and its role in the future. Second, there was an assessment of the systems that you have, so you are ready to move ahead with information technology. Also, I think, rising to the forefront is the concept of the partnerships, partnerships within the Federal Government, the executive branch, legislative branch, but also partnerships with the private sector, partnerships with local governments. I think that is something that we could all learn from and hope to continue to preserve. We also--I think you all said you felt this was very important and that it did prevent some big problems. My two questions I am going to meld into one because of the time constraints. First of all, I am surprised myself that there weren't some problems with the Pakistans of this world, Russia. They didn't seem to have any major problems. These are places with older computer systems. I just wondered if you all were surprised at the lack of the problems we have heard about emanating from those countries and other countries that would be in the same category? Second part, as we look to leap year, February th, do you foresee any major or minor problems? Is there something we should be doing about that? I guess I could start then with Chairman Koskinen. Mr. Koskinen. Well, as I noted in my testimony, I think things did go better abroad than anyone had expected. Partially, though, I think that is because we fell prey to what I thought people did here, which is we didn't believe other countries when they gave us their progress reports. In the last months of the year, country after country issued reports that didn't say there wasn't a problem, but basically said they identified the places where they needed to apply resources; they had done that effectively and they were prepared. We all sort of said it was late in the day, are they really prepared? It turned out they were, for a number of reasons that I discussed. One is, a lot of them had much less reliance on information technology, certainly in their infrastructure, than we do here. In fact, I think there are a relatively small number of countries in the world that have complicated computerized control systems for their infrastructure that put them at risk. So a lot of countries discovered that the embedded-chips did not create a problem for their infrastructure. In fact, in the last quarter of last year, we noted, based on testimony and information from industry experts, that it was unlikely that the lights would go out anywhere or that a dial tone would stop anywhere, that the risk in infrastructure systems with embedded systems was gradual degradation of service over a period of time. So in the countries that we knew were in the middle--the truly developing countries have very little IT and were at risk primarily in financial systems, it was the Pakistans, Indonesias, Russias, Chinas of the world--that had a reasonable reliance on information technology, where people were concerned about how much they had done. I think it is a combination of the fact that they started late, but they spent a lot of time in the last to months working hard on it. They got the benefit of learning from everybody else. There was a tremendous amount of information exchanged as we moved through it, and third, a lot of their systems are still analog, they are not digital. They did not depend upon new digitalized equipment, and therefore, they were able to prioritize their resources in a much more focused way. But I would emphasize that the image of those countries, as if they didn't do anything, they were unconcerned and just waited around, was wrong. We met with country delegates in June at the United Nations, and every one of those countries understood this was a problem that, in some degree, affected them. Every one of those countries was then focused on Y K, every country met at least twice in every region of the world cooperating, or most of the countries did, cooperating, sharing information. So I think what happened was in that last months far more work was done in a very focused, effective way than any of us were able to get a window on. With regard to February th, it has turned out in testing, certainly in the Federal systems and in the private sector, that there have been more mistakes than one would have thought. You would have thought people would have gotten the right result for the wrong reason, which is, they didn't understand the rule of centuries, they just divided by and figured out the year was a leap year. It turned out there were a reasonable number of programmers that had just enough information to be dangerous, which is, they knew centuries generally aren't leap years, they just didn't know the rule of the exception divisible by . So this is primarily a software problem, although there were some potential embedded chip and system operations problems. Our judgment is we will see no more glitches than we saw on January , which were relatively minor and modest. We are going to monitor it for two reasons. One is we think it is important for those who are operating systems to understand it is a real problem and there is still time for them to test their systems. Most major companies have already done that. Second, it will be important to monitor the days: the th, th and st of March, so the glitches that occur, and I think inevitably there will be some, are put in the appropriate context. If we had not been able to identify the limited nature of the glitches as they occurred over that first or days on the rollover, we would have had a very different media response. When reports came in of legitimate glitches, the fact, we were able to confirm their accuracy, but expand by saying that is the only country in which it happened, or the only area that happened. It allowed us to put the glitch in the right context. Absent that, you would have had a greater likelihood of unnecessary overreaction by either the media or the public. We don't expect there will be many glitches, but we think it is important for the public to know where they are and what their significance is. Mrs. Morella. I would like to give you opportunity to respond, Mr. Burbano. Incidentally, I love that acronym for the critical infrastructure, CIAO. It is easy to remember. Mr. Burbano. Thank you. Working at the State Department, I had a great opportunity to actually go overseas to many of the countries and meet the John Koskinens of those countries and their sector leaders. I found two things quite interesting, and that is why I personally wasn't too surprised. One is in talking to them, I found out they were not as automated as some of the people thought they were. But more importantly, the culture in a lot of these countries is not to report the status of government systems, whether it is good or bad, believe it or not. But they will reveal more orally, which obviously when you try to track status, is the only thing that are looked at is written, and if you don't have information to provide, you assume the worst, and that is why they don't get reported as well. Those were the two reasons I found. Mrs. Morella. Like people say about the President, underestimate so that the results will be attributed to you, however it comes out. Mr. Horn. I thank the gentlewoman. I now yield to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Turner, the ranking member, minutes for questioning. Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Koskinen, I don't know if you have this information or are set up to collect it, but earlier we had a lot of dire predictions about lawsuits being filed all over the place regarding Y K problems, and I would be curious as to whether or not any of that has occurred and the degree to which that was a significance problem? Mr. Koskinen. Well, some of us maintained last year that you couldn't have massive lawsuits without having massive failures, and therefore, at least the President Council's position was there was not likely to be this flood of litigation, because there was not likely to be a flood of failures. That turns out to have been correct. There have been a relatively modest number, but significant lawsuits have been filed where people are arguing about who is going to pay for the fixes, and the question is whether insurance policies cover the failures that companies avoided, particularly in major companies in the United States. But as a general matter, in the absence of any very significant Y K failures since the st of the year, obviously, you can't have a lawsuit if you don't have somebody damaged in some way. So at this juncture, the only lawsuits out there are primarily focused on arguments between those who fixed the systems and primarily their insurance companies about who ought to pay for it. Even that is not anything like a flood of litigation. Mr. Turner. As I recall, of those issues that you mentioned regarding who should pay for fixing, it was not the subject of the litigation nor the success of the legislation that attracted so much attention in the Congress, because all issues were separate and aside from the issues that were dealt with in the Y K litigation. Mr. Koskinen. That is right. The legislation that the Congress passed primarily addressed the rights and responsibilities of potential plaintiffs and defendants if there were system failures, focused primarily on giving potential defendants the opportunity and the right to fix any of those failures within a defined period of time, and again, since there have been relatively few of those problems that amounted to much, there have been a lot of glitches along the way, there hasn't been much need for the legislation. But I am sure people would argue that since there were great risks, if we didn't get the work done, that there would be failures, there was some potential that the failures obviously would have generated litigation. The fact that we haven't had the failures has had the side effect that we are not going to much litigation. Mr. Turner. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. We are in the question period. Does the gentlewoman from Illinois have some questions? The gentlewoman is recognized for minutes. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you. As far as what is going to happen in the future, will there be a plan like continuation of your Council, or is there going to be an office that will remain after probably the leap year? Mr. Koskinen. Well, if there is, it won't have me in it. No, the Council will, as I noted, fold up its tent and fade away into the dusk, probably by the end of March. The issue going forward that Mr. Burbano noted that people are focused on is how will we deal with information technology security and threats to the critical infrastructure, and there is a Presidential decision directive, PDD , that sets out a structure and an organizational framework for dealing with those issues, coordinated by the National Security Council out of the White House. So that operation, while we have been coordinating very closely together over the last years, will continue, but it is already set up in the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Organization [CIAO], as Chairwoman Morella noted, and that will be separate from the President's Council. Mrs. Biggert. So there will no longer be a CIO czar? Mr. Koskinen. That is right. I never saw myself as the CIO czar. The CIOs actually have been very capable of taking care of themselves. Mrs. Biggert. Again to Mr. Koskinen, what was the biggest surprise of the rollover? Mr. Koskinen. Well, if you look back at our quarterly assessments, we did four of those. In the last one we put out in the fall, basically in the United States the rollover went as we predicted. We said there were going to be no national infrastructure failures, there would be no regional failures, if there were any failures, there would be isolated problems at the local level. That is what we basically have seen. So in the United States we have been pleased that there haven't been more visible problems for small businesses. A number of them have had glitches, but they seem to have been able to deal with those, because that was an area we were concerned about. So, like others, I think the bigger area of uncertainty for us was what was going to happen abroad. Again, we did not think as we noted in our report and in a report by the Department of Commerce that any glitches abroad would have any significant or noticeable impact on the American economy. We looked at the range of possibilities, where the countries were that were at risk, and where our trade and business partners were, and it was clear to us, no matter what happened in the countries we thought were at risk, it was not going to have an economic impact on us. That also turned out to be true. But as we discussed earlier, I think all of us were, primarily for a lack of information, concerned about a number of countries that rely on some information technology who started late, where it was hard to know exactly how much work they had gotten done in the last to months of . It turned out that in their basic infrastructure, I think primarily because it was not as much at risk as we might have suspected, there haven't been any infrastructure failures. The other thing to bear in mind is in the areas where I think they were at greatest risk, which is in financial transactions and communications, those systems were being tested and worked on for the last years on an international basis. So even in a country that didn't have an organized process for infrastructure protection, its banking system had to be testing and working with other banking systems, because the central bankers around the world for the last years focused on that. That was, in many ways I think, the biggest risk they had and the biggest success they had. Mrs. Biggert. I guess just one last question, that so many valuable lessons came out of the experience, and how are we going to ensure that these lessons aren't lost if we don't continue on after leap year day, February th, I guess it is? Mr. Koskinen. We created in my prior incarnation, with the help of this committee and others, the Clinger-Cohen Act and the Chief Information Officers Council and CIOs in all of the agencies, with the idea they would be as they have been the focus for information technology issues across the government. That council is chaired by my successor as the Deputy Director for Management at OMB, and independent of the information technology issues, the security issues that are under the critical infrastructure assurance organization, but focused on by the CIOs as well, there is an existing vehicle that I think, over the last years of its existence, has turned out to be very effective for bringing together all of the Federal agencies and their senior information technology people to work together on isolating and identifying what are the critical challenges the Federal Government faces, how should we be organized to deal with those, and then implementing those situation suggestions. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. Let me ask you, Mr. Koskinen, you have had a lot of experience in the executive branch, first in OMB and other consultant operations, and, of course, this. You note in your formal statement here, and you mentioned it also, I believe, in your oral summary, this is the greatest management challenge the world has faced in the last years. I think there is probably a lot of truth to that on the world. But when we look at major management challenges within the executive branch over to years, we see the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb, major challenges of how you put that together; going to the moon is certainly another one, setting a goal as President Kennedy there; Admiral Rickover and the nuclear Navy, where you cut through a lot of bureaucracy and got the job done. I guess I would ask you, as you look here, how do Presidents best get served in dealing with those management problems and the one you just presided over? So give us a little insight into that. Mr. Koskinen. Well, as I say, I think the difference between the Y K problem and the other significant challenges you floated, which I think were important for the country is, this was a challenge that affected every system in the Federal Government, every agency. So it was not a question of having NASA or the Energy Department or someone else focusing on a very major challenge. This was a challenge of having every Federal agency, large and small, challenged at the same time, not only within each agency but across agency lines. The Treasury Department services and provides financial services to a wide range of Federal agencies, for example. I think in all of those cases, what is needed is for people to identify the problem and for it to have a high level of commitment and attention from the Congress as well as from the executive branch. Again, I think the structure set up of the CIO council for information technology challenges going forward is an effective structural vehicle for the government to be able to surface what the issues are and deal with them effectively. So as we move forward, I think information technology is not a series of episodic challenges for us. Information technology is an ongoing issue, not just for the Federal Government, but for the private sector and world as we become more reliant on information technology for everything from communication to financial transactions. Mr. Horn. What do you see based on usual experience as to the one or two management challenges after this is done? What do you see? You have had a real eye-opener, I think, throughout the last few years. Mr. Koskinen. Clearly information technology is a challenge. I think it has affected our ability to modernize systems across the government, to have them implemented and operate effectively, has been for some time and will continue to be a challenge. I think performance measurement. I was a great supporter of the Government Performance and Results Act. I think it is important, not only for effective management within the government, but for an improved dialog with the public about what our goals are and our objectives are and how we are doing and achieving those. So as we go forward, I think we have on our plate significant challenges, and we probably don't have to reach out and find new ones. If we could handle both of those effectively, deliver services more effectively under GPRA and provide improved updated modernized information technology delivery systems across the government, I think we are headed in the right direction in those areas, but I think they are major challenges. Mr. Horn. We are going to be holding hearings with the Government Management Subcommittee on Clinger-Cohen that was mentioned, which came out of this subcommittee and the full committee, and also on the computer security issue, which came up here, so we will be looking for you to testify on those things. Those certainly cut across different agencies within the executive branch. We have a whole other agenda also we can get into with whoever is in place there with the CIOs, because I think that is very important, what you did when you took the job and came out of retirement. You went around and sat down with the Deputy Secretaries who often operate the departments, and I think that was very important. Would you like anything else to have done that you didn't have time to do? Mr. Koskinen. No. Oddly enough, this was my feeling even before we had the successful transition, if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't do anything differently. We did all we needed to do, I think, and all we could do. I got tremendous cooperation from not only the leadership in all of the Federal agencies, but as I noted, I think a stunning achievement by career public servants in the Federal Government and State and local government, demonstrating an ability to meet a real challenge and meet it effectively. Mr. Horn. What are you going to do with that $ million headquarters? Who moves in? Mr. Koskinen. That includes the operational cost for a year, so not all of it will be in place. But OMB is working with the agencies and I have said that when we do our last briefing on March st for the rollover, OMB at that time will announce exactly what its plans are for the operational capacity at the information coordination center. Mr. Horn. Most Presidents early in the morning get a national security briefing coming over from CIA. Do any Presidents ever get a management briefing in the morning as to what is going on in the executive branch and why not? Mr. Koskinen. That is not in my jurisdiction at this point, so I can't tell you whether that is done or not. Mr. Horn. It was in part when you were Deputy Director for management. The question is most Presidents don't know what is going on in the executive branch unless there is some crisis that hits the papers. Shouldn't Presidents also be looking at the domestic situation, just as they look in the morning at the foreign situation? Mr. Koskinen. There is no doubt that our ability to manage the vast organizations we have and the significant funds that we have is an important part of our responsibility to the public, and I think that not just in the executive branch and the Congress as well, it is oftentimes more exciting to talk about new policies or new programs or failures isolated. It is much harder, as you know, in the leadership you have had in your subcommittee, to get people to understand and focus on day-in and day-out management. But when push comes to shove, our ability to make changes and provide benefits to people depends on our ability to manage programs effectively. Good ideas poorly implemented are actually very ineffective. Mr. Horn. I am going to yield now to Mr. Wu from Oregon for minutes of questioning. Mr. Wu. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am just going to use a little bit of my time and really focus on this a little bit more with the private sector panel coming up. I just want to ask one question: With the upgrades, the new equipment, the other preparation work which was done in the Federal agencies, do you see, or are you currently experiencing a dip in procurement as a result of the bulge, if you will, prior to December st? Mr. Koskinen. I think the agencies can probably answer that question better. Mr. Burbano. I would like to address that as the CIO for the State Department. I would say not really, for this reason. There was a lot of systems, and I know at the State Department we put a moratorium on systems development and implementation and so forth if it wasn't Y K-related. So all of that was put on the shelf, and now it is getting off-the-shelf as soon as the leap year is over. So that is going to offset. Mr. Rossotti. With respect to the IRS what really happened is that over a to -year period, we made an investment to bring up-to-date our hardware and operating system software. But, for example, with PCs, personal computers, we really need to be on about a -year replacement cycle there, so we are replacing each year about one-third of the computers representing what was installed years ago. That is kind of the way that we are planning it. There will be some dropoff in a few areas where we had to make some special investments, but, on the whole, what we really want to do is get on a long-range planning basis where we invest a certain amount every year so that we don't get behind as badly as we were years ago. Mr. Wu. And with respect to personnel, the people you brought aboard, whether on a long-term basis or on a contract basis to help you with the Y K problem, are they being redeployed within your agencies, have they left? What is going on with the people? Mr. Rossotti. Speaking for myself and the IRS, what we have done is we simply made a determined effort years ago to retain the people we had. Unfortunately, we were suffering attrition. So we made some very successful efforts to retain the people we had, the people who really know some of these old software systems, and simply had to put many, many other things on hold. We even had to go to the Congress when they passed the Restructuring Reform Act, and ask that some of the effective dates for the law be extended out to , because there was no way to implement some of the things while still working on the fixes. So what we did was we simply took our staff, tried to retain it, and allocated it to fixing Y K as the top priority, putting other things on hold. What we are now doing is trying to dig out from this huge backlog. Furthermore, we are in an unusual position in that we are now just embarking on an enormous technology modernization program. What IRS has right now is we have relatively new hardware in most cases, and relatively up-to-date operating systems, such as your Windows-type operating systems and your mainframe operating systems. What we don't have is up-to-date application software. We have, in fact, extremely obsolete applications software, and we have a lot of it. So our role now over the next several years is with the help of a prime contractor is to reengineer that technology, and as I mentioned in my opening statement, that involves business change as well as technology change. So you could almost think of Y K as just laying the groundwork for what we really have to do over the next several years to reengineer our applications. Mr. Burbano. From my view at the State Department, with the new Y K initiative, if you want to call it the critical infrastructure protection I have been talking about, there is going to be a huge demand for new people with possibly different skills for computer security, cyber terrorism and so forth. So there will be a replacement. Some of the skills used in Y K can certainly be applied. Others, maybe not. So you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. Regardless, there is going to be a huge demand for this new initiative that is facing us that is very serious. Mr. Wu. On net, do you think you are adding folks in the hardware-software information systems area, or are you shedding a few now in the State Department? Mr. Burbano. I think it is a combination. Not with employees, with contractors. It is a combination of shifting, replacement of skills, keeping some. But don't forget, we are still not out of the Y K window until the rollover of the leap year. So that is a little bit too early to say right now. But we are starting to look at it in that view, that since we do have this new huge initiative that is very important and will go on for the unforeseeable future, there will be a replacement of skills, and some of those will be applicable and some not. Mr. Wu. I thank the witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Horn. The gentleman from Washington, Mr. Baird, minutes. Mr. Baird. No questions. Mr. Horn. Mrs. Biggert, the gentlewoman from Illinois. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you. In making the fixes on the computers, organizations really used a lot of different methods, and some, apparently, I think what we heard before were like short-term fixes as far as the date change of windowing, making the dates like and rather than or . Will there be any oversight or will organizations, do you think, pursue a permanent change, or will these temporary changes or fixes really last for the long time, or will there have to be something done there? Is there any oversight, I guess, is the question or do they need to--do you know of organizations that will need to pursue the permanent fix? Maybe Mr. Willemssen. And one other thing, I think, like HCFA delayed putting in a new system until this was over. Do you see that the Y K will have benefited how for them to pursue that, the new changes in their systems? Mr. Willemssen. First of all, you are correct, many organizations had to use techniques such as windowing, because in many instances they had no choice. There wasn't enough time to go through a full date expansion of the software and data bases. So many of them did use those kind of techniques. They will not last forever. Many of those same organizations plan to have new systems over the next few years, so that the risk, if those new systems come in, is relatively small. However, the caveat to that is when programmers put in digits in the 's and 's, they thought their systems also would be replaced, and many of them were not. So there still has to be some oversight of that issue. I would say it is very difficult, though, to generalize among agencies because even within a specific agency business function, some may have windowed, some may have gotten a new system, while others may have fully expanded the date field. It is therefore, an issue where you have to go in and do a full examination and know what you are dealing with and be aware of where your risk points are as time continues with these kind of patched systems. Mr. Burbano. I would like to say that at the State Department, since the Y K program office was run underneath the CIO, which is remaining, we do track where we used windowing. We used a combination of windowing repairs as well as replacements. We do have a list of those. We are tracking them, and most of those are years or more out. But we do have a list of those and we will track them so long as the CIO office lasts. Mrs. Biggert. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Thank you. Now the cochairman of this task force, Mrs. Morella, the gentlewoman from Maryland. Mrs. Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A question for Mr. Willemssen. GAO recently reported that some of the Y K remediation that was done at Federal agencies was contracted out to private corporations, and in your report, you noted that some of the private companies used non-U.S. citizens to work out the remediation. I just wondered if you would comment for the record on what you found and what you think implications are, if any? Mr. Willemssen. We did have a request from the full House Science Committee to look at the use of foreign nationals at the Federal Aviation Administration in both the remediation of software and in the post-remediation review of software that had been previously remediated, and we did find some oversights on the part of FAA. To the FAA administrator's credit, she aggressively took action on these oversights, and they are now in the process of going out and making sure that all of the individuals who worked on the code are indeed checked out. FAA did not know for sure, for all of the systems that were remediated and reviewed, that the individuals had an appropriate background investigation, and therefore whether the risk was manageable in terms of manipulating the code. So there were some issues that we did find. Again, to FAA's credit, they have been very aggressive in following up on these issues. One of the issues I think you pointed out at one of the prior hearings, was that there was a security risk involved to the extent that it wasn't managed with all of this push to get Y K done. That it would be done quickly, losing sight of some of the necessary controls, and that is in fact, what happened here at FAA. All the controls were not in place to check out all of the individuals working on the code. Mrs. Morella. Do you feel comfortable that this has then become a symbol for what could happen if you don't have proper implementation of the regulations and that the agencies all know this? Did we learn from it, besides the FAA immediately saying we will correct the oversight? Mr. Willemssen. I hesitate to generalize because FAA is the only agency where we went into depth on this particular point, so I hesitate to say that other agencies may have similar issues, although I know the executive branch is looking into that. I know that, as I mentioned, FAA has been very aggressive and actually we are expecting a more detailed report from FAA within the next couple of days on all of their actions in response to a recommendation to do the background checks on individuals working on the code. Mrs. Morella. I think you would like to comment on that. Mr. Burbano. Yes. The State Department, we looked at this issue very carefully at the beginning. First of all, domestically, we did not use any foreigners, especially that is where mission critical systems are. We do require, regardless, we do require all of our contractors and employees to go through secret clearances. In addition to that, some minor systems overseas did have some FSNs, foreign service nationals, working on their systems, but they were closely supervised by the Americans at the Embassies, and we have had no problem at all. Everybody goes through a clearance check anyway. Mrs. Morella. Splendid. Thanks for that assurance. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. Let me ask a few questions here in closing with this panel. I would like the commissioner and Mr. Koskinen to respond to this. The question would be the extent to which windowing was used to repair systems, and is that really a permanent situation, or how do you feel about the windowing aspect where you are trying to piece it altogether and fool it, shall we say, in terms of the computers? Mr. Koskinen. I don't think anybody has the capacity to tell you how much of the work was done by windowing and how much was date expansion. Windowing is a technique that is effective as long as you don't care about when people were born or transactions in those windows. In other words, if you really are only worried about relative dates, you can window. But in things like Social Security, you can't window very effectively, because you care very much about whether or not somebody has been born on one side of the window or another. Second, I think the point Mr. Willemssen made is important, and that is, when we talk about configuration management and better control of IT systems, obviously monitoring the way we fix systems for Y K as we go forward is an important part of that management, and I think it is exactly right to note that years ago, years ago, people working on systems that knew they weren't going to be Y K compliant were comfortable because they thought those systems wouldn't be operating. So you have to be a little worried about anybody saying today, well, my windowing works until or , so I don't have a problem, because those dates will come before we know it. So I think the answer to that is not was it done, it clearly was done. It was a very effective technique, it was cost effective, and particularly if you are going to replace or upgrade those systems, it was probably the right way to go. It will turn out to be a mistake if you lose track of it, continue to run the systems through the window, and discover you have got a major challenge down the road. Mr. Rossotti. I am pleased to say in this case, one of the few occasions I can answer very easily, we did not use windowing at the IRS, we did everything with -date digit expansion and required a special exception from the CIO to have any exceptions, and, to my knowledge there were just maybe a very tiny handful, maybe one system given an exception. Interestingly, the reason for that decision was not primarily because of worries that would, you know, become obsolete in or years, but because we had so many heterogeneous systems that had to work together, we were not convinced that if we used some windowing here and some data expansion here, that we wouldn't run into incompatibilities among our own systems. So we made a decision to keep it simple, and so everything was made compliant by four-digit date expansion. Mr. Horn. OK. Now it has been mentioned on the foreign workers in some of the patching up of these systems, I would be curious how you all think how vulnerable our computer systems are as a result of the Y K, and are you concerned that those remediating systems could have engaged in acts contrary to the best interests of the government? So I would just appreciate-- let's start with Mr. Burbano. Mr. Burbano. Yes. In terms of the concern, you should always be concerned, but because of the process I mentioned that we took at State with requiring security clearances, all domestic systems, where our mission critical/critical systems are at, only used Americans. We don't have as much concern there. Overseas, again, I mentioned we did use FSNs who have to be cleared and who only work the minor systems and who are closely monitored by Americans when working on the systems. So we are not as concerned. However, we did develop a project in concert with my sister bureau, Diplomatic Security, on doing some spot checks on some of the systems, just to make sure. But, just to let you know, you know, even with commercially off-the-shelf systems, you don't know where those systems are developed. They could have foreigners working on those systems also. So you do have to be vigilant about these systems. Mr. Horn. Commissioner, in terms of computer security, I am sure you have to deal with that every day in some way. Mr. Rossotti. Well, we have, of course, major security challenges in the IRS from a number of perspectives, including from the old applications software. But I think on this particular issue, that is to say, the contractor support we used for the Y K, I think we were in pretty good shape on that. There was one particular component of one system that, for a particular reason, was developed with some offshore people, but that was then subsequently cross-checked by a different group that was cleared. So as far as I know, I think we can be pretty confident on this, we do not have much vulnerability for this particular problem. That is not the same thing as saying we don't have vulnerabilities for other reasons. Mr. Horn. Mr. Koskinen, why don't you give us your side of it? Mr. Koskinen. I think Mr. Burbano made the important point, which is, security is an issue beyond Y K, you ought to be very careful about whoever works on your systems. As a general matter, we were concerned about this issue from the start and we worked with the intelligence agencies and the National Security Council and others, both to warn private sector companies as well as domestic companies to be alert to this issue. Most of them in a large sense are. Most of the off-shore work was done by the private sector and not the government. Most government work was done by normal contracting, or internal resources, so that there was much less of that done here than in the private sector. Monitoring what has gone on in the private sector, what has gone on, we have seen very little, in fact, almost no evidence that work done offshore included some kind of security threat. Obviously, the absence of glitches over the rollover means at least if somebody was targeting the time to create mischief, that was not one of those times. But I think the bottom line to that is, again, as we move forward, information security has to be high on everybody's list. I think, again, the point is well made. It is not just people who have access to your system. It is when you buy systems, whether it is off-the-shelf systems or otherwise, you have to be worried about who worked on those systems, what is in them and what potential impact could they have on your own system. So I think if anything requires eternal vigilance, it will be, in fact, information security and security about those working on your systems. Mr. Horn. I thank you. We will be holding a separate hearing on the computer security anyhow, so we will postpone the rest of those questions. Mr. Willemssen, before we round out this panel, I would like you to summarize the following under of your formal statement, ``Reported Year -related Errors in the Federal Government.'' If you could just sort of bullet them to me in one sentence, each one, just so we have it in the record, I would appreciate it. Mr. Willemssen. On is a summary of what we observed during the rollover from both the perspective of the information coordination center and specific agencies where we were onsite. We tried to summarize what we thought seemed to be significant issues that did come up, even though they were addressed very quickly. Briefly, those included the Department of Defense intelligence satellite system, the Federal Aviation Administration had some systems with some Y K failures that again, they were able to remediate and fix very quickly, and the Health Care Financing Administration ran into some difficulties with partners. In one case HCFA had a problem with a bank on some electronic payments leading to some delays in payments, although it is still within the required targets. Also, HCFA will continue to work aggressively with their providers in making sure that they put forward accurate dates on their claims so that claims are not returned. Mr. Horn. You say here there are , claims from providers with these erroneous dates in the first week of the new year. Mr. Willemssen. That is why we thought it important to give a sense of the magnitude, because they are not just little things that we are talking about. They are little within the scope of the entire Medicare program, but they do have some impact. But, again, HCFA has done an outstanding job over the last couple of years on getting on top of Y K. They as much as anyone faced a mission impossible on Y K, and through the leadership of their administrator, again, they continue to be very aggressive in following up and making sure that the disruptions are kept to a minimum. Mr. Horn. And then the ones that concern most of us based on our air travel regularly is the low level wind shear alert system. Can you tell us anything about that? Mr. Willemssen. Again, those systems were out at about eight locations, but they were out for no more than hours, I think hours minutes at the outside. Fortunately, when they were out, we saw no evidence of bad weather in those locations. So we could be sure, based on the evidence we saw that there were no safety implications from those systems being out. Again, it speaks toward the advantage of all the agencies being poised to respond during the rollover. FAA was ready to get right on top of those systems and fix them immediately, and that they did, to their credit. Mr. Horn. Yes. I was spending part of that December st in the L.A. Tower, and I got a good education from the technicians there. They have a terrific job to do when they are getting those radar sites into operation when something goes crazy with them. I was very impressed by that group. So are there any other major things that is a worry to the General Accounting Office? Mr. Willemssen. I again conclude by saying the rollover was a great success, thanks to the leadership of Mr. Koskinen and yours and Chairwoman Morella's leadership. However, I think it is important that we continue to monitor events over the next couple of months. I would strongly concur with Mr. Koskinen's plan to bring up the ICC again during the leap year, because I think there will be a few disruptions that again occur, and I think there will also be a few disruptions that we start hearing about as processing cycles complete themselves. So we haven't heard the last of Y K. But I think it will be much, much less than what we had once feared. Mr. Horn. I want to end on a happy note here and help the Department of State a little, Mr. Burbano. In November , the Department of State submitted its regular quarterly report for the year to the Office of Management and Budget, and of course, that does come to our subcommittee. After a lot of discussion with you and OMB, it became clear that the language in that quarterly report didn't really accurately reflect the actual level of effort for the Department's independent verification and validation work. Just so we can give you an A on this, please explain to me the independent verification process that you actually went through but wasn't in the report. Mr. Burbano. Thank you very much. At the State Department, one of the things that I did when I came on board in May , as you all know, I came on board, we had straight F's for about a year, so I had to move quickly in order to especially meet the deadlines of Congress. But I wanted to make sure that we did it correctly and not get any surprises at the rollovers. So I set up a very rigorous process where not only did we have the separate bureaus test our systems, but underneath my office, the Y K office separate from their individual bureau Y K offices, I had independent contractors test the systems. That was the first level of independent tests. But in addition to that, I did a partnership with the Inspector General where they would do a second test with their own contractors to review the test and so forth, and certify the systems, along with myself as the CIO. So we went through two levels of independent verification tests, in addition to the testing that the Bureau did themselves. The misunderstanding that came in that, we were about percent in November or somewhere around that nature, in terms of certification, but when, in fact, it really equalled to about percent, because we had already finished our first level. That is where the misunderstanding came. I think we proved that right since we had really no significant--not only in the mission criticals, but in the criticals as well as the routines, this thoroughness that we did. Mr. Horn. Well, thank you very much. On that, are there any questions any Member has? If not, we appreciate what each of you has had to contribute to this and the fine work you have done that kept us going with very minor glitches. So thank you all for coming. We now go to panel two. Mr. Horn. I would ask you to stand and raise your right hands. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Horn. The reporter will note all three confirmed. Mrs. Morella will preside. Mrs. Morella [presiding]. Thank you. I want to thank the second panel for being so patient and waiting in going through the first panel testimony and the questions that were asked. So we will be concise. We know that you can offer a great deal to supplement what we learned about Y K. Proceeding again with the -minute rule, you can give us a synopsis of your testimony. We will start with, first of all, Mr. Harris Miller. I want to comment on the fact that from the very beginning Mr. Miller has been very tuned into this issue, has appeared before this committee probably as many times as any other person who has testified. So we very much appreciate his coming back now at the end as we do our summation and look ahead to the future. He is president of the Information Technology Association of America. Ms. Kathy Hotka has not appeared before this committee before, so you are the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. Ms. Hotka is vice president for technology at the National Retail Federation here in Washington, DC. We welcome you. Thank you. Mr. Gary Beach has appeared before this joint committee, and he is the publisher of CIO Communications, Inc., from Framingham, MA. Again, thank you for appearing here. Thank you for waiting. Let's start off with Mr. Miller. STATEMENTS OF HARRIS MILLER, PRESIDENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA; CATHY HOTKA, VICE PRESIDENT FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION; AND GARY BEACH, PUBLISHER, CIO COMMUNICATIONS, INC. Mr. Miller. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. It is said that politics makes strange bedfellows, but I found out that Y K makes strange bedfellows, for on the morning of January st, instead of being snuggled warm in my bed with my wife, I was instead with Chairman Horn at the C-SPAN studios doing a broadcast on Y K. What is even more unusual is that at a.m., constituents of his from California were calling in, which means at o'clock in the morning they were paying attention to what was going on with Y K. But I appreciated working with both of you chairmen and the members of your subcommittee. I am going to skip the victory lap you mentioned, Madam Chairwoman. It is my written statement and will be in record. I obviously want to commend the subcommittees, and particularly Mr. Koskinen, for his leadership. From the perspective of the private sector, we do believe this is a real crisis that we did face, it was not something that was hyped or made up. In fact, as I was walking down the hall this morning with our Y K program manager, Heidi Hooper is with me, she noted there wasn't a line about the hallway waiting to get into the subcommittee hearing. I said that is good news, because if, in fact, the problems had occurred, I suggest you wouldn't have Harris Miller and Kathy Hotka and Gary Beach on this panel, you would have Alan Greenspan and Secretary Summers discussing the global recession that had been caused. So, in fact, the fact we didn't have a major crisis is good news, and the fact we don't have hordes of people standing around is, in fact, very good news. In terms of the magnitude of the effort, I would certainly agree with Mr. Koskinen's effort. In fact, I even go a little more hyperbolic, I think it is the biggest success since the building of the pyramids, because it was, in fact, a global effort, government, private sector, hundreds of thousands of individuals around the globe working together to achieve this success. To talk about the lessons learned, I would like to refer to what I believe is a Y K renaissance. What do I mean by a Y K renaissance? I think it really is two parts. First of all, the rationalization of the existing computer technology. You heard a lot about this from the first panel in the Federal sector, but the same thing was true very much in the private sector. The fact that time and again, because of the necessity of dealing with this huge challenge, companies were able to get rid of deadwood programs, they were able to bring into their companies more modern and more efficient computer systems. They also learned to do supply chain analysis and in a systematic way that they had never done before. They were able to collaborate in ways never experienced before, either within companies or across companies. They were able to develop contingency plans, many of which were not needed as it turned out, at least are now in place should there be future problems, and they learned to approach the entire IT system in a much more strategic way. That is going to mean that down the road these companies and ultimately their customers can take much more benefit from information technology. The productive gains which Mr. Greenspan and others have noted have helped to contribute to the continued growth of our economy and the high productivity should be even stronger because the IT systems in companies as well as within the government are now being treated much more rationally and in a much more systematic way. The second reason I call this a Y K renaissance is the new directions that companies are now taking. Because as they came to understand through Y K the strategic as opposed to tactical importance of IT, they are now moving ahead implementing future IT much more strategically. Obviously, the Internet changes everything, and we are seeing throughout the private sector and we hope the government sector will quickly catch up the use of the Internet for improved, dramatically improved in many cases, internal processes, whether you are talking about personnel systems, whether you are talking about human resources or financial services, whether you are talking about inventory control, all of these basic day-to-day business operations are being done much more effectively and efficiently on the Internet. This is one of the new exciting aspects of Internet technology. Also, of course, dealing with customers, and customers don't just mean business to consumer, the kind of stuff you read about on the front page, about Amazon.Com and others. It also means business to business, because businesses are also customers, and the ability of businesses to deal much more effectively. So this is the kind of Y K renaissance I see coming, because as we come out of what Mr. Burbano and others described in the Federal sector, which also occurred in the private sector, namely, a temporary freeze in many cases on new programs and spending, and now all these projects which have been temporarily set aside are going to be brought out to the fore, and again, I think you are going to see massive increases in productivity, in major benefits to customers, and again, customers I define broadly as businesses and individual consumers. Let me talk about some other lessons learned. One of the lessons learned that was that while the government sector did an excellent job, as the previous panel discussed, the private sector also did a remarkable job. Some names of individuals who you may not have come across, or maybe you have come across, like Bill Mont and Tim Shepherd Whalen from Global , or Ron Balls from the ITU, people who are able to take entire sectors and coordinate them, you are going to hear from Ms. Hotka about the retail sector, contributed mightily to the success. I think ongoing we have learned lessons about the ability of these sectors to work both nationally and globally. I also use that as a point for future global cooperation. The International Y K Coordination Center, which both of you were very involved with and which Mr. Bruce McConnell headed so ably, has demonstrated the opportunity for global cooperation. Coming out of that, I am hopeful we will see some continued opportunities. For example, the International Y K Coordinating Center steering committee is considering the creation of what is called the Center for Digital Opportunity, which would be a cooperative program to promote Internet growth in developing countries to the same extent that it currently is in developed countries. In fact, tomorrow the steering committee will have a conference call and I am involved in that also, as is Mr. Koskinen, to see about the possibility of building on the linkages that have been established through Y K in that area. Similarly, the issue that Mr. Burbano talked about so extensively and Chairman Horn said you will be having further hearings on, the whole issue of information security. While there are information security issues which are very specific to the U.S. Government, there are many issues which are global in nature. Again, the -plus countries that work together through the international Y K cooperation center should be able to take those linkages which they established and build on them for information security. I think that is also another lesson learned. The last lesson learned which I would like to refer to, and I am a little bit over my time, is that the Y K problem was solved without government dictating what the private sector needed to do, without legislation. As you remember, you two chair people, at a hearing early on, there was actually discussion about perhaps Congress having to mandate the private sector to take specific actions. You came to the correct conclusion that, in fact, there were better ways to do that, rather than mandating specific activity. We did get through this without mandating specific activity on the part of the Congress to order the private sector to do activities because the private sector was and to work collaboratively. I think the lesson learned there is as we move ahead to other challenges in information technology, whether it be the information security area or regulation of the Internet, that the claims that the private sector made to you then that we can handle this in a collaborative manner, not working against government, but cooperatively with government, did prove true in the Y K area, and I think when Congress approaches other issues, such as information security or other issues of regulating the Internet, they should take that lesson learned, and perhaps it will also prove true that you do not need legislation, that there are other ways to get things done in this new economy and in this information revolution. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to appear before you, and I would be glad to answer any questions. Mrs. Morella. Thank you. I also want to comment on the fact that I did hear that early morning C-SPAN program, and it was very informative. Thanks for your leadership. [The prepared statement of Mr. Miller follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mrs. Morella. I am now pleased to recognize Ms. Hotka. Ms. Hotka. Chairman Morella, Chairman Horn, members of the committee, retailers appreciate your leadership on this issue, and I appreciate the opportunity to appear here with you today. As you may know, the National Retail Federation's Survival project worked for years to coordinate a joint retail- industry response to the year issue. We worked with department stores, restaurants, specialty stores, liquor stores, pharmacists, convenience stores and grocery stores to make sure that you could shop this year. People are really shopping as a result. How did retailers fare? Better than we expected. But the sector desk at the White House information coordination center that seemed to have the most to talk about was ours, retail and small business. As expected, bigger businesses experienced annoyance grade glitches and some smaller ones found out that that fix on failure policy they had was not such a great idea. Anecdotally, we know of retailers still processing credit cards manually because of the IC verify problem. One retailer's store credit cards failed. Cash registers at one chocolate store chain would not open. But the examples here are relatively minor. Now, it remains to be seen whether the global supply chain would be unaffected, larger retailers have some doubt about whether or not we have sailed through this internationally. Was it worth the work and expense? We already know the answer. While retailers spent multiple billions of dollars to find and fix and replace software and hardware and to conduct extensive testing, we also would not do it any differently. We had conducted a survey in that showed that if retailers didn't undertake this work, many key systems would simply be dead in the water. We found out that percent, all, private label credit card systems would not have worked; percent of warehouse management systems would have failed. Most retail processes are touched by technology, and our members were not willing to bet the business they would be fine without remediation. My members are astonished that some columnists have questioned the value of the investment. Mr. Burbano mentioned earlier that some countries found they were less dependent on technology than they thought. We discovered we were more dependent on technology than we had thought. So what lessons did we learn? We learned four: First, we learned that most organizations underestimated their reliance on IT despite healthy investments in technology, retailers found that some business critical processes were being run by business units on -year-old software. You cannot run a company on paradox . for DOS. It is not a good idea. Some companies maintained software they didn't need. Some key programs were being run by people with no IT background. Companies did not have contingency plans. In fact, we found only one company that had a contingency plan at all. In the end, though, savvy companies realized Y K was not an IT issue but a business issue, and that IT needs the continuing attention of the CEO. Those companies that did best had the CEO in charge of this project. We who lead industries must bring a better appreciation of IT as knowledge management, not just PCs and printers. Second, we learned that reliable information was hard to come by on this, particularly in the early days. Should retailers have believed technology companies product updates? They seemed to change hourly. Should retailers have believed government agencies' self- reports? How about suppliers? How about the fear mongers? Ultimately, no self-reported information was reliable, and retailers simply conducted their own verification in the absence of reliable test data or organizational benchmarks, this was our only choice. It was expensive and time-consuming. We know of a number of companies, for instance, that put people on airplanes all during to check on international readiness. These people simply traveled from country to country. Third, we learned that government may have a useful role in helping companies use technology as a business tool. There is no doubt, but that the white hot spotlight of your committee's attention to this issue brought home to all of us the need to work diligently. Your contributions to private industry preparedness should not be underestimated. We paid a lot of attention to those report cards. Our friends at GAO published world-class, best-practices documents that gave private industry some models to work from. John Koskinen and his talented staff helped galvanize countries, governmental bodies, private industry and the media. All were key to helping retailers who rely on a global supply chain and public confidence. We thank you all. Like Harris, we believe that this should be a partnership and not a speaking from on high. But, fourth, we learned that joint action was key. No one retailer did it alone. Fierce competitors worked together to keep the industry ready. Generous companies allowed staff to speak at conferences to spread the word to others. So going forward, we would like to continue what we have been doing for the past several years, working to protect America's business data. Congress should continue to show interest in America's information infrastructure. The White House ICC where public-private partnerships were so useful might continue to be a valuable tool. Business still needs best practices that can help smaller companies use technologies responsibly, and reliable sources of information about threats to data from hackers, viruses and industrial espionage are needed. Let's continue to work together. Public private partnerships got us through Y K, but we have compelling reasons to keep working in and beyond. Thank you. Mrs. Morella. Thank you very much for that testimony. Now we will hear from Mr. Beach. Mr. Beach. Madam Chairwoman, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to appear before the committee again. Madam Chairwoman, talking about the victory lap analogy, I live close to Hopkinton, MA, which is the start of the Boston Marathon, and I would say what we have learned with all the great work here is that we are in the first mile of a marathon, a marathon showing how pervasive technology is in all of our lives. The subject of my testimony here is in the written side, but I will orally summarize it, is lessons learned, opportunities created, and I would encourage the committee to look forward as to what are some of those exciting opportunities. Increasing the crescendo of hyperbole, we heard about John Koskinen talking about it in the last years, and Mr. Miller talking about the work as is comparable to pyramids. I would say that the year computer problem and the work that was done on it by a myriad of groups is the most remarkable peacetime example of human cooperation in the history of the world, and I have an idea for you at the end of my oral testimony. We are entering, what I see, as the age of digital enlightenment where technology is going to help nations govern better, help businesses conduct better business, and make everyone's digital life all the more meaningful. The committee asked the panelists ``was Y K hyped for profit?'' Those of us on the front lines, the ITAA and Kathy and her group and others, have no doubt that without proper remediation and all the great work that this committee has done, Y K would have had a severe impact on computer systems around the world. It is interesting, isn't it, that those companies that may have benefited from an increase in sales of computer hardware or software over the last couple of years are now reporting in the Wall Street Journal over the last couple of days saying their earnings reports are down because of Y K. So what goes around comes around, and it is all going to even out in the end. So, the long-term legacy of this challenge is going to be akin to the oil crisis that we saw in the mid- 's, where we had relatively short-term pain, and long-term we had more fuel- efficient cars. The Y K long-term legacy was simply mentioned here many times today that it caused the world to update its computing infrastructure in a relatively short period of time. I was personally surprised at how well the rest of the world made it through digitally unscathed on January st. I would say this experience was a resounding clarion call to our government and our industries that other nations, many of whom predominantly use U.S. technology, are running neck and neck with the United States. It seems to me that the digital playing field appears to be leveling off. And, in this new st century, where the economy is going to be very digital and electronic, these other countries are prepared to provide stronger global competition. On the earlier panel we talked about foreign nationals. I had an opportunity last year to travel to Bangalore, India, where I saw thousands of workers producing Y K remediation projects, many for United States firms. These workers are now going to be looking to produce products and services in their own global environment. The next big technological breakthrough is going to be e- commerce. A CIO poll recently reported that percent of American businesses now have e-commerce initiatives started. What is even more important to me is by , these e-commerce initiatives are going to be the core business models of these businesses. Shifting to opportunities for government, the Y K revolution has afforded the Federal Government and the State and local governments opportunities to modernize its computing infrastructure. We should leverage these revitalized systems to better do the business of governing. Opportunities before this House and this committee in light of legislation continue on Internet taxation, how Americans will govern using technology, closing the digital divide of the have's and have not's, and possibly the aspect of a not too long-term strategy of having the United States wean off its dependence on foreign workers. I did some work last year in Massachusetts reviewing the State's entire higher education system. While there are more and more men and women entering computer science courses in classes across the country, the challenge is that the faculties at many of these institutions are not prepared to teach the new technologies. As I mentioned in the beginning of my testimony, I had an idea. I would encourage Madam Chairman and Mr. Chairman to send on behalf of the world's IT workers, a letter to the Nobel Prize committee in Oslo recommending that a special award be given in October to the world's IT workers, where possibly a person from the informatics committee at the U.N. could go to accept it, and on a site, some place on a U.N. URL, any worker who worked on Y K could download it and proudly frame it in his or her office. In closing, Y K in context, was a massive tactical challenge, but what it underscored on a more strategic level is the importance of technology in governing and commerce, and with the seemingly stable technology infrastructure in place, now is the time to take advantage of these new opportunities. Thank you. Mrs. Morella. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Beach follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . Mrs. Morella. I think that is a fitting way to end the testimony of the panelists with this concept of the Nobel Prize and the fact that it is a great example, as you said, a feat greater than or as great as the pyramids. Ms. Hotka had some very glowing things to say about what we learned also. Coming from the private sector, it is particularly important. We have a roll call vote right now, a quorum, but we will be back for some questioning, so I would imagine minutes or so. So we will recess this hearing for about minutes. [Recess.] Mrs. Morella. I am going to reconvene this hearing. I can ask a few questions, and then if other Members come in in the meantime, they can continue to ask questions. Of course, our policy has been that if it is acceptable to you, that we might also submit questions to you by Members who may not be here. Thank you. I appreciate that. You know, I think there have been many, many benefits to the Y K work that has been done, whether or not it is the dimension of the pyramids or Nobel Peace Prize, but certainly there has been a lot of cooperation that has been so comprehendible. In going to the command station on December st, I saw many people from the private sector on their own time, unpaid, who were there for hours and spent their New Years' Eve there, and then part of New Years' morning there also. I also saw a report that National Institutes of Standards and Technology did a lot of work with small businesses in remediation of the Y K computer bug, and the small businesses have said they thought this was a concept that they hoped would continue, the idea of being able to get help and get assistance from somebody, an agency or whatever, that cared about them. So, again, it is another example of the private sector benefiting from what the public sector had done. Then just the other day at the District of Columbia hearing, both Chairman Horn and I are on that authorizing committee, I asked Mayor Williams about it, because, as you may remember, the District of Columbia was so far behind, and he was very excited about the results, the fact that they have now been able to update their computer system, they know what they have, and because technology will play such a big role, particularly as we try to revitalize the District of Columbia, that they feel they are going to benefit greatly by it. Also by working with neighboring communities too. So, again, the whole concept you all pointed out, and that is, building on the various linkages and the partnerships. Well, I am going to ask you a question that deals with people. The vast Y K repair corps is now being scattered to the winds after apparently saving the world from the Y K disaster. So now what are these people trained to correct Y K, probably those people who knew could balance, what do they do now? Can these displaced Y K workers help to alleviate the H B situation? What do you see with regard to the whole personnel issue? I will start with any one of you. Ms. Hotka, why don't we start with you first. Ms. Hotka. Just briefly, one of the things that struck us about the people that worked on this was their ability to deal with business units. IT does not live in a vacuum, and this was never an IT problem. These people went out and spent time in warehouse facilities with people who run the trucks, with suppliers, with the accounting offices and all through the business. What we are seeing in our industry is that those people will continue to work in these companies and that they will continue to work with these business units to make sure that the IT tools that are created are actually used and are used effectively. That is a skill. These are generally older people, people over , and they have got---- Mr. Miller. Speak for yourself. Ms. Hotka. Well, I am saying that because there is a tremendous emphasis, I think, in some parts of the IT world on people who are very young, who have experience in new technologies. But some of us who are not that young have some experience that might be useful, and we are finding that it is being priced in these retail companies. They don't want to lose these people. Mr. Miller. I think, Madam Chairman, what Mr. Burbano discussed is, in the Federal Government, very similarly true in the private sector. If you take the first group of people, namely, people who are interimly the staff of an organization, in most cases when the Y K issue became a priority for the organization internally, and the organization decided to use internal resources, they simply took other projects, put them off to the side and took those people and focused on Y K; and now that they have gotten through most of the Y K era, leaving aside having to get through the next months to February th, those projects, which have been temporarily frozen, are now going to come back as high priorities, and those people are going to go back and do those projects. That is one group to think about. The second group of people are the contractors who came in from outside to do work for customers, whether those customers were in government or the private sector. A lot of those companies, which provided those outside services, were in a situation where they anticipated very well the end of the Y K, they knew when their projects were going to end, and so they had to do two things: No. , they had to find new clients so they can continue to stay in business and continue to grow their businesses; and No. , they had to take into account the need to upgrade the skills of their employees to do more current projects, most of which are going to be e-commerce related or somehow on the Internet revolution as opposed to the mainframe projects. If you look at the major companies that do business and look at the revenue in versus , you will see their revenue continue to go up even as the Y K work began to drop off. The reason is that because they were able to find new customers and they were able to retrain the work force. So not only do I think this is not going to solve the H B problem, if you use the logic that I use in my testimony that this is going to be a Y K renaissance, and a lot of projects were temporarily frozen while companies were getting through the Y K problem, I think there is going to be even a bigger explosion and even more demand for IT workers. The trick is going to be, as you suggested in your question and as Ms. Hotka commented in her comments, making sure the workers do have the retraining. The computer language skills they have are not the ones most current or most in demand, and that has to be factored into the process. Mrs. Morella. I do think many of them are older, but, on the other hand, I know the University of Maryland had a special course geared toward remediation of Y K. Mr. Beach. Mr. Beach. Madam Chairman, I just would like to once again mention the aspect of what human beings like most is recognition, I am dead serious in challenging you and Chairman Horn to nominate these workers for noble awards. The international Y K cooperation center that we heard about today, and you are familiar with, and that Bruce McConnell did an incredibly good job running, had a subset called YES Corps, which was the Y K Experts Service Corps. I was fortunate to be on that steering committee. This group aimed to share information with countries about Y K, and currently it is migrating to another role. We all felt this network was created for tactically addressing Y K, the network was more valuable than the actual focus on Y K. So there is movement afoot to expound this effort. I would like to say there is a vested interest in large businesses in whatever they can do here in the States to help small businesses, because we are all living in this giant economic supply chain. Many large businesses are even more dependent now on smaller businesses. The H B visa issue, I know there is a call now to bring the limit up to , . Long-term what we have to do, and I addressed it briefly in my testimony, is more rather than fewer students in America are entering computer science courses, whether in California, Maryland or Massachusetts. I chaired last summer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a review of the entire higher education program, and the most damning finding we found was that we were talking about older people here, but the faculty, the faculty, No. , is older, is not skilled in the new technologies of JAVA, XML, you name it. There is a bottleneck there. If that bottleneck is not relieved or addressed, then our country is going to continue to have to rely on H B visa issues. Mr. Miller. Could I make one more point on personnel to follow on the earlier discussion of information security? That is an enormous problem, because we do not have information security specialists trained. That is one area where you can't do H Bs, you can't send the work offshore to Ireland or Israel or India. That work has to be done with U.S. citizens. I know President Clinton mentioned this in his national plan, and Attorney General Reno talked about it. So this is one area where the government, working with academia and business, is going to have to focus. You are going to have to convince people to go beyond their traditional education, to get additional education, plus get security clearances, because obviously, the type of people that a Federal agency or a State government wants to hire for security information, security purposes is going to need a clearance. Even you are going to find in the private sector many private-sector financial institutions and others want to get people with very high security clearances because they are being put in very sensitive security positions. Mrs. Morella. As a matter of fact, the Science Committee passed, in the first session, actually the last Congress, a computer security bill which does have the dimension of fellowships for computer security. Even that is not enough. Much more needs to be done. We have also been pushing teacher training in technology, not so much looking at the higher education, but more education from K through , to make sure that even those teachers know something about how to use technology because the youngsters do, so they can also inspire them. My legislation for women and minorities and disabled in science, engineering and technology, the commission is meeting, it will be coming up with its recommendations to get more of those groups that have traditionally not been involved, involved in those fields. Well, I thank you. I am going to now---- Mr. Horn. If you might yield on that point---- Mrs. Morella. I am going to recognize you for your questioning. Mr. Horn. Your associations could do a lot of good in bringing together the people from the Silicon Valleys of this Nation, and the community college teachers in particular. When you think that these programmers get about $ , when they are out of college or out of the community college, and what we need, speaking now as a Californian where we started the community college movement and we have about campuses from San Diego to the Oregon border, and they should be talking to the Silicon Valley types and vice versa. Because the State will never have enough money to get the equipment that is needed to educate people on to meet the people's needs as they go into the industry. It just seems to me there ought to be a summit meeting that perhaps your group, Mr. Miller, or your group and friends in the publishing world, and getting all these people in the room. When you think of what Jamie Escalante, the great teacher in L.A., that took young people that everybody had given up on and they got right at the top of the college boards, and it can be done. We need to do that and we need to get the Mexican Americans, Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Americans, whatever they are, into seeing a point in their lives where they can make a substantial income. That is only going to happen if we start, as the chairman here said, concerning the K through . That is fine. But I think the K through and have to be considered, where their role, really, is to be either an academic program or a vocational program. In this case it is both. You need the academic background. You also need the vocational background. And you need the opportunity to work on equipment that makes sense. I know from what I had to go through with a very--probably the largest school of engineering west of Texas A&M, and we were just swamped with problems on equipment in the 's and the 's. Finally, our trustees stepped up to the plate and said OK, so we will pay engineers more, we will pay people in the business school more. Well, that doesn't solve all the problems, because the equipment is the problem, and the millions that takes. And that is where it is everybody's self interest to do something along that line. Now, I don't know if you want to add anything to that or if you are willing to do that conference, but we ought to get them in the same room with the American Electronics Association and so forth. Mr. Miller. We tried to do that the last couple of years, Mr. Chairman. We are making progress. I think that the IT community discovered the community college system very recently in a sense. They didn't previously think of it as a resource, except for some chip manufacturing companies, which didn't see the need for a -year degree. So you had a couple of instances in Arizona, particularly where Maracopa Community College was training people to work in the cleaning rooms for some of the major chip manufacturers. But I think the IT industry at large didn't see the community college as a good resource. We held our first national work force convocation at the University of California at Berkeley in January , and I think that is the first time that the IT industry began to understand that the community colleges were willing to be flexible, and, frankly, they can change a lot more quickly than formal -year universities, I am sure you know as a former university president. Mr. Horn. You are absolutely correct. You won't get your supply from Berkeley. They are wonderful people. It is true. They have research designs. Ph.Ds, there is a use for some of those, face it, but you want the worker people, which does take skill, which does take imagination, and some day they might be running their own Silicon Valley firm. That is the way the whole evolution of that Santa Clara Valley has happened. Mrs. Morella. I used to teach, at a community college in Montgomery County. Mr. Horn. Absolutely. Mr. Miller. It is happening. Yesterday the National Commission on the st Century Workforce had its second field hearing, it was actually held at De Anza in Silicon Valley, and I know that that is a focus of attention. I spoke at a major event that the Houston Partnership held months ago, and virtually every attendee was there from a community college. So I think the communication is starting. We are having our third convocation in Chicago in April of this year, and have invited many of the colleges to participate. The key to the community college is obviously getting support of the State legislatures to get the funding to be able to offer the courses. In most cases State legislatures do seem willing to do that. Mr. Horn. They see it helps their economy. Mr. Miller. It is an economic development issue, not an education issue. That is what employers want to know, if I move my business there, where am I going to get my IT workers. Mr. Horn. You might have covered this while I was going over to vote, but when you look at the issues that confronted the Nation that I mentioned to Mr. Koskinen on the domestic side, do you have any particular issues that relate to technology that you think we ought to have that kind of operation that we have had in the last few years where you have somebody on behalf of the President pulling these things together, if it affects the economy and efficiency of the executive branch, which is the jurisdiction of my particular subcommittee? So what would your themes be that somebody ought to be looking at? Mr. Miller. Well, I have a couple. One we discussed, I think, at a previous hearing, which is an information security czar. I think that the Koskinen model is also applicable to the information security area. Right now, Mr. Chairman, if someone from academia came up and put a chart up on the wall of how information security is handled inside the government, I don't think that wall is big enough to put all the boxes up there, because it is split over so many places. Everyone is well intentioned and has good purposes. Mr. Horn. With the Chief Information Officer role being pretty much throughout the major agencies, hasn't that helped? Mr. Miller. That is very helpful. But, again, even there, that is just within the particular agency. We are also talking about interrelationship with the private sector, and depending on who you ask, to percent of critical infrastructure we have to protect is in the private sector. Yet we have to coordinate with the government. Who do we coordinate with? Do we coordinate with Mrs. Morella's favorite office, the CIAO office, or do we coordinate the NIPC, or do we coordinate with the National Security Council or the Commerce Department? It goes on and on and on. So we are looking for simplicity. The great thing about Mr. Koskinen's office was it was a little bitty office. He couldn't do a lot. What he could do was he could be an enabler, he could be a man who cracks the whip and try to get you to move quickly. But at the end of the day, you had to do it. He was never going to try to superimpose his own bureaucracy, either on the private sector or on a government agency. That is what I mean by a czar, not somebody that literally dictates what the private sector or the Federal agencies do. Mr. Burbano has to decide what the State Department does, Mr. Cosgrave has to understand what the IRS does. But someone who can coordinate and pull that all together, I think that would be very helpful. Mr. Horn. Well, they have a council, and I don't know how active that was before this assignment was given them, but they certainly ought to be working on the consensual part. Of course, what I am after is, and I will be putting it in shortly, is the office of management idea where the President has somebody there that knows something about management, not just the budget. Every President puts in a director that is either an accountant or politician or economist, but they don't put anybody in that knows a thing about management, that has the President's ear. So I want to split that off, and, fine, keep the director of the budget, but make a director of management. Roosevelt had that, Truman had it, Eisenhower had it. It went downhill starting with Kennedy and right through Reagan. They all politicized the Bureau of the Budget, which were professionals, and they served every President, whether they were Democrats or Republicans. It didn't matter. It didn't matter what their party was. They were professionals. And we have lost that contingent, until we got into this situation. When we wrote the President and said look, you have got to put somebody in charge, because it is going nowhere, and nothing but procrastination, and he did. He made a good choice. The same thing I wrote him with Rossotti. I said look, every President has put in tax attorneys and tax accountants, how about getting a chief executive for the job. And he did a great job in getting Mr. Rossotti. So you had two splendid appointments that turned agencies around. Mr. Miller. Absolutely. Mr. Cosgrave, who was the CIO of IRS, was previously a CEO of a company, was actually on my board of directors, and Mr. Rossotti recruited him to come and fix the Y K problem and run that. I certainly agree with you, Mr. Chairman. I guess another thing I would say in terms of a theme is with all due respect to my friends in the Federal Government who bemoan the fact there are not enough Federal IT workers, I think they are trying to stop this tide, and they are not going to win this battle. We try to help them, we meet with CIO council, et cetera, to try to figure out how the Federal Government is going to recruit more IT workers. But I think in the long-term trend they are going to lose. If they are going to lose, I would rather see them focus attention on the transition to a world where there is much more IT functionality outsourced, rather than trying to constantly refight this battle of what are they going to rejigger in the OPM manual to somehow recruit a few more IT workers. And that does not slight the Federal IT work force. I think they are great people. But I think they are just fighting a losing trend, because the delta between the Federal sector pay and the private sector pay is getting bigger and bigger. The benefits for people going into the private sector are much higher. My members never liked to voluntarily attract someone out of the Federal marketplace, because they are making their customers mad at them, but the reality is you can't throw away a resume when someone sticks one in your hand and says I want to get paid or or percent more, I want to come work for your company, than I can make working in the Federal marketplace. So I think one of the issues your subcommittee wants to look at is how do you do that transition. I think it is going to happen, and to do it smartly rather than constantly trying to smart stop the tide I think would be a much more productive use of resources. Mr. Horn. We would welcome any thoughts you have on this. I know we are already in touch with you at the staff level for the computer security hearing coming up soon. Mr. Beach. Mr. Chairman, I would like to comment briefly on your summit idea. I think that it is a very good idea and encourage you to consider submitting an op-ed piece we could run in CIO Magazine that would bring it to the attention of about , people. I like the idea of director of management for one reason. Again, I was referencing earlier the CIO Know Pulse Poll that we recently did that shows within months, in in the private side of the business are going to have e-business, and it is going to be their core business model. And how you have kept the feet to the fire for the Federal agencies here leading up to Y K, I think this director of management, whoever he or she is, should have as one of their tasks to make certain that all the agencies and the millions and billions of dollars that the U.S. Government has spent to upgrade its systems, how are these being used, what new services, what new applications are you providing for getting our bang for a buck. Getting back to the previous question, Mr. Rossotti mentioned I think that in the IRS, they upgrade each year one- third of their computers. So what happens to the third that are being thrown out? Where are these going? The other issue is there is a great opportunity in the junior colleges and the - year schools for the faculty could be adjunct faculty from the business community. These are the men and women who know most about its leading technologies. I would encourage a program of adjunct faculty to our Nation's community colleges are -year schools. Mr. Horn. You are absolutely correct, because the research universities are simply too involved in long-term research, which does have a payoff in many ways. A lot of our industry is based on that research. But in terms of getting a curriculum turned around, as you correctly viewed, that can happen much more easily in a community college. Rather than have the faculty say let's think about this for years. So that is part of the problem. This is a national crisis in skills. On the Clinger-Cohen Act, we are focusing partly on the information technology human resources issues and the need for qualified individuals and managers when that comes up. And that's another one coming up in the next few weeks. So let me skip to something else that isn't as serious as what we've had here, but I guess I'd want to ask Ms. Hotka that I'm just curious with the wonderful technology we have to trace everything in the stores of America, do you know how many generators were turned in? Ms. Hotka. We were sure, Mr. Chairman, that we would see this mass return of generators which would then be refused at the store level by stores who said that they wanted to sell it to you instead of lend it to you. We were amazed instead that stores used this as a customer retention mechanism. They said please, come back and return it and while you're here, buy something else. Mr. Horn. I was educated yesterday by my staff when I raised this that there was such a thing as a stocking fee and tell me about that. Ms. Hotka. What some of our retailers did was to charge a restocking fee so that if you brought back the generator after January in the box because you didn't need it, that they would charge percent. Some of them did that, did in fact charge that fee but some of them I think surprised all of us and used this as a way to get those valued customers back into the store and while they were there, by the way, why don't you buy this Christmas tree which is on deep discount and it worked beautifully. We saw very little demand--that was one of the things that surprised us too. We thought that the public was going to flock into stores at the end of the year and buy all kinds of stuff. We didn't see it at all. Mr. Miller. If I could make one point about your CIO elevation on the last question, I want to bring to your attention a new institution which the Virginia secretary of technology Don Upson is creating called the CIO Academy. I don't know if he's publicly rolled this out yet, but I know he's already recruited several State CIOs to be on the board of directors. He's recruited Jim Flyzik who is the CIO of the Department of Treasury who was kind enough to ask me to do it. He's got some other people from the private sector. I think this relates to the whole issue that you, of course, implemented within Clinger Cohen which is elevating the whole position of the CIO within the organization. And obviously one of the major roles that Mr. Beach's publication does is it also creates a network through his publication, his polls, his meetings he sponsors. I think Secretary Upson tends to do this in a much more educational level. I think you're going to see more and more where this is going. Now, the challenge, and I think, Mr. Beach, you had an article in your publication recently about whether the CIO job will even exist in years. You had some futurists discussing that. I think one of the conclusions was there would be no such position, maybe a chief knowledge officer or something else like that but there wouldn't be a CIO because technology will become so ubiquitous that the idea that you have a specialist would be like saying you have a telephone specialist. That won't exist anymore. Generally, I think business and government are paying a lot more attention to the whole role of the CIO and part of it is because of Y K again. It all rolls back to the fact that Y K suddenly brought to the attention of the CIO and the CFO and board of directors that this guy or gal who ran the technology wasn't some person who you could just put off on the side of the back room, that he or she was fundamental to your strategic business or strategic government delivery of services. Mr. Horn. In educating a CIO, what is your percentage of technology versus management skills? Mr. Miller. I'd say knowledge of technology is somewhere between and percent, management understanding business, understanding the core operation is probably about percent. I think the same way as a CFO. I don't think you expect the CFO to be your bookkeeper. The CFO is your financial planner, business organizer. I think the same thing is true of your CIO you don't expect him or her to be necessarily the chief technical person, that he or she is the person who is looking at how the technology fits into the business organization. Mr. Beach probably has some surveys on that I'm sure. Mr. Beach. We've got lots of them. It's along with what Harris said. I mentioned it several times here today that what has happened is that technology and e-business and e-commerce and the overuse of the letter ``E'' but what has happened is that there has got to be an extension to a company's business model. So technology has gone from being an extension of how we govern to being the core--a core part of that infrastructure of how we govern. I would agree with the percentages of Harris that the more successful CIOs that I see are those men and women who have a keen understanding not of technology but of their customers because then they could always use technology to service that customer need rather than saying I know everything about fiber and all this other stuff, you say let's go find a customer to satisfy that. So they are more customer-focused, and smart businesses and smart governments are realizing that technology is going to be a core platform in terms of how they provide a good or service. Mr. Horn. Does your magazine take a look at how Y K made us learn that we can now better manage the operation once we had to get in and say let's merge this system with that system or let's just get rid of it? To what degree do you see that movement in the executive branch? Mr. Beach. In the executive branch here in Washington? Mr. Horn. Right or the field. Mr. Beach. I think the lesson learned from the CIOs in the private sector, what Y K taught them is that no one is an island, that all these businesses are connected in these global supply chains. And I can't comment particularly on the question of executive branch, but I would say that you--no one aspect of the government, whether it's legislative, the judicial, or the executive is--it's never been that way, but technology is giving each of those branches a better opportunity to communicate and share information and govern in ways that we haven't thought of. Ms. Hotka. If I can expand on that too. I think one of the things that we found was Y K was such a flash point, that if I called up someone from a company who's not a member and said I need to talk to you about Y K, I could get that person on the phone instantly. It cut across all kinds of company barriers. There was no competitiveness at all. We had an immovable deadline and an issue that everybody understood and so everyone was willing to talk to everyone. If we can come to some kind of goal like that, obviously we'll not have this again. And thank God for it, but if we could come up with some kind of goal for technology literacy and for good corporate use of IT, we could again get to that point where I could pick up the phone and get anybody on the phone and be able to cooperate. It was useful. If we can harness that again it would be terrific. Mr. Horn. I think you're right. I've got just one or two things to say here, and then I'm going to leave and Mrs. Morella, she reminds me we have a conference, all of us at p.m. Let me say without objection, I want to file within the testimony when after Mr. Koskinen, an exchange of letters between the Secretary General of the United Nations and myself. Mrs. Morella. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Horn. No. , I would like to thank the following people that have been involved and not just in this hearing but in most of our hearings. From the subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology, J. Russell George, staff director and chief counsel; Matthew Ryan, senior policy director; Bonnie Heald, director of communications and professional staff member; Chip Ahlswede, chief clerk and unfortunately it's his last hearing with us; Deborah Oppenheim, intern; and minority staff, Trey Henderson, the counsel; and Jean Gosa, minority staff assistant; and for the Technology Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Jeff Grove, staff director; Ben Wu, counsel; Vicki Stackwick, staff assistant; the technical minority staff is Michael Quear, the professional staff member; and Marty Ralston, staff assistant; and our two court reporters today are Bob Cochran and Laurie Harris. And we thank you all for what you're doing. In closing on my behalf, I would say governments and industries worldwide have benefited from this experience. I think that testimony was very clear today. This problem has many silver linings as our witnesses have described. There are equally as many if not more people who have worked tirelessly in an effort to solve the year computer problem, and we saw some of them before us today. Obviously Mr. Koskinen is Assistant to the President and Chair of the Council on the Year Conversion. The General Accounting Office staff, particularly that staff headed by Mr. Willemssen, who was here today. Federal, State, and local government personnel, the private sector, individual grass roots organizations, and the two staffs I've mentioned and the technology subcommittee which has been our partner in overseeing this massive and unique experience and we thank them and this success demonstrates what can be accomplished with leadership, focus, and dedication, and it's a great legacy to begin this new millennium and we thank all of you for your hard work. I thank the chairwoman. Mrs. Morella. I thank you, Mr. Horn. You've expressed it very well for all of us. Hardly a time to ask another question. I guess my final one is now as we look into the near future, any comments about February and this concept of windowing? Has that been taking place and is it anything that we should be looking into, comment on, enlighten the public on? Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller. The companies would take the same attitude that you heard expressed by Mr. Koskinen and the panel this morning. They don't expect very many problems with February , but they are maintaining diligent oversight of the problem. Every leap year there's a problem. I hate to tell you, whether it's supposed to be or not supposed to, there's problems so it's not unique. I think there will be diligence, but I wouldn't expect any major problems. As far as windowing again, in a way it's postponing the problem. I think the expectation is it's been postponed long enough. It will be OK, but we got fooled last time around. There's another windowing problem which you may know about, which is not necessarily this subcommittee's concern, which there is a gentleman who has a patent on windowing who wants a lot of companies to pay him a lot of money for that. But that right now is a matter before the patent office and perhaps a matter before the court so probably Congress doesn't want to touch that one right now. Ms. Hotka. When we did our testing, when retail companies went through and tested all the systems they thought were fine, the No. thing that came up with was leap year. We don't expect the world to come to an end. We think you'll still be able to shop, but if I had to pick one thing that I thought was going to be funky that is it. We'll be in the ICC again. Mr. Beach. I would just make a comment on the windowing that I believe Eduardo and the previous panel mentioned it that keeping an inventory of those applications that have been windowed might be wise. I'd like to know where those are in years. I don't think we should make the mistake that we made in the 's and 's that these applications are not going to---- Mrs. Morella. Exactly. Even when you think of the 's, the -year span whoever thought we would now be in the year . Any final comments that you'd like to make? I want to thank you all very much for again being here, sharing your expertise, and also for all that you have done to make this Y K millennium bug be squashed. I thank you very much.

UTILITY-SCALE SOLAR POWER: OPPORTUNITIES AND OBSTACLES ---------- MONDAY, MARCH , House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, Committee on Science and Technology, Washington, DC. The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at : p.m., in the Pima County Administration Building Hearing Room, st Floor, W. Congress Street, Tucson, Arizona, Hon. Gabrielle Giffords [Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] field hearing charter SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Utility-Scale Solar Power: Opportunities and Obstacles monday, march , : p.m.- : p.m. pima county administration building hearing room, st floor w. congress street tucson, arizona Purpose On Monday, March , the House Committee on Science & Technology, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment will hold a hearing entitled, ``Utility-Scale Solar Power: Opportunities and Obstacles,'' at the Pima County Administration Building Hearing Room, Tucson, Arizona. The Subcommittee's hearing will explore the potential for utility- scale solar power to provide a significant fraction of U.S. electric generating capacity and the challenges to achieving this goal. The specific technologies to be discussed include solar thermal technology, concentrating photovoltaics and distributed solar power. Transmission, regulatory and financial issues will also be examined, along with a look at the government and private industry roles in the development of utility-scale solar power--and enabling productive partnerships between them. Witnesses Mr. Mark Mehos is the Program Manager for the Concentrating Solar Power Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Mr. Mehos will provide an overall assessment of the available resource size for solar energy in the U.S. and an introduction to the known technologies that may take advantage of solar power on a large scale. Mr. Tom Hansen is the Vice President of Environmental Services, Conservation and Renewable Energy at Tucson Electric Power. Mr. Hansen will describe a ``Solar Grand Plan'' to provide more than half of the U.S.'s electricity from solar power by . Ms. Kate Maracas is the Vice President of Arizona operations at Abengoa Solar. Ms. Maracas will describe the current state of solar thermal technology and the near- and long-term economic costs and benefits of large-scale solar power in general. Ms. Valerie Rauluk is the Founder and CEO of Venture Catalyst, Inc. Ms. Rauluk will describe the current state of distributed and concentrating photovoltaics and provide an assessment of how the marketplace for solar energy will change over the next years. Ms. Barbara Lockwood is the Manager of Renewable Energy for Arizona Public Service. Ms. Lockwood will provide the perspective of utilities on the ability for large-scale solar power to be a significant competitor in the U.S. energy sector over the next years. Mr. Joe Kastner is the Vice President of Implementation and Operations for MMA Renewable Ventures LLC. Mr. Kastner will describe his company's experience with installing and managing the Nellis Air Force Base solar array and ways to enable productive partnerships between government and renewable energy industries in general. Background An article in the January issue of Scientific American titled ``A Solar Grand Plan'' outlined a potential path to providing nearly percent of U.S. electricity demand and percent of its total energy demand, including transportation, with solar power by . It is also estimated that if fully implemented, the plan would reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to percent below levels. Approximately $ billion in various government subsidies from to would be required to fund the necessary infrastructure and make solar power cost-competitive. Several types of technology would be needed to follow through on such a plan. Photovoltaics (PV), which convert sunlight directly to electricity, are the most familiar. Vast arrays of PV cells can be deployed in the Southwest covering multiple square miles to generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity per field. A variation on this technology, known as concentrating photovoltaics (CPV), uses lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto high-efficiency solar cells. These solar cells are typically more expensive than conventional cells used for flat-plate PV systems. However, the concentration decreases the required cell area while also increasing the cell efficiency. PV and CPV systems may employ any of a number of electrical energy storage technologies for use during periods of passing clouds or into the evening. An alternate technology could also be used. Solar thermal technology produces electric power by converting the sun's energy into high-temperature heat with various mirror configurations. The heat is then used to power a conventional generator. Solar thermal plants consist of two parts: one that collects solar energy and converts it to heat and another that converts heat energy to electricity. Just as batteries may assist PV systems, molten salts and other forms of thermal energy storage technology allow this heat to be retained for later use in generating electric power. An expansive new transmission and distribution system would be required for the remainder of the country to take full advantage of the immense solar resource in the American Southwest. A study commissioned by the Western Governors' Association estimated that solar energy from the Southwest alone could provide up to , GW of electricity to the U.S. To put this in perspective, the electric generating capacity of the entire country is currently about , GW. However, the existing system of alternating-current (AC) power lines would lose a significant fraction of its energy over long hauls so the Solar Grand Plan recommends building a new backbone of high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) power transmission lines and coupling this to sites near population centers that may utilize another form of electrical energy storage technology known as compressed air energy storage (CAES). Under this scheme, electricity generated from solar power plants hundreds of miles away compresses air and pumps it into vacant underground caverns, abandoned mines, aquifers and depleted natural gas wells. The pressurized air is released on demand to turn a turbine that generates electricity, aided by burning small amounts of natural gas. Citing a study by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the natural gas industry, the Plan affirms that suitable geologic formations exist in percent of the country often close to metropolitan areas, and that a national CAES system would look similar to the current U.S. natural gas storage system. The Plan assumes relatively small increases in PV solar-to-electric efficiency from percent today to percent in and increases in efficiency for solar thermal technology from to percent. The Plan also assumes significant reductions in installed cost and electricity price based on economies of scale reaching - cents/kWh. (Today's rates for these systems in the U.S. are - cents/kWh and average overall electricity rates are currently - cents/kWh depending on the region.) Though not directly addressed by the Solar Grand Plan, one other method to generate solar power on a large scale is distributed generation (DG) which consists of smaller facilities on otherwise unused real estate (roof-tops and sites of to acres) located near the load demand and dispersed throughout many communities. DG systems typically produce under MW of power and may consist of PV and CPV components. By providing power near or directly at the point of use, DG may offer a more cost-effective near-term solution in many areas of the country. Ms. Giffords. This hearing will come to order. Good morning, everyone. It is my great, great honor and privilege to welcome you all this morning to a field hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment entitled ``Utility-Scale Solar Power: Opportunities and Obstacles.'' I want to welcome everyone here to Tucson. I want to thank Chairman Richard Elias for having us here in the Supervisor's Headquarters. Richard, where are you? Thank you so much for having us here today. We also have with us Councilwoman Nina Trasoff. Thank you for all the work that you are doing, one of our local elected officials, I appreciate having all your support. Rarely does a meeting in Congress go by when I do not have an opportunity to talk to my colleagues about how extraordinary southern Arizona is, and so that is one of the reasons why I am so pleased to have so many of our colleagues here with us today to enjoy this extraordinary part of the world that we call home. Many thanks to my colleagues who are interested in utility- scale solar power for coming. All have given up time in their district work periods to be here in southern Arizona. We are honored to have Members from around the country with us today. I believe it is a testament to the high degree of energy and interest that we have in solar technology. In particular, I would like to extend a very special welcome to the two most senior Members of the Science and Technology Committee. The Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Bart Gordon from Tennessee, unfortunately, was detained in Washington due to weather and mechanical problems with his airplane, but he is going to be joining us by telephone in just a few minutes. But, I would like to thank Ranking Member, Mr. Ralph Hall from Texas. Ralph Hall has been on the Science and Technology Committee for years, and also Energy and Commerce. So, we are very pleased to have him with us today. Also with us is Representative Dan Lipinski of Illinois, Vice Chair of the Full Committee, Representative Jim Matheson from the State of Utah, thank you for coming, and Representative Harry Mitchell, a fellow Member of the Arizona Congressional Delegation, from Tempe, Arizona. No one can remember the last time that we had so many Members of Congress in southern Arizona for an actual field hearing. So, I am particularly pleased that we are all here on a topic as important as solar energy. I would like to extend a very warm welcome to our witnesses who are here today. We are glad that you are here to share in your expertise, to enlighten the Committee and members of the public about the experiences that you have and the thoughts that you have. It was challenging to only have six panelists when we have so many talented people that are experts in solar technology, but we are very pleased that you are here to join with us today. We also have many smart and talented members of my Solar Advisory Committee that are in the audience today, and I want to thank you as well for taking this part of the world and making it so focused on solar energy and the possibilities that lay ahead of us. Finally, a welcome to all the members as well, just of the general public, who are here because they care about what is happening with the future of energy technology, and again, I want to thank you, our Members today, but also watching live on the Internet, and we know we have a streaming video and we will capture that for people who are not able to participate. In the Science and Technology Committee, it is common for our Chairman, Mr. Gordon, to refer to us as the Committee of big ideas. The notion is certainly well grounded from the history of the Committee. Just last week we celebrated years of the Science and Technology Committee, with Bill Gates coming to talk to us. It is a Committee that oversaw the days of NASA and winning the space race, the wake of Sputnik, but the Chairman's statement is as much, I believe, about the future as it is about the past. It expresses a belief which I share, that the greatest days of American innovation are the days which lay ahead. So, in my view, it could not be more fitting for the Committee to turn its attention to solar power. Solar power is a big idea, whose time has come. And, like the space program, solar is an idea that can shape our nation in significant and positive ways. In the coming months, in the coming years, we will face critical decisions on how to address climate change, reduce our dependence on foreign energy, and boost our economic competitiveness. The beauty of solar power is that it offers an elegant solution to all three of these challenges. Imagine what it would be like if every time that it rained it rained oil, big black drops falling from the sky. Don't you think that we would find some way to run around with a big bucket and collect all of that energy that was falling from the sky? I know this sounds like an absurd picture, but the reality is that what we have outside today is something very comparable to that. Literally, we have useful energy pouring out of the sky, and nowhere does it rain sunshine with greater intensity and consistency than in the American southwest. In fact, some studies show that there is enough sunshine in the southwest to power almost our entire nation. One of these studies was recently covered on--actually, was brought forward on the front cover of the ``Scientific American Magazine.'' So, in other words, the southwest is home to a national treasure that streams from the sky almost every day. That sounds like a good enough reason to start developing an effective solar bucket, and while we are at it, let us make it a really big bucket. The focus of this hearing is not just about any kind of solar power, it is about utility-scale solar power. Utility- scale refers to large installations that can generate significant amounts of electricity for the grid, but with free fuel and, virtually, no pollution. Developing solar installations on this scale creates unique opportunities, but it also presents unique challenges. So, we look forward today to hearing from our witnesses about both. Our goals in holding this hearing are to explore five key issues. First, the potential scale of solar power in America. Second, the current state of technology. Third, the benefits to our nation of embracing this energy source. Fourth, the obstacles to developing solar power in a big way. And finally, the policies that can help us overcome these obstacles. The time for solar is now. Technologies are proving, the costs are falling, and the reasons to adopt it are compelling. We need to truly understand the potential of this energy source and how we can unleash it. So, that is what today's hearing is all about. So, we should get started. Since we do not have Congressional hearings in Tucson every day, I want to briefly explain how we are going to proceed. First, some of my colleagues will make opening statements. Then we will have a chance to hear from each of the witnesses in turn. We ask our witnesses, because of our time consideration, to keep their testimony to five minutes, and we have our technology here on the table to indicate when your time is being close to up. Then, following the witnesses, each Member will have five minutes to ask questions. Once all the Members have asked questions, if time remains we will have a chance to recycle and go back to the beginning. I know that some of my colleagues have planes to catch, so we are planning on wrapping up around : . Now, following the conclusion of the formal hearing, I would like to take a short ten-minute break. I encourage people who are interested in the community to stay around, because we are going to ask our panelists to come on the dias and be able to directly answer your questions. With that, I would now like to yield to Mr. Hall for his opening statement. [The prepared statement of Acting Chair Giffords follows:] Prepared Statement of Acting Chair Gabrielle Giffords Good morning. It is my great privilege today to convene this field hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy & Environment, entitled ``Utility-Scale Solar Power: Opportunities and Obstacles.'' I want to welcome everyone to Tucson. Rarely does a hearing go by where I do not talk about Arizona so you can imagine what a pleasure it is to be able to show my fellow Committee Members why I am so proud of our community and the work we are doing together on Solar energy. Many thanks to my colleagues from the Science and Technology Committee. They have all given part of their District work period to come to southern Arizona today. We are honored to have with us Members from all over the country. This is a testament to the high level of interest in solar power, and to its relevance to the whole Nation. In particular, I would like to extend a very special welcome to the two most senior Members of the Full Science and Technology Committee: The Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Bart Gordon, of Tennessee, who was unfortunately detained in Washington due to weather and mechanical problems with his airplane. He should be joining us by phone in just a bit. And The Ranking Member, Mr. Ralph Hall, of Texas. Thank you both for coming. Also with us today are: Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, Vice Chair of the Full Committee, Rep. Jim Matheson from Utah, and Rep. Harry Mitchell, a fellow Member of the Arizona delegation. No one can remember the last time that so many Members of Congress came together in Tucson for a Field Hearing. I am particularly pleased that we are here on such an important topic. Thank you all for making the special effort to be here today. I would like to extend a very warm welcome to our witnesses. We are glad you are here to share your expertise with the Committee. It was an incredible challenge to narrow our panel down to just six. There are so many smart and talented people with important perspectives on these issues, including many members of my own Solar Advisory Council. I wish we could fit them all at the witness table, but space and time constraints prevent us from doing so. I thank all of these people for their important contributions to solar power and their work with my office on our solar initiatives. We value their expertise, and I will continue to seek their counsel and collaboration as we move forward. Finally, a special welcome to all the members of the community who are here today. Thank you for your interest in this critical issue. In the Science and Technology Committee it is common for our Chairman, Mr. Gordon, to refer to us as the ``Committee of Big Ideas.'' This notion is certainly well-grounded in history. Formed in the wake of Sputnik and initially charged with winning the space race, the Committee is now celebrating years of promoting big ideas in American science and technology. But the Chairman's statement is as much about the future as it is about the past. It expresses the belief--which I share--that the greatest days of American innovation lie ahead of us. So in my view it could not be more fitting that the Committee is turning its attention to solar power. Solar is a BIG IDEA whose time has come. And like the space program, solar is an idea that can shape our nation in significant and positive ways. In the coming months and years, we will face critical decisions on how to address climate change, reduce our dependence on foreign energy, and boost our economic competitiveness. The beauty of solar power is that it offers an elegant solution to all three of these pressing concerns. Imagine what it would be like if every time it rained, it rained oil--big, black drops falling from the sky. Don't you think we'd find a way to catch some of that bounty from the heavens? I think we'd be running around with big buckets, scooping up every available drop. As absurd as that picture may be, with solar energy we have something just as good--useful energy that is literally pouring down from the sky. And nowhere does it ``rain'' sunshine with greater intensity and consistency than in the American Southwest. In fact, some studies show there's enough sunshine in the Southwest to power almost our entire country! One of these studies was recently reported in a cover story in Scientific American. In other words, the Southwest is home to a national treasure that streams from the sky almost every day. That sounds like a good reason to get serious about developing an effective solar bucket. And while we're at it, let's make it a big bucket. The focus of this hearing is not just any kind of solar power, it is utility-scale solar power.

The time for solar is now: technologies are improving, costs are falling, and the reasons to adopt it are increasingly compelling. We need to truly understand the potential of this energy source, and how we can unleash it. That's what today's hearing is about. Mr. Hall. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and I am honored to be here. What she did not tell you is that I am the oldest guy in the United States House of Representatives, and that makes me the dean. I am years old, but I was running at : this morning, two to three miles every morning. I am trying to stay young to keep up with my grandchildren. I get a little sick of some of them telling old man jokes, Madam Chair, about me. The latest one was that a woman's husband was about to quit golfing because he was , and he could not see where the ball was going. And, she hated to see him leave golf and be at home all the time. She said, well, my brother is and he does not golf but he likes exercise. He has wonderful vision and he can see, I will bet he could tell you where your ball went. And, they worked that out. That following Monday out on the golf course he hit that ball, and it was way up in the air. He said, Orville, are you watching it? He said, yeah, I am watching it. He said, is it still up there? He said, yeah. Can you see it? Yeah, I can see it. Has it hit yet? He said, yeah, just hit. He said, where did it go. And, he said, I cannot remember. So, us senior Members have problems of all kinds. But in this campaign--I just won the primary election, and the ``Dallas News'' called me an old geezer. And I made the argument, Madam Chairman, that it does not hurt to have--I do not recommend a whole floor of old -year-old guys or women, but it does not hurt to have one old geezer up there. And, I had all kind of call-ins and letters and everything, and finally the guy that won the contest told me my motto should be, ``Win One for the Geezer,`` and that is what we did. But, I am glad and honored to be here with you in Tucson, and this very important hearing on solar energy. I am anxious to listen. I am here more to listen than I am to talk. The longest speech I will make is one that I will be reading to you right now in a few minutes. I just want to say that I have often said that our country needs to become more energy independent, and to do that we need to use all the forms of energy. Americans, we have many forms of energy, and we just passed an energy bill a year and a half ago that had some incentive for every form of energy. And, energy is important, it is important in that if we solve our energy problems we also solve our war problems, because energy or lack of energy is the cause of most wars. It is the causation of it. Japan did not dislike this country. Cordell Hull and Henry Stimson had cut their oil off. They had months of national existence with no oil. So, we had to know they were going to break out and go south into Malaysia or somewhere. That was an energy war, it was not because they did not like us. Japan today is probably the best friend we have in the world, the best partner we have, I think. And, I would like to see them arm again, because they know how to deal with the Chinas, and the Koreas, and all that, but that is not what we are here about today. We are here about energy, and, of course, when George Bush, the elder George Bush, sent , youngsters to Iraq ten or years ago, that was to keep a bad guy named Saddam Hussein from getting his foot on half the known energy in that part of the world. That was an energy war, in my opinion. And, that is how important this hearing is, and solar is such an important part of energy. A balanced solution can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy, and that is one thing we really need to do, to make our air and water cleaner, most importantly, a viable solution reduces the cost of energy for Americans so that their economy can continue to grow. As demand rises by an estimated percent in the electricity sector by , we are going to need solutions that keep America economically prosperous and competitive. As is evident here in the desert of the American southwest, the sun provides an abundant source of energy. Citizens have been using this source for years to power many small and some large-scale projects and devices. And, an entire small community of astronauts live on the International Space Station that is run entirely on solar energy. Yet, solar energy makes up a very small proportion of our overall consumption picture, only . percent of global energy demand is met by geothermal solar and wind energy combined. In the United States, statistics by the Department of Energy from indicate that solar energy accounted for one percent of the total U.S. energy consumption, and . percent of our electricity generation. Part of the reason this resource is not widely used is that sunlight is not constant, it is not focused. The amount of energy generated depends on the time of day, location, and weather conditions. In order to use solar energy for stable grid operations, we need better storage techniques. To this end, I introduced a bill last year, the Energy for America Act, which included the provision permitting research and development and demonstration of energy storage technologies for electricity transmission and distribution. I am pleased that this provision was included in the energy bill signed into law last year. So, Madam Chair, I look forward to hearing this testimony today by this very esteemed panel of individuals, on how America can better harness the power of the sun to generate more utility-scale power that lowers the cost to taxpayers and consumers. We write law up there. We write the law, but we write it based on people that know more about what we are talking about than we do, and that is this panel and people just like you. We will take your testimony, the rest of this committee, and the rest of Congress will have the opportunity to read it. Some of them will read it, but it can be the major part of a bill that would be introduced later, probably by Madam Chair with many of us being her co-sponsors. With that, I thank you, and I yield back my time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Ralph M. Hall Thank you. I am pleased to be here today in Tucson, Arizona for this important hearing on solar energy and I want to thank Rep. Giffords for organizing this gathering. I have often said that America needs to become more energy independent, and to do that we need to use all forms of energy. Americans currently have, and will continue to need, reliable and affordable domestic energy. Citizens are rightfully concerned about rising energy prices and protecting the environment. A balanced solution reduces our dependence on foreign sources of energy while also making our air and water cleaner. Most importantly, a viable solution reduces the cost of energy for Americans so that our economy can continue to grow. As demand rises by an estimated percent in the electricity sector by , we will need solutions that keep America economically prosperous and competitive. As is evident here in the desert of the American Southwest, the sun provides an abundant source of energy. Citizens have been using this source for years to power many small and large-scale projects and devices.

I look forward to hearing the testimony today by this esteemed panel of individuals on how America can better harness the power of the sun to generate more utility-scale power that lowers the cost to taxpayers and consumers. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Hall. I would now like to yield to the Chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, Mr. Gordon, who will offer his opening remarks (by phone). Chairman Gordon. Thank you. I am disappointed as to the mechanical problem that I cannot join all of you in southern Arizona today, but I want to thank you, Representative Giffords, for taking the lead and putting together this important hearing, and I want to thank my colleague, Old Geezer, and the other colleagues there, for being on the scene, and I know you are going to be bringing back a good report for us. It is obvious that solar energy has the potential to provide a significant amount of power in Arizona, and I look forward to learning more about how states that do not get quite as much sun, like my own State of Tennessee, might be able to benefit from the tremendous resource we have in the southwest. And again, I would point out that in Germany installed about seven times more solar power than the entire U.S., and that Germany's solar resources are roughly equal to Alaska's. So, I know that we can be doing much more to utilize the sun's energy. It is clear that a major component of any scheme to use solar power on a large scale has to be energy storage. So, I am encouraged by the grand solar plan that Mr. Hansen will be describing. Additionally, further development in advanced batteries will also be a critical part of the distributed generation system that Ms. Rauluk will talk more about. I am pleased about the bipartisan work last year on the energy storage, which had official contributions in this area from both you, Madam Chair, and Mr. Hall, as it was introduced in the latest energy bill and became law in December. An improved transmission system is also needed, especially, if we ever expect to get a large fraction of our energy from remote regions where renewable resources, like solar and wind, are concentrated. I am also concerned about the nexus between water and energy, something that we are going to be looking into more this year on the Committee. While regular solar panels do not need much water, except to clean them on occasion, some estimate that solar thermal technology uses more water than a typical coal plant. So, it is important that while we move forward we take the whole picture into account, and do everything we can to avoid trading one big problem for another. And, I am excited about the opportunities that large-scale solar power present to create thousands of new green jobs, and reduce our dependency on old sources of energy. Our committee will continue to do everything we can to help overcome the barriers to getting us there. Representative Giffords, thank you again for your strong leadership to promote solar energy, and thanks to this distinguished panel of witnesses for being here today. I yield back my time. [The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:] Prepared Statement of Chairman Bart Gordon Thank you, Congresswoman, for taking the lead in putting together this important hearing. It is obvious that solar energy has the potential to provide a significant amount of power right here in Arizona, and I look forward to learning more about how states that don't get quite as much sun, like my home State of Tennessee might be able to benefit from the tremendous resource we have in the Southwest. Then again, I could point out that in , Germany installed about seven times more solar power than the entire U.S., and that country's solar resources are roughly equal to Alaska's, so I know that we could be doing much more to utilize the sun's energy. It's clear that a major component of any scheme to use solar power on a large scale has to be energy storage. I am encouraged that the Grand Solar Plan that Mr. Hansen will describe would make use of compressed air and thermal energy storage technologies. Further developments in advanced batteries will also be a critical part of the distributed generation systems that Ms. Rauluk will talk more about in just a few minutes. I'm proud that our committee's bipartisan work last year on energy storage, which had essential contributions in this area from both you and Mr. Hall, was included in the latest energy bill that became law in December. An improved transmission system is also needed especially if we ever expect to get a large fraction of our energy from the remote regions where renewable resources like solar and wind are concentrated. Our current system of power lines isn't robust enough to carry large amounts of power from these centers to consumers everywhere. Too much energy would be lost over the long distances between generation and delivery of power. Studies by Oak Ridge National Laboratory show that new high-voltage direct current lines lose far less energy than existing transmission lines over the same distances. They may also be more reliable and cheaper to build. I look forward to hearing more about the prospects for making these kinds of changes to our electric grid system from this panel. And I am also concerned about the nexus between water and energy. While regular solar panels really don't need much water except to clean them on occasion, some estimates show solar thermal technology using more water than a typical coal plant. It is important that, moving forward we take the whole picture into account and do everything we can to avoid trading one big problem for another. I am excited about the opportunities that large-scale solar power presents to create thousands of new green jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Our committee will continue to do everything we can to help overcome the barriers to getting us there. Representative Giffords, thank you again for your strong leadership to promote solar energy, and thanks to this distinguished panel of witnesses for being here today. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Next, I would like to yield to Representative Harry Mitchell, for his opening statement. Mr. Mitchell. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would also like to thank Chairman Gordon and Congresswoman Giffords for organizing this field hearing. As a fellow freshman Member of Congress, from the sunny State of Arizona, Ms. Giffords and I have a unique perspective on how to address our nation's energy crisis. We are lucky here in Arizona to enjoy over days a year of sunshine. We have a real opportunity to brighten our state's future by investing in solar energy research and technology. As solar technology advances, I believe that Arizona will be a leader in clean alternative energy production. Refocusing our energy production on alternative sources such as solar is critical for our national security and the environment. Moreover, investing in solar energy is vital to Arizona's economy. Recently, Arbengoa Solar, and Arizona Public Service, announced exciting plans to develop the Solana Generating Station, and that is a megawatt solar thermal energy plant, right here in the southwest. This will be the world's largest solar power plant. Solana will not only be a leading source of emission-free electricity, but it will also start significant development for Arizona. However, the Arbengoa and Arizona Public Service executives have candidly told us that the Solana project will not happen without the extension of essential solar tax credits. I am proud of the work that we have done in Congress to make sure that utility-scale solar projects, in particular, like Solana, continue to benefit from solar tax credits. Recently, I voted for, and the House passed, the Renewable Energy Conservation Act, which would extend the percent investment tax credit for solar energy property for eight years, through . For the first time, public utilities would also be able to claim this investment tax credit. I remain committed in doing what I can do in Congress to encourage further development and production of solar energy, and I would also like to thank two people from my district who are here to testify today. Barbara Lockwood is the Manager of Renewable Energy for Arizona Public Service, and Kate Maracas is the Vice President of Arbengoa Solar's Arizona Project. Both Arizona Public Service and Arbengoa are leaders in utility- scale solar energy and are working together to develop the Solana plant. I look forward to hearing more about what we can do to establish Arizona's reputation as the Solar State, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. I would like to yield a few minutes to Representative Matheson for his opening statement. Mr. Matheson. Well, thank you, Madam Chair. I will be very brief, because I am looking forward to hearing from the panel. But, I just do want to emphasize that the Science Committee is a very bipartisan committee in the House of Representatives. It is a committee that usually takes on a longer-term view on issues, and I think the issues before the Science Committee are really the issues that matter when you look out a couple of generations from now. Congresswoman Giffords, you have been a leader in advocating the solar energy issue. You are a great Member of the Science Committee, and I am really impressed with how you have brought this hearing together today, and I just want to acknowledge that in your freshman term you have already established yourself as a real champion for this issue, and I will yield back my time. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Matheson. Representative Lipinski. Mr. Lipinski. I just want to very briefly say, back in I was in th grade. We had a science fair. I did a science fair project on solar energy. It seems like in the--well, soon afterwards, we stopped having much interest in solar energy. It seemed like years ago that was the emerging energy technology, where we had all these concerns about high gas prices, what is going to happen with oil, our oil supply, but here we are years later, it feels like we are in the same place. It is very important that we do not make mistakes now that we made back then. So, that is why I am very happy that Congresswoman Giffords is holding this hearing today. You know, having this many Members of Congress come out to a field hearing just really shows how important the issue is, and the role that Congresswoman Giffords is playing here--you know, this is a freshman Member of Congress--to have all this out here. As Vice Chairman of the Science Committee, I think this is just a fantastic opportunity that we have here today. This is critical for the future of our country, and it is very important, critical for southern Arizona, certainly, and I look forward today to hearing from all the witnesses here today, and making sure that we do everything we can at the federal level so that we can take advantage of what is available, what solar energy makes possible for us. And, I know Congresswoman Giffords is going to be a leader in Congress in doing that. So, I yield back. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Smith follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Adrian Smith Thank you, Madame Vice Chairwoman. Nebraska is a state blessed with many natural resources, not least of which is sunshine. I have long held, and continue to believe, the United States needs to explore a diverse array of energy technologies. Solar energy is one of many technologies which hold exciting potential. It is one of our most ubiquitous and reliable resources. Although there are challenges associated with capturing and storing solar energy, they are not insurmountable. I believe solar energy will play an important role in our future energy security. I support policies which encourage innovation, research, development, and investment in renewable energy. We need to encourage long-term investments in solar energy, as well as wind energy, biofuels, nuclear power, and hydro-power. Our own domestic oil and gas resources should not be overlooked. Thank you, Madame Vice Chairman, and I look forward to working with you to further policies which will promote research, development, and investment in solar technologies and other energy resources, leading to better energy security and national security for every Nebraskan and every American. Ms. Giffords. Now we would like to hear from our panelists, our witnesses. We are going to start, with just a couple brief seconds of introduction. We are going to hear from Mr. Mark Mehos, who is the Program Manager for the Concentrating Solar Power Program at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado. So, thank you so much for being here. We are going to hear from Mr. Tom Hansen, who is Vice President of Environmental Services, Conservation and Renewable Energy, at Tucson Electric Power, also featured in the ``Scientific American Magazine'' article, so great to have you here as well. Ms. Kate Maracas is the Vice President of Arizona Operations at Abengoa Solar. We have heard a lot about your company and the proposed project. We are excited that you are here today as well. Ms. Valerie Rauluk is the Founder and CEO of Venture Catalyst, Inc. She is a passionate supporter of solar energy, but also speaks on behalf of the business community as well. So, Ms. Rauluk, thank you for being here. Ms. Barbara Lockwood is the Manager of the Renewable Energy for Arizona Public Service, APS, thank you for coming down from Phoenix, we welcome you. And finally, Mr. Joe Kastner, the Vice President of Implementation Operations for MMA Renewable Ventures, LLC. We are so pleased to have you in southern Arizona. Thank you so much. As I said earlier, our witnesses will have five minutes to present your oral testimony. Your written testimony will be inserted into the record, and when we are finished with the witnesses' testimony, remember that we will take turns asking questions of our witnesses. And, we will begin with you, Mr. Mehos, please. STATEMENT OF MR. MARK MEHOS, PROGRAM MANAGER, CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER PROGRAM, NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB, COLORADO Mr. Mehos. Okay, thank you, Madam Chairman, thank you Members of the Committee, for giving me the opportunity to speak today. I did provide written testimony and ask permission to provide a Power Point oral presentation. Much of my information is better viewed than discussed. So, I was asked to present information on, basically, some background on utility-scale solar power. I will do that. At NREL we have done a lot of analysis on the overall resource side for utility-scale solar generation in the U.S., especially with an emphasis on the southwest. I was asked to present information on what the Federal Government can do to facilitate deployment, and finally, what can the Federal Government do to kick start utility-scale solar. Real quickly on some background of utility-scale solar technologies. When we talk about utility-scale solar we are really talking about two different markets, solar with storage, which we call dispatchable generation, which I will discuss in a little bit, and solar without storage or, basically, non- dispatchable, meaning that it will generate electricity when the sun is shining. On the dispatchable storage, we are really talking about three categories of technologies, and there are variations within these that I do not have time to discuss, but there's the parabolic trough up on the top of the screen, the power tower over to the lower left, and finally the linear fresnel, which is an upcoming technology over on the lower right. Each of these technologies are thermal-based technologies, which means they use concentrated sunlight to generate heat that can then be converted to electricity using conventional steam sites. The solar without storage, or what we call the non- dispatchable technologies, are just that. They are, basically, they cannot use storage, and there is three technologies that can fall into this category, the dish engine, which is on your upper, or on the lower side of the screen now on your left, concentrating photovoltaic technologies, which is in the middle, and then finally flat plate PV technologies, just like those that are on the home, but in a much larger scale for utility-scale applications. On the top, most of these are built in very large installations, on the order of , , megawatts. People are even talking about much larger installations. Their economies of scale forced them toward that side. On the lower part of the screen, the non-dispatchables, typically, those are much smaller-scale technologies, on the order of kilowatts to tens of kilowatts, which can then be gained together to the similar megawatt plants for large utility-scale applications. So, I talked about the dispatchable technologies. Why do we, or why do utilities, like dispatchable power? Primarily, what we do with dispatchable power, is we collect a lot of that energy that is shining on our collectors during the daytime, we store a lot of that energy, or most of that energy, and we distribute that energy over a larger period of the day. So, what does that do for us? It gives us a much higher value for that energy collected. If we were just dispatching during the peak times of the day, that is a very high value period, certainly, but especially in the southwest when people come home and they turn on their air conditioners, and their TVs, and everything else, that peak load really does go throughout later into the evening and even into the night. And so, we are allowed to take on that higher value production later into the day, not just during the daytime. It also allows us to lower the cost of the technology, basically, taking what amounts to be a fairly high capital cost for any solar technology and amortizing that high capital cost over a larger number of hours, instead of operating annually at percent of the year, we can operate up to percent or even or percent of the year. So, it allows you to really take that energy and lower the cost, due to that larger amortization. Okay. So, you asked the question regarding what is the resource potential, so at NREL we have done a significant amount of analysis using geographic information systems as a start, to try to screen where the most economical locations for large-scale solar can make sense. Up in the upper left-hand corner, I show the unfiltered solar resource, basically, the darker red spots are where the highest solar resource exists. But, if I take this entire southwest region and compare that southwest region to anywhere else in the world the southwest is as high or higher than anyplace else in the world as far as its solar resource. But, that is not all we need to look at. We need to look at other exclusions that can lower the economic value of that. The first thing we want to do, on the upper right-hand corner, is to exclude those areas that have a lower solar resource. We picked six hours, six kilowatt hours per meter squared per day, not that in the long-term you could not build economic plants, but we were looking more in the near-term. On the lower left-hand corner, we start looking at land exclusions. This is utility-scale solar. Typically, plants can be as large as one square mile, for the APS plant three square miles, so we are looking at large tracts of land that we are not going to build in wilderness areas, we are not going to build in urban areas, and so we take those types of exclusions, and that is the lower left-hand corner. Finally, because we are trying to minimize costs for constructing the plant, we are looking at fairly flat land. That does not have to be the case for some technologies, the most aggressive case is in the lower right-hand corner where we have looked at just one percent slope land. So, when we do that, and we look at that fairly aggressive filtering scenario, we still have times the current U.S. generating capacity, just in that small percentage of land that is left over. The current U.S. capacity is about , gigawatts, and I am showing a solar capacity with those lands of , gigawatts of potential. Okay. So, you asked what can the Federal Government do to support this technology. I should say on that last map there are a couple items in my written testimony. One is, a lot of that land that I showed, while a lot of that lies on private lands, much of that lies on federal lands, on Bureau of Land Management lands, on Defense lands, so there is an effort within the Department of Energy to try to open access, to try to reduce barriers to permitting, for example, to putting some of these large scale solar plants on federal lands. And so, the Federal Government can continue to support that effort. Also based on that map, much of that solar resource, while it is located near existing load, located near existing transmission, much of that transmission is constrained, and so to the degree that the Federal Government can support regional efforts to try to extend that transmission into these high- value areas, whether it is solar, or whether it is wind, or other renewable resources, please continue that effort. Probably one of the most important near-term issues facing large-scale solar is the extension of the percent investment tax credit. So, this is a quick example of the cost reduction associated with going from a percent permanent investment tax credit to the percent investment tax credit, basically, about a percent reduction in cost, which does not seem like an awful lot, but this technology is right on the margin, as I will show in a second, that percent reduction in cost to make or break these systems. So, this is a curve based on a regional deployment system model developed at NREL, that competes solar technologies, wind technologies, against conventional technologies. I will not go into detail, but without an extension of the existing percent investment tax credit, in other words, just the percent investment tax credit, we see very little new penetration of utility-scale solar technology in the near-term. You do see it come on line in the long-term, as conventional costs start to rise, and as our costs start to reduce based on the R&D that happens within the laboratory system. If you do extend that percent tax credit by eight years, and it is important to note that a two-year extension does nothing, and eight-year extension will allow, according to our models, and we hear this out in the public sector, quite an increase, up to gigawatts in the near-term of this technology. So, the extension of the tax credit is extremely important. This just gives you a more visual representation of that, without the extension of the tax credit, and our model does go to , but this is the nearer-term look. You will get some initial penetration that is basically driven by some of the State portfolio standards, and that initial penetration will probably happen or years from now, but you will get some initial penetration, and this, basically, the colors show capacity in megawatts. So, low penetration. If you were to extend this investment tax credit by eight years to , in this case I am showing the data, then you are looking at significant penetration in Arizona, in California, down in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, all of these states driven, primarily, by the extension of this tax credit. You asked what would be needed to kick start utility-scale solar. Right now, within the DOE program, utility-scale solar is about $ million, primarily, focused on concentrating solar power of $ million budget, which is mostly photovoltaic and distributed generation. NREL and Sandia, at the request of DOE, did an exercise to see what could happen to accelerate utility-scale solar, and we estimated about $ million per year to achieve accelerated goals. Those accelerated goals included being competitive in intermediate load markets by , a five-year acceleration of the current goal, and to be competitive in carbon-constrained base load markets by , which was not a goal previously at all. To achieve those goals, there needs to be R&D emphasis on advanced thermal storage systems, and higher temperature systems, primarily, the troughs and the tower systems, which are the systems that are high temperature and allow for thermal storage. I believe that's the end of my presentation. [The prepared statement of Mr. Mehos follows:] Prepared Statement of Mark Mehos Madame Chairman, thank you for this occasion to present and discuss information related to opportunities and obstacles for utility-scale solar power. I am the Manager of the Concentrating Solar Power Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). NREL is located in Golden, Colorado, and is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary laboratory for research and development (R&D) of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. I am honored to be here and to speak with you today. I truly believe that solar power--both concentrating solar power and photovoltaic technologies--can provide a significant level of generating capacity in the United States if cost goals established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) can be achieved. Reaching these goals will require a carefully balanced blend of DOE and industry sponsored R&D and government policies. Introduction to Solar Technologies Solar energy can be converted into electricity by means of photovoltaic (PV) or concentrating solar power (CSP) systems. Photovoltaics is the technical word for solar panels that create electricity. Photovoltaic material converts sunlight directly into electricity through a device called a solar cell. When sunlight strikes a solar cell, electrons are dislodged, creating an electrical current that can be captured and harnessed to do useful work. Solar cells are connected together electrically to produce modules, and modules are mounted in PV arrays that can measure up to several meters on a side. Flat-plate PV arrays can be mounted at a fixed angle facing south, or they can be mounted on a tracking system, allowing the array to follow the sun in one or two axes to capture more sunlight over the course of a day. About to PV arrays can provide enough power for a household. However, for large electric utility or industrial applications, hundreds or thousands of arrays can be interconnected to form a single, large ``utility-scale'' PV system. Higher efficiency solar cells, because of their high cost, are better suited to operate under concentrated sunlight. Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) collectors use lenses or mirrors as optics to focus the sunlight onto the high-efficiency cells. The main idea is to use very little of the expensive semi-conducting PV material while collecting as much sunlight as possible with lower-cost concentrating optics. CPV systems are being considered primarily for utility-scale applications. CSP technologies use concentrating optics to generate high temperatures that are typically used to drive conventional steam or gas turbines. Due to economies of scale, CSP is generally considered a central-generation technology, rather than a source of distributed generation. The three main types of concentrating solar power systems are parabolic trough systems, power tower systems, and dish/engine systems. Variants of these systems are also being considered, such as the linear Fresnel reflector system, which uses flat, rather than parabolic, mirrors to concentrate the solar thermal energy. Parabolic trough systems concentrate the sun's energy through the use of long, linear parabolically curved mirrors. The mirrors track the sun, focusing sunlight on a receiver that runs along the focal line of the trough. A heat-transfer fluid, typically a synthetic oil, flows through the receiver, rising in temperature as it flows along the length of the collector. The hot oil is then used to boil water in a conventional steam generator to produce electricity. Alternatively, water can be boiled directly in the receiver using a direct-steam receiver. A key advantage of parabolic trough systems is that they can use thermal storage, giving the systems the flexibility to dispatch electricity coincident with peak utility loads, which often occur late in the evening. Many systems in Spain, as well as the system announced by Arizona Public Service last month, will make use of this feature. Parabolic trough systems are currently the most commercially developed technology. A power tower system uses a large field of mirrors, called heliostats, to concentrate sunlight onto the top of a tower, where a receiver is located. This focused sunlight heats a working fluid such as molten salt or water/steam flowing through the receiver. Similar to oil in a parabolic trough receiver, the salt in a tower receiver is used to generate steam (using heat exchangers) to generate electricity through a conventional steam generator. As with trough systems, tower systems can be integrated with thermal storage. Future low-cost storage options should allow both troughs and towers to operate competitively in the near-term in intermediate load markets and in the future in base load markets, offering a potential alternative to coal-based generation. A dish/engine system uses a mirrored dish, similar to a very large satellite dish. The dish-shaped surface collects and concentrates the sun's heat onto a receiver, which absorbs the heat and transfers it to a gas within a Stirling engine or gas turbine. The heat allows the gas to expand against a piston (in a Stirling engine) or to power a turbine to produce mechanical power. The mechanical power is then used to run a generator or alternator to produce electricity. Resource Potential for Solar Energy in the United States A study commissioned by the Western Governors' Association (WGA) looked at the solar resource and suitable land available in seven southwestern U.S. states, including California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) determined optimal CSP sites with high economic potential by excluding regions in urban or sensitive areas, regions with low solar resource, and regions where terrain would inhibit the cost- effective deployment of large-scale plants. Even with this high level of exclusions, the WGA solar task force calculated a capability of generating up to , gigawatts (GW) using CSP technologies--almost seven times the current electric generating capacity of the entire United States. The WGA study found that, with a build-out of only two to four GW of CSP, the technology will be competitive with conventional natural-gas-fired combined-cycle plants with a cost approaching cents per kilowatt-hour. The southwestern United States is not the only area with great potential for CSP. Projects are under way in Spain and Northern Africa, with additional projects planned for Israel, the Middle East, Northern Mexico, and Australia. In total, more than utility-scale CSP plants are under development worldwide, primarily driven by policies favorable to large-scale deployment of the technology. Two questions are now addressed that relate to the role of the Federal Government in the success of utility-scale solar projects in the Untied States. The first question is: How can the Federal Government facilitate the deployment of utility-scale solar projects? At the request of the U.S. Department of Energy, NREL analyzed the impact of policy (both State and federal) and R&D on the penetration of utility-scale solar generating systems in the southwest United States. The Renewable Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model, developed at NREL, was used to estimate the U.S. market potential of wind and solar energy for the next to years. The model competes these technologies against the more-conventional generation technologies of hydro, gas-combustion turbine and combined-cycle systems, coal, and nuclear. Future sequestration technologies are also included within the ReEDS model. Results from the model indicate that utility-scale solar technologies can produce nearly GWs of capacity in the Southwest by . Significantly more capacity is possible if dedicated transmission can supply generation to load centers located outside the Southwest. However, a key outcome of the analysis is that initial market penetration is extremely dependent on the continuation of the existing percent investment tax credit (ITC). According to the analysis, without an extension of the ITC, new capacity will be delayed about to years--until lower CSP generation costs resulting from R&D and international market development allow CSP technologies to compete against future conventional plants. The Federal Government can facilitate the deployment of solar power plants by providing access to land. Utility-scale solar projects require considerable acreage. The -megawatt (MW) Arizona Public Service project mentioned earlier will cover three square miles. That is nearly , acres to produce the power for , homes. The Federal Government owns large tracts of land in the West. Doing an environmental study of those lands and streamlining the process by which industry can lease tracts found suitable for solar power projects will shorten the time it will take to build projects on these lands. Finally, the Federal Government can support efforts to relieve transmission congestion throughout the West. Existing transmission lines are operating at near capacity. New lines must be built to bring power from solar plants located in the areas where the solar resource is best, often in remote sunny regions. Our transmission grid is like our highway system, but without the interstate highways. An ``interstate'' grid system would facilitate the transmission of solar power from the Southwest to load centers throughout the United States. As described earlier, the United States has an enormous solar resource. Once we reduce the cost of the technology, the next challenge will be to distribute the electricity produced to the people who need it. A second questions is: How does the level of federal investment required to ``kick start'' utility-scale solar compare with that required by other technologies seeking government support? NREL scientists are studying a number of renewable energy technologies. The country is entering a period where it must start making the transition to new sources of energy. DOE and NREL are pursuing a portfolio approach of technologies--such as solar, wind, biomass, hydrogen, and geothermal--that could play a role in the future. All these technologies have the potential to become cost competitive with fossil generation. The price tag of utility-scale solar projects is large. For example, the -MW plant mentioned above will cost more than a billion dollars. Fortunately, the Federal Government does not need to contribute directly to cover the cost of these plants. The southwestern states have established renewable portfolio standards that have created the market for utility-scale power plants. Some states have established price guidelines by which they recognize that they will initially have to pay more for the renewable power. The additional costs are passed along to the rate payers. Thus, the bulk of the cost for establishing cost-effective utility-scale solar power is being borne by the states. If the Federal Government were to decide that utility-scale solar power was important, then they could partner with the states, which have already kick-started utility-scale solar. Most of the money appropriated for solar energy R&D focuses on residential and commercial applications. Utility-scale solar receives about $ million out of a total solar budget of $ million. To meet the goals mentioned earlier, the DOE estimates that this funding would need to be doubled. Researchers at NREL work closely with the CSP industry and universities to develop new technologies that are more efficient and less costly. A study commissioned by DOE several years ago showed that reducing the cost of solar technology depends about percent on R&D and percent on actually building solar projects. This combination of R&D and deployment could well bring the cost of solar power into alignment with fossil generation in the intermediate power markets. And with low-cost storage, the overall cost may also align with future baseload power markets if carbon constraints are considered. Summary Addressing our near-term needs in solar power will require a national strategy that promotes the deployment of solar systems and processes that are ready to serve us today. At the same time, addressing our longer-term needs and achieving a significant contribution from solar power technologies will require a major new commitment to the research needed to deliver the next--and subsequent-- generations of CSP, PV. and other new solar technologies. Thank you.

Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Mehos. Mr. Hansen, please. STATEMENT OF MR. THOMAS N. HANSEN, VICE PRESIDENT, ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE ENERGY, TUCSON ELECTRIC POWER Mr. Hansen. Good afternoon, Chairwoman Giffords, thank you for the opportunity, thank you, distinguished Members of the Committee, for the opportunity to be here today to discuss with you what I consider a very important solution and a plausible solution to our energy challenges for the future, the ``Solar Grand Plan,'' as described in the ``Scientific American'' issue in January of . While many energy resources are sustainable and environmentally neutral, only solar energy can supply all of our projected energy needs for the long-term sufficient needs to meet our long-term needs in the United States for centuries to come. The January, issue of ``Scientific American Magazine'' details that ``Solar Grand Plan,'' and it could realistically provide percent of U.S. electric needs by , and percent of U.S. electric needs by the year . I should point out that my comments do not necessarily represent the views of Tucson Electric Power (TEP), although I'm employed by TEP these comments are based on my thoughts and my development of a totally alternative energy system over the last decade. So, TEP has not, at this point, taken a position on this ``Solar Grand Plan.'' The three core components of the ``Solar Grand Plan'' are first, solar energy installations, of course, to convert the sunlight into electricity. The second component, and a very important component, is energy storage. We need to be able to store that energy from the sunlight to make it dispatchable for periods when the sun is not shining. And finally, electric transmission, in order to bring the power from the southwest, or from other sources, be they hydro sources, or hydro kinetic, ocean sources, wind sources, throughout the United States, to the customers and to the energy storage sources. The ``Solar Grand Plan'' assumes the deployment of a combination of thin film photovoltaic technologies, about percent, and thermal storage, thermal solar technologies, including thermal storage, about percent. These technologies have a proven record of reliability and safety, and that is what I want to emphasize, the ``Solar Grand Plan'' uses proven technologies that are in existence today. They are a little more expensive than traditional technologies, but they are proven. They do work. The production of solar energy is a function of the time of day, time of year, and cloud cover. We need to have storage to be able to mitigate those intermittencies to provide utilities with a tool to make consistent dispatchable electricity. Solar energy has been developed, the modules themselves, the solar collectors of the thermal solar systems have been developed to a very high degree of reliability. What we need now is an effort to provide that storage, and to link the storage elements together with transmission opportunities. One great reason that we would propose using compressed air energy storage is because it is under ground. It uses the same technologies as have been used to develop natural gas storage, and, in fact, only uses about percent of the capacity that has been used already to develop natural gas storage in the United States. Energy storage under the ground makes it more secure, makes the opportunity to have it widely disbursed, providing better opportunities for energy security in the United States in the future. Finally, the transmission component. In order to tie everything together, to make the opportunity to move electricity, just as we have in the United States with our interstate highway system, we need to have an interstate transmission system. This will probably be, while it is, again, one of the more technically, easily implemented elements, it will be probably the most challenging element from the standpoint of regulations and the ability and need to work together with stakeholders from states, at the federal level, and local level, to be able to implement putting in these right-of-ways for transmission systems. There are other technologies as well that need to be developed. The smart grid technologies, as we heard, are a very important part. They make the glue, if you will, to tie all the pieces together. But, much, again, of that work has been done already. These are nascent technologies, but they do exist. They are not far fetched, this is not non-existent technology. With all energy project proposals there is a price. This program should take, we estimate, about $ billion, but think of it as another opportunity, another alternative, to carbon collection and storage. As we start looking at alternatives towards our energy future, we need to weigh the different alternatives. Carbon collection and storage is one opportunity, but so we feel is also the ``Solar Grand Plan.'' And finally, the ``Solar Grand Plan'' strengthens our energy security by effectively storing electrical energy under ground, just as we have done with fuels at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and at natural gas storage facilities. And, just as it took the political will of Congress, with strong support from the states, to make the interstate highway system a reality, so it will take strong leadership, vision and the will of Congress, in partnership with the states, to make this become a long-term, reliable, sustainable, energy secure solution for our nation. Madam Chair, I thank you for the opportunity to visit with you today, and I look forward in the future to questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hansen follows:] Prepared Statement of Thomas N. Hansen Thank you very much Chairman Lampson, Vice Chair Giffords, Ranking Member Inglis and distinguished Members of the Committee and staff. My name is Tom Hansen and I am the Vice President of Environmental Services, Conservation and Renewable Energy for Tucson Electric Power, the second largest investor-owned electric utility in Arizona. We serve the energy needs of nearly , customers in the Tucson area. It is always a great honor and pleasure to work with the Members of Congress and their staff in exploring solutions to the energy challenges facing Americans today. The production of affordable, safe electricity from sustainable and secure sources in an environmentally appropriate manner is one of those challenges. I am here today to discuss with you one plausible solution to that challenge--a Solar Grand Plan. My background includes the design, construction, operation or management of over , MW of generation capacity, comprised primarily of nuclear and coal power plants. Many of my solar advocate friends claim I am serving my penance for that background by working with solar energy. But I am proud to have played a role in developing the electric generation infrastructure that has served our society so well for many decades and will play a significant role in providing needed electricity for at least the next twenty years. Moreover, my background in the development of those traditional electric generation assets has given me a unique insight into the technical and operational characteristics of the next generation of power producing technologies. While many energy resources are sustainable and environmentally neutral, only solar energy can supply all of our projected energy needs for the long-term future. Solar energy is abundant, ubiquitous, sustainable and sufficient to meet the total energy needs of the United States for centuries in the future. The January issue of Scientific American detailed a ``Solar Grand Plan'' that could realistically meet percent of U.S. electric needs by while reducing electricity related greenhouse gas releases by nearly percent. The same plan could satisfy percent of our nation's electric needs by . I am here today to discuss that plan with the Committee. My enthusiasm for the Solar Grand Plan will likely become obvious throughout the course of this testimony. Nevertheless, I should point out that my comments do not necessarily represent the views of Tucson Electric Power. TEP has earned widespread recognition for its innovative solar power programs, and the company is committed to expanding its use of renewable power resources. But TEP has not taken a position on this particular plan for solar power development. The Solar Grand Plan incorporates three core technologies that will be coordinated through smart grid technologies. The smart grid, which will be discussed in more detail later, would be a bi-directional quasi-real time communications and control system with interconnected energy sources, including traditional, wind, tidal, hydrokinetic, biomass and geothermal. It would connect with consumer electric devices--including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles--and incorporate predictive solar and wind forecasts of both short-and long-term time spans. While this system is incorporated in the Solar Grand Plan, the technology has enough flexibility to seamlessly integrate any traditional fueled or sustainable energy resource. The three core components of the Solar Grand plan are: Solar generation to refine the energy in the light rays of the sun into electricity. Energy storage to preserve energy from the sun or any other power source for later conversion into electricity. Electric transmission to link the solar generation and energy storage to consumers and their equipment. Discussion of each core component follows: Solar Generation: The solar generation component converts the energy of the sun's rays into the electric energy that will be stored or delivered to customers. Any of a wide variety of existing solar energy technologies will meet the requirements for this component of the Solar Grand Plan, as the final output of all solar electric technologies is effectively interchangeable. Fixed or tracking flat plate, crystalline or thin film photovoltaic (PV) modules with DC-to-AC inverters for interconnection to the electric grid are supported. Concentrating solar power (CSP) using trough, solar tower, dish/thermal engine, dish/PV engine or concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) technologies are all supported. Tucson Electric Power's solar development experience has demonstrated that deployment of a varied portfolio of solar technologies is needed for optimal solar generation economics, as each solar technology type is best suited for operation in a particular set of climatic conditions. For example: PV, which uses virtually no water in operation, is best suited to a geographic area with no access to water; solar trough technology, meanwhile, is appropriate for areas with readily available water and can be combined with desalination options to augment the local potable water supply. The Solar Grand Plan assumes the deployment of a combination of thin-film PV technologies ( percent of the total) and solar thermal with storage technologies ( percent of the total). Both technologies are commercially available and are in common use today, with a very good opportunity for future cost reductions. The solar generation technologies envisioned in the Solar Grand Plan have a proven record of reliability and safety. Future challenges for these technologies include reducing their cost through development of larger-scale U.S. located manufacturing facilities, optimizing the balance of system component costs and standardizing installation code requirements. Solutions to these challenges include an extension of the federal Investment Tax Credit for solar energy systems, expanded support for research and development of new solar energy conversion technologies at federal laboratories and universities, continued support for the Solar America Initiative program goals, and expanded federal programs for education and outreach to the American people regarding developments in solar energy product commercialization. Energy Storage: A core concept of the Solar Grand Plan is the need to store solar energy for use when the sun is not shining. By way of explanation, traditional electric generation is performed by technology that effectively refines a form of primary energy such as chemical energy in coal or nuclear energy in uranium into electricity. Instantaneous customer demand for electricity is met through the conversion of just the right amount of primary energy source to perfectly balance the supply of electrons with demand for those electrons at all times. A utility's ability to meet its customers' peak electric demand is a function of the maximum capacity built into the power plant. Production of solar energy--effectively refining the energy of the sun into electricity--is a function of time of day, time of year and cloud cover as well as capacity of the plant. The energy of the sun at the Earth's surface is not dispatchable, to use a traditional electric system term, as the utility has no direct control over increasing the sun's intensity. The addition of cost- effective, reliable, efficient, safe, environmentally compatible energy storage into a solar generation system would allow a utility to control output to support customer loads during times when the sun's energy is not available. Energy storage is needed on at least two different time scales: storing excess solar energy in one season for consumption a season or two later, and storage of daytime solar output for use at night. Numerous energy storage technologies exist today, but only two are suitable for utility scale use. One of them, pumped hydro storage, retains energy in the form of potential energy in water stored at a high elevation. The energy is released when the water is allowed to flow to a lower elevation through a traditional hydro generator. The other option, compressed air energy storage (CAES), retains potential energy in the form of high-pressure gas in an underground cavern or pore structure. While pumped hydro requires a specific set of geographic surface features and a supply of water, the underground conditions that would allow CAES are available in nearly every state in the union and often are used today for natural gas storage. The same technologies used for developing natural gas storage would support CAES development. The compressors that would tap excess solar generation to pump air underground are available today, as are the combustors and expansion turbines needed to convert the energy in compressed air to electricity. Such generators effectively would employ a split-shaft combustion turbine, thus relying on the same technology used to generate power from fossil fuels today. Two CAES plants are operational today with decades of operating experience, and other plants are in development for use in balancing the output of wind generation. The Solar Grand Plan requires a total underground storage volume of less than percent of the volume used today for storage of natural gas, a very feasible amount of underground development using existing technology. Surface disturbance area for CAES is very similar to that of natural gas storage, with an additional need for electric transmission access. Energy storage cycle efficiencies of CAES are around percent using existing technologies. While existing CAES technologies use some natural gas to reheat the air prior to conversion of the stored energy back to electricity, adiabatic expansion turbines can be developed that will not require the use of natural gas during energy recovery. A comparison of CAES characteristics with those of other energy storage technologies typically associated with solar energy, such as batteries or flywheels, is very favorable for CAES. Existing battery technologies typically can support a limited number of storage cycle before they must be replaced. Meanwhile, storage of energy from one season to another in batteries or flywheels generally results in additional storage cycle losses dependent upon the duration. CAES can store energy with minimal loss for extended time periods, and capacity does not degrade with an increasing number of charge/discharge cycles. Meeting all of the Nation's electric needs with solar power would require a sizable volume of energy storage to manage the seasonal and daily variations of solar energy production. While this storage could involve pumped hydro, flywheels, super-capacitors or superconductive magnetic energy storage (SMES), CAES enjoys a significant advantage in that it relies on deep underground facilities. This reduces its impact on land use, limits direct human interaction with the stored energy and mitigates risk from attack by enemies of our country. While the Solar Grand Plan can use any type of efficient, low-cost energy storage system, CAES was chosen due to its existing commercial availability, relatively low cost and proven reliability in utility scale applications. Thermal energy storage in molten salts, a relatively new technology incorporated in plans for thermal solar generation plants, could become part of the Solar Grand Plan's short-term storage component if its reliability and cost effectiveness prove comparable to those of CAES. Again, the Solar Grand Plan has sufficient flexibility to accommodate any new storage technology that can improve upon the reliability, efficiency, low environmental impact and cost effectiveness of CAES. Development of the energy storage system could be supported by federal Investment Tax Credits to reduce the effective initial cost to the owner of an energy storage facility; supportive capacity tariff rates from regional transmission organizations; and continued support of energy storage technology research and development, including additional funding for evaluation of geologic potential for CAES throughout the United States through the National Laboratories and universities. Favorable regulatory policy ensuring that the requirements of permitting a CAES facility are no more complex than permitting natural gas storage also would help reduce obstacles to development of the energy storage needed for the Solar Grand Plan. Transmission: The Solar Grand Plan includes a transmission component to collect and distribute the energy produced at the solar generation sites to the energy storage component and to energy-consuming customers throughout the Nation. The Solar Grand Plan does not specifically mention support for wind, biomass, hydro, tidal, current and other forms of sustainable energy production. Nevertheless, it would provide a national transmission backbone--similar in nature, if not in scope, to the National Interstate Highway system--capable of carrying energy from any generation source. The use of high-voltage DC lines for the Solar Grand Plan would leverage proven technologies to significantly reduce the risk of technical problems. However, the development of a national electricity backbone to enable the delivery of energy produced anywhere in the U.S. to any other part of the country will require the same sort of sustained political will that supported the -year effort to complete the Interstate Highway System. Policy development will need to address the concerns of property owners, regional and State development priorities and special interests. We must seek to forge a coordinated set of transmission development incentives that will ensure the full acquisition of the right-of-way required for completion of the transmission backbone in a timely manner. Funding will be needed for research analysis and development of the specific right-of-way alignment for the transmission backbone system. Strategic ``off-ramp'' locations for interconnection to existing regional and local transmission systems will need to be determined through extensive review and analysis of existing available transmission capacity. Cost-effective solutions for transmission bottlenecks to ensure efficient transfer of energy throughout the Nation will need to be found through additional analysis by National Laboratories and universities in cooperation with regional transmission organizations and electric utilities. All of the high-voltage DC transmission technology exists now to make the transmission backbone a reality. Nevertheless, development of a national electric transmission backbone will be the most difficult component of the Solar Grand Plan to implement because of the need to resolve a myriad of permitting and regulatory issues. Additionally, rules to allocate the system's costs to regions and various customer groups will have to be finalized prior to implementation of the transmission backbone. Technical advancements in high-temperature superconductors could make the regulatory challenges easier to resolve by providing an option for burying the transmission system underground in congested areas where overhead line extensions could be unacceptable. Federal Investment Tax Credits for companies investing in the transmission backbone would offer financial incentives for attracting investment in the transmission backbone system. Smart Grid: To maximize performance under the Solar Grand Plan, there is a need for a communications and control system to coordinate the solar generation, energy storage and transmission components. These so- called ``Smart Grid'' technologies include: advanced metering, meter database automation, quasi-real time bi-directional communications between customers and producers, direct load control, central distributed generation control and intelligent appliances. Customers will increasingly play a larger role in addressing the challenges of our energy future. Smart Grid technologies provide both customers and utilities with the tools to better manage the production, storage, delivery and use of electricity. In so doing, the Smart Grid changes the basic premise of electricity providers, transforming utilities from providers of am energy commodity to enablers of energy transactions. Under such circumstances, regulations to decouple commodity energy supply from utility revenue recovery will be an integral part of the development of the Solar Grand Plan. Innovative rate incentives could be developed to make effective use of a nationwide Smart Grid. For example, owners of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in New Jersey might be convinced to lend use of their cars' batteries to store solar energy produced in Arizona. Continued support of the National Laboratories for development and testing of Smart Grid technologies and development of transaction manager grid control algorithms will enable the Solar Grand Plan technologies to become reality. Other Considerations: The Solar Grand Plan requires the commitment of fairly large tracts of land for the installation of solar generation, energy storage and transmission. Transmission and CAES storage facilities would be spread out across the country, mitigating their environmental impact on any particular region. However, the solar generation component is expected to be concentrated in the southwestern U.S. to tap promising solar energy resources in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and California. This could create concerns about the environmental impact of large sections of land being effectively covered with solar collectors. Placing a large percentage of our nation's solar generation assets in one geographic area also makes them more susceptible to damage from a single weather related event. Distributing solar generation systems over a wider area may reduce that risk of damage. Funding should be made available for evaluation of optimum solar generation area coverage factors, heat island creation, environmental mitigation, wildlife habitat impacts and beneficial land uses in harmony with solar collectors. We also would need to consider the societal impact of bringing a significant number of solar equipment installers to live and work in currently uninhabited areas of the desert southwest. While the Solar Grand Plan envisions that most of our sustainable energy resources will be solar, the system would accommodate any generation resource--including our existing coal and gas fired power plants and nuclear facilities. As we transition to a new solar-based energy infrastructure, we must make accommodations for linking these existing resources into the national transmission backbone and incorporating their output into our energy storage plans. Financial Support: As with all energy project proposals, the Solar Grand Plan has a price. An estimated subsidy of $ billion would be needed to support development of plan components from to . After , the plan should be financially self-supporting as the cost of solar power with storage drops below the price of energy that could be generated from proposed traditional power plants. At that time, the Solar Grand Plan infrastructure would provide an economic alternative to construction of those new plants, and funds for continued expansion of the system would come from the sources traditionally used for new power plants today. A commitment to fund the solar generation portion of the Solar Grand Plan would encourage solar manufacturers to invest in new production factories in the United States. We will not fully reap the economic benefits of solar power development or achieve national energy security until the manufacturing of our basic energy Solar Grand Plan components occurs within this country. We will also not take full advantage of reducing our energy related expenses overseas if we are purchasing solar products produced in other nations. Conclusion: The Solar Grand Plan is proposed to demonstrate that there is at least one feasible, affordable, realistic plan based on proven existing technologies that can transition our fossil and nuclear energy based electric energy production infrastructure into a sustainable energy production infrastructure. It is instructive that the Interstate Highway System had an initial cost of $ billion in dollars, very close to the $ billion of subsidies that would be needed to bring the Solar Grand Plan into reality. The Solar Grand Plan strengthens our energy security by effectively storing electrical energy underground, as we have done with fuels at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and at natural gas storage facilities. Energy security is further enhanced by geographic dispersion of the energy storage facilities and through redundancy in the transmission backbone right-of-way alignments. Just as the construction materials and route alignments evolved during the -year construction of the Interstate Highway System, the Solar Grand Plan will benefit from advancements in technology and regulations during its development. And just as it took the political will of Congress with strong support from the states to make the Interstate Highway System a reality, strong leadership, vision and the will of Congress in partnership with the states will be essential to implementing a long-term, reliable, sustainable, secure energy solution for our nation. Chairman Lampson, Vice Chair Giffords, Ranking Member Inglis and distinguished Members of the Committee and staff, I want to thank your for this opportunity to address the Solar Grand Plan and for your dedication to finding solutions to the energy challenges facing our future.

KATE MARACAS, VICE PRESIDENT, ARIZONA OPERATIONS, ABENGOA SOLAR INC. Ms. Maracas. Thank you. Chairwoman Giffords, Members of the Committee, and staff, I, too, would like to express my appreciation for the opportunity to talk about this very important subject today. Thank you. I am the Vice President of Arizona Operations for Abengoa Solar, and we are a very large company based in Madrid, Spain. Abengoa employs over , people worldwide, and we have presence in more than countries. Right now, we have about people in the U.S. and Spain, who are dedicated to improving the technology and developing solar technology in the sunny southwestern states. In December of , last year, the U.S. Department of Energy selected us for three R&D projects aimed at improving solar parabolic trough technology, which you saw in Mr. Mehos' presentation. And recently, as we have already talked a little bit about, we have announced an agreement with Arizona Public Service to build, own and operate the megawatt CSP, or concentrating solar plant called Solana. APS will purchase all of the output of the plant, and I think as Congressman Mitchell already mentioned, if the plant were in operation today it would be the very largest in the world. So, with over megawatts of large-scale solar power plants in operation, development and construction in the U.S., Spain, Algeria, and Morocco, I think our company is notably one of the largest providers, leading providers of large-scale solar technology today. And, with that position in mind, we are grateful to be part of this important dialogue and discussing the role that CSP and other large-scale solar technologies can play in helping build our nation's energy resource portfolio. We will also be talking about the opportunities for removal of obstacles or barriers that could get in our way, and could otherwise prevent us from leveraging this very abundant resource, which as we heard comes in buckets from the sky. I like that analogy, I think it is a good one. I have been asked to address a few topics today, and they include, one, the efficacy of large-scale solar power as a significant component of the U.S. generation fleet, and barrier reduction opportunities for achieving this potential. Two, the near and long-term economic impacts of large-scale solar deployment. And third, the role of government in advancing solar thermal technologies. In the interest of time and efficiency, I will probably skip the third one, because I really cannot add anything to what Mr. Mehos has already commented, and I certainly concur with his remarks. On the subject of large-scale solar generation as a viable option for providing significant contributions to our power needs, my view is, certainly, that large-scale power facilities not only have the potential to become a leading part of our national resource portfolio, they are also among the smartest options that we can exercise, particularly, in a business-wise context. Further, I see today's family of CSP technologies as an important mainstream option for utility resource plans, and I will explain the reasons for those thoughts momentarily. Just one minute I will spend, before I get there, though, on the distinction in technologies. Mr. Mehos already pointed out some of the few, but the family of solar and thermal CSP technologies is growing rapidly and there is an increasing number of technologies that are becoming part of the solar thermal or CSP family. These technologies are advancing rapidly in the marketplace, but there are two basic categories of technology that I would like to distinguish. One is the category of photovoltaic or PV technologies, and those are the technologies that convert the sun's energy directly into electricity by virtue of a photo electric reaction that occurs on a semiconducting material. And, when a concentrating mechanism such as a lens is used on conjunction with those PV cells then we have a large-scale technology known as high concentration photovoltaics or ACPV, and this becomes a member of the utility-scale solar family, as I mentioned earlier, and you saw an illustration of one of those technologies on Mr. Mehos' slide. But, the solar thermal category, which is kind of the work horse of the large-scale family, is a bit different, in that it uses the sun's heat to produce steam, which in turn becomes the working agent in a conventional ranking cycle, the very familiar thermodynamic process that converts heat to energy in a common steam plant. So, this is very familiar, tried and true, mature technology. The significant difference between our kind of solar steam plant and natural goal or coal steam plants is that there is no fossil fuel combustion or associated carbon emission to use in creating the mechanical energy that in turn spins the turbine, and then transfers mechanical energy to an electric generator. So, most of my remarks today are with the large-scale solar technologies in mind. And then, returning to my comment that CSP is a business- wise decision, I can offer that at Abengoa Solar we talk with many, many utilities in our sunny southwestern and western states, and they are beginning to articulate large-scale solar in a different way. It is no longer just something that we have to do for compliance anymore. It is no longer something that our utility colleagues talk about as an R&D endeavor or an experiment, it is something that they consider a wise part of the their future resource planning options. When we talk about advanced coal technologies, which are not terribly mature yet today, and what are the other options that could compete as we are thinking about rapidly-growing demand in service areas, you probably will hear from Ms. Lockwood today about the rapid growth that APS is experiencing in our state. When you look at natural gas volatility risks, and the increasing likelihood of some kind of carbon regulation or carbon tax, then utilities are really beginning to think of it differently. Although, as Tom says, everything has a price, there is a slight premium today above conventional generation costs for CSP or large-scale solar generated electricity, but that cost gap is closing and I think Mark's slides illustrated that very well. As natural gas prices rise, as other costs go up, and as carbon regulation becomes more imminent the gap is closing. Our costs will come down. Utilities are increasingly viewing CSP as a wise bet against fuel price volatility and open-ended carbon liability. APS, our first large-scale CSP customer in the U.S., has, in fact, been very, very forward thinking about the role that CSP will play in their future resource portfolio, and I will let Barbara talk about that in just a little bit. But, I will say that APS has really been a leader among a group of very proactive utilities who are thinking about this in a very different way today. And, the final portion of this first topic that I have been asked to address relates to those barriers that could stand in the way of large-scale solar deployment, and I will just be very simplistic about this. In my mind, there is no barrier whatsoever related to technology. Yes, indeed, there is room for improvements in cost, and performance, and efficiency, and R&D should continue, but in terms of will technology be the barrier that prevents us from going forward, it most definitely will not. In my view, the greatest barrier to increased deployment of solar generating facilities is, indeed, political rather technical, and you know where I am going with this, I am going to be talking about the ITC, the lack of an enduring tax credit, the percent solar investment tax credits that we have talked about briefly already, is really the biggest hindrance that we see today in large-scale solar. The ITC has been in place since the passage of the Energy Policy Act in , but it has, since its enactment it has really just been kept on life support with one or two-year extensions at a time. As Mark said, these one or two-year extensions do large- scale projects really no good, in fact, they do a disservice, because it prevents us from developing a longer extension through Congress that could help create the certainties that capital markets need to lend money on these large projects. The duration of one or two years, which is shorter than the project development time for a large-scale solar plant, means that we really must see a long-term extension, at least eight years of the ITC, in order for this industry to move forward. As Congressman Mitchell mentioned, we have been very candid about the fact that the Solana Generating Station in the Gila Bend area of Arizona cannot happen without it, without the eight-year extension. So, for these reasons I guess I will just say, ITC, ITC, ITC over and over again, and I would urge Congress to extend this important measure for an eight-year period, through bipartisan support of the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of which passed through the House last month. On the subject of near and long-term economic impacts of large-scale solar deployment, I can draw observations from a very large body of credible research that has been done over the last several years on this topic, and I will speak as a member of the Western Governors' Solar Task Force--or the Western Governors' Association Solar Task Force, as a member of that group I participated in a comprehensive effort to analyze the role that solar energy could play in helping the Governors meet an ambitious goal of deploying , megawatts of clean energy in their states by . So, our task was to understand what is the actual resource potential, what is the market potential, how does that match up with demand for energy, what is the industry's capability to gear up and build projects and deliver energy through solar resources, and also to understand the barriers to deployment, and then finally, what will this effort pay back in terms of economic benefits. On the topic of economic impact, we examined over a dozen economic studies that had been done since , all by credible investigators, State governments, national labs, universities. In fact, three of those studies were supported by Mark's institution, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and these three looked specifically at CSP, Concentrating Solar Power plants, and in a variety of different scenarios and assumptions about different growth patterns, and sizes of deployments and so on, they looked at what would be the impacts in terms of private investment in the state, permanent and temporary job creation, indirect and direct effects, and so on. And, we convened--these studies were conducted for Nevada, for New Mexico, and for southern California, and so the assumptions were all different, as I mentioned, different sizes of economies, and different scales and so on, in order to just understand, in a general sense, what does CSP or large-scale solar deployment really mean, in terms of just kind of generalization across the board, what does one gigawatt, , megawatts of CSP actually do to our economies. So, we convened an expert panel of economists to generalize these impacts, and our findings were that for every gigawatt of CSP added to the state's economy the deployment would yield $ to $ billion of private investment in the state, , to , construction jobs, and up to permanent solar plant jobs, many of those in rural areas where we typically are trying to attract economic development, a $ . to $ . billion, -year increase in tax revenues, and that is after any tax incentives or other incentives are given to the project developers, and between $ and $ billion in increased gross State product. And so, a general rule of thumb for one gigawatt of CSP. These are enormous positive impacts that can occur. Clearly, the findings indicated that the broader incorporation of large-scale solar plants into the U.S. generation fleet, not only produces those economic impacts, but also the benefits of sustainability and energy independence, as Mr. Hansen spoke about. Finally, on the role of government advancing solar technologies, as I said, I will defer. I think those points have already been made very well. I will say that the thing that government can do for this technology, in addition to what Mr. Mehos mentioned, and issues that will help us site and facilitate permitting, solve transmission congestion problems and so on, we have to help CSP learn to walk on its own, and, in fact, we very much hope it learns to run. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Maracas follows:] Prepared Statement of Kate Maracas Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Giffords, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today.

Abengoa employs over , people worldwide, with presence in more than countries. Abengoa Solar has a team of approximately people in the United States and Spain dedicated to researching, developing and improving solar technologies. In December , the U.S. Department of Energy selected Abengoa Solar for three research and development projects to improve solar parabolic trough technology. And recently, we announced an agreement with Arizona Public Service to build, own and operate a Megawatt (MW) Concentrating Solar Power, or ``CSP'' plant in western Arizona. APS will purchase all of the output of the plant, known as the Solana Generating Station. If in operation today, Solana would be the largest solar power plant in the world. With over MW of large-scale solar power plants in operation, development, and construction stages in the U.S., Spain, Morocco, and Algeria, Abengoa Solar is notably one of the world's leading providers of large-scale solar technology solutions today. With that position in mind, we are especially grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this important dialogue about the role that CSP and other large scale solar technologies can play in our nation's energy resource portfolio, and the opportunities for removing obstacles that could prevent us from leveraging our very abundant and sustainable solar resource. I have been asked to address a few topics today, and they include: ( ) The efficacy of large-scale solar power as a significant component of the U.S. generation fleet, and barrier reduction opportunities for achieving this potential; ( ) Near- and long-term economic impacts of large-scale solar deployments; and ( ) The role of government in advancing solar thermal technologies. I will attempt to address these topics, in that same order. On the subject of large-scale solar generation as a viable option for providing significant contributions to our nation's power needs, my view is that large-scale solar power facilities not only have the potential to become a meaningful part of our national resource portfolio; they are also among the smartest options we can exercise-- particularly in a business-wise context. Further, I see today's family of CSP technologies as an important ``mainstream'' option for utility resource plans. I will explain the reasons for those thoughts momentarily, and before I do, a brief discussion about the distinction between large-scale solar generation and CSP in particular is worthwhile. The family of solar thermal and CSP technologies is growing rapidly. An increasing number of technology approaches to solar thermal generation is advancing in the market place. I would like to clarify that there are two very basic categories of solar electricity generation. One is the category of photovoltaic, or ``PV'' technologies--those that convert the sun's energy directly to electricity by virtue of a photo-electric reaction that occurs on a semi-conducting material. When a concentrating mechanism such as a lens is used in conjunction with PV cells, the technology is known as High Concentration Photovoltaics, or ``HCPV.'' Because the lenses add great efficiency to the PV cells' production capacity, HCPV is currently being developed as a utility-scale solar option. The solar thermal category is a bit different, in that it uses the sun's heat to produce steam, which in turn becomes the working agent in a conventional Rankine Cycle--the very familiar thermodynamic process that converts heat to energy in a common steam power plant. The significant difference is that a solar thermal plant requires no fossil fuel combustion or associated carbon emissions to create the mechanical energy that spins a turbine, which in turn transfers mechanical energy to an electric generator. Most of my remarks today contemplate thermal CSP technologies, although Abengoa Solar also views HCPV as a very promising technology in the near horizon. Returning to my comment that CSP is a ``business-wise'' decision, I can offer that Abengoa Solar Inc. holds discussions with many utilities in our sunny western and southwestern states, and an increasing number of our utility contacts articulate that they no longer view CSP as just an option for Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) compliance, or as an experimental R&D endeavor. Rather, our utility colleagues consider their future resource planning options in the context of advanced coal technology and emission constraints, natural gas price volatility risks, and the increasing likelihood of carbon emission costs in the form of externalities or direct taxation. Although there is a slight premium today above conventional generation costs for CSP-generated electricity, the cost gap is closing as fossil fuel prices increase and carbon regulation becomes more imminent. With today's promise of dispatchable solar plants made available through advanced commercialization of Solar Thermal Energy Storage (TES) technology, utilities increasingly view CSP as a wise bet against fuel price volatility and open-ended carbon liability. Arizona Public Service, our first large-scale CSP customer in the U.S., has in fact been very forward thinking about the role of CSP in their future resource portfolio. APS is a leader among a group of proactive utilities in our nation who very definitely view CSP as a viable part of a low-risk resource portfolio, and as a mainstream element of their growing generation fleet. The final portion of this topic that I have been asked to address relates to those barriers that may stand in the way of large-scale solar deployments. There is no question in my mind that technology is not a barrier. While there is room for cost and performance improvements that will occur with technology advancements, economies of scale, repetition and associated learning curve improvements, the greatest barrier to increased deployment of solar generating facilities is indeed political rather than technical. While federal support of R&D must continue, the single most significant hindrance to broader deployments of CSP facilities in the U.S. is the lack of an enduring tax credit which is essential to the financial viability of CSP installations today. The percent federal Investment Tax Credit, or ``ITC,'' has been in place since passage of the Energy Policy Act . But since its enactment it has been kept on life support with one- or two-year reauthorizations at a time. The short lifespan of the ITC does not stimulate the deployment of large, capital-intense solar generating stations, which require three to four years to build. Further, the large institutional entities required to provide construction and operating capital for these projects cannot operate with the uncertainty of an expiring tax credit whose duration is shorter than a project development period. In summary, are there technology improvements to be achieved for large-scale solar through R&D? Absolutely. Are the barriers to meeting more of our nation's energy needs through solar energy production related to technology? Absolutely not. The single most important barrier to achieving our solar potential is the lack of a policy framework that is sufficiently robust to stimulate solar deployments in a meaningful way. We, our industry colleagues, and our consumers urge Congress to extend the federal ITC for an eight year period through bipartisan support of the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of that passed in the House last month. On the subject of near- and long-term economic impacts of large- scale solar deployments, I can draw observations from a large body of credible research that has been done over the last several years. As a member of the Western Governors Association's Solar Task Force, I participated in a comprehensive effort to analyze the role that solar energy could play in helping the Governors meet their goal of deploying , MW of clean energy in their states by the year . Our task was to understand the resource potential, the market potential, the industry's capacity, the barriers to deployment, and the economic impacts that would result. On the latter topic, we examined over a dozen economic studies conducted since by credible investigators such as universities, national laboratories, and State governments. In fact, three of those studies, supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) examined the economic impacts that could be expected as a result of increased deployment of CSP plants in particular. The studies contemplated a variety of CSP plant growth and scale scenarios, and the changes to be expected in terms of job creation, net Treasury gains, Gross State Product, and private investment. We convened an expert panel of economists to generalize these impacts across different State economies, and across different assumptions used among the studies. Our findings were that for every one Gigawatt (GW) of CSP added to a state's economy, the deployment would yield:\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ The assumptions here are: GA state economy (GSP) of $ B (a median range --------------------------------------------------------------------------- across states); GOnly direct jobs--no manufacturing or other indirect jobs are considered here; GInvestment represents only direct capital associated with the plant and assets; GGSP increase includes indirect and induced effects. $ -$ billion private investment in state; , - , construction jobs; up to permanent solar plant jobs, many in rural areas; $ . -$ . billion -yr. increase in State tax revenues; and $ -$ billion increase in Gross State Product. Those figures represent net effects, even after any tax credits or economic incentives are utilized to stimulate industry development. Clearly, the findings show that broader incorporation of large-scale solar plants into the U.S. generation fleet not only produces the benefits of sustainability and energy independence, it also pays back in very significant, positive economic impacts. Finally, on the role of government in advancing solar thermal technologies, it is clear that the private sector cannot achieve a ``Grand Solar Plan'' alone. The market penetration of any new technology, product, or service traditionally follows a pattern of growth in market adoption, followed by declining prices and higher margins that result from economies of scale. Large-scale solar generation is no different in that regard. What is different, however, is that the capital commitments required to bring large-scale solar plants to market are very large, and the risk of investing in such markets with the hope that demand will follow is too high for private sector entities to bear alone. This condition describes the very traditional role that government has played in numerous examples of infrastructure development and market stimulation actions. The government's role in solar power thus far has been both push and pull. By that I imply that the creation of demand for clean solar energy in the market place must come from both mandates and incentives. Twenty six states, including Arizona, now have Renewable Portfolio Standards that require increasing portions of delivered electricity to be derived from renewable energy resources. The RPS frameworks are a very good start, but only speak to half of the push-pull equation. Governments must also step up to the plate to incentivize market activity, and so I repeat here that a vitally important role for the Federal Government will be to extend the ITC for eight years so that large solar power plants can be financed and be economically viable. Recalling my comparison to other new technologies, products, and services in the marketplace, CSP will also grow up and learn to walk on its own. On a final note, I will comment that we are very pleased to see the serious commitment to solar energy R&D that both the President and Congress have demonstrated in recent years. While I noted earlier that technology itself is not a barrier to large-scale solar power production, the efficiency and performance improvements that will be accomplished through R&D will continue to be an important part of ongoing cost reductions that will help large-scale solar generation to walk on its own. In fact, we hope it learns to run. Thank you very much for the opportunity to share our perspective on this important topic.

Thank you, Ms. Maracas. Ms. Rauluk, please. STATEMENT OF MS. VALERIE RAULUK, FOUNDER AND CEO, VENTURE CATALYST INC. Ms. Rauluk. Thank you, Madam Chair, Chairman Gordon, and distinguished Members of the Committee, Representatives Lipinski, Matheson, Mitchell, and Ranking Minority Leader Hall. I would also like to thank my colleagues regarding the insights I will share with you. Please note that Venture Catalyst is solely responsible for the opinions expressed. Thanks to Arizona Research Institute for Solar Energy, AzRISE, the University of Arizona, Joe Simmons and Ardeth Barnhardt, my colleagues at Sun Edison, Jigar Shah, Howard Green, Colin Murchie, and my colleagues at Raytheon Missile Systems, John Waszczak and Thomas Olden. Venture Catalyst has been engaged in commercialization of solar energy technology for the last ten years, primarily, under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, Sandia National Labs, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We have also worked with regional and national solar energy companies in thermal and photovoltaic technologies, from residential to utility-scale markets. Although fundamentally agnostic when it comes to solar technologies, I will address specific preferences based on risk factors and maximized benefits. Here is what I hope to cover, opportunities, obstacles, critical factors in the first years. The ``Grand Solar Plan'' is possible with the right investment structure and technology portfolio. The path to progress for achieving that goal is a going-forward focus on Distributed Solar Photovoltaic, DGPV, I hope to use that, DGPV, throughout here. Given the dominance of PV in the ``Grand Solar Plan'' and the , megawatts of solar thermal projects in the pipeline, a similar commitment to PV should be made. At present, megawatts of PV have been cumulatively developed. But most importantly, the DGPV focus offers the greatest flexibility for resolving the biggest obstacle to achieving the plan financing. Strategically targeted DGPV development offers all of the investor groups the best return on their investment, especially, the rate payers, and I am going to talk about that in a little more detail in a minute. A couple critical factors for success on the path to progress. First of all, productively framing the concept of utility-scale solar. The second, continuing technical improvements, and third, structuring the investment for fairness and maximized benefit. I want to talk a little bit about the different technologies and the different formats. You have already seen the difference between PV and solar thermal, I want to go into that. There is two major development formats for solar energy. One is the central station format, and the other is the distributed format. This is an example of solar thermal projects, which because of economies of scale limitations are to date developed in large-scale central station format. The title of this image is ``Perfection.'' This is one of the many formats that solar photovoltaic projects can take, a utility-scale project in a distributed generation DG format. It does not require transmission and the associated costs considered connected to the distribution part of the electric power grid. Strategically located PV installations within the distribution grid can provide benefits above and beyond the value of clean green peak power, benefits that can extend the life of power infrastructure and increase the reliability of the local grid. This is another picture of that same installation of an . megawatt in southern Colorado, and you can see the substation in the background there. Here is another way to deploy DGPV, and it has actually been the major development mode for PV to date, and that is roof-top installation. I would like to offer the following definition of utility- scale solar energy and call out the key factors, large scale, lower cost, higher reliability, and benefits across customer classes. Here are a couple examples, two to megawatt solar farms strategically located in the low pockets, one to five megawatt solar farms on the roof tops of schools, reducing school energy expenditures, and putting solar energy into the grid in the summertime for the rest of the community, and also, of course, the one to five megawatts in commercial government installations, similar to what I showed you before. Critical factor , solar energy technology is ready right now. You have heard that from several of the speakers. PV, in particular, has, and continues to achieve, incremental improvements across the entire value chain. Additionally, major advances are coming out of Arizona laboratories in the next three to -year term, specifically, in the area of PV, concentrated PV, or CPV, and high-concentrated PV, or HCPV. A solar focus on the PV family of technologies will help harvest additional economic benefits for Arizona and Arizona rate payers, and you will have to pardon my specific interest in Arizona. A major obstacle to PV deployment has been the conflict with preserving utility revenues. By means of both product design and regulatory rules and policy, the industry is actively addressing this conflict. A commitment to large-scale DGPV programs would accelerate the resolution. Financing, financing, as I have said, is a major obstacle to making this happen. We are asking the Federal Government, and local government, private capital, and, most importantly, the rate payers, from whence the utility renewable energy investment dollars comes from, are all the people involved in this transaction. We are asking rate payers, I think this is the most important thing that you need to think about as we structure this, we are asking rate payers to contribute to solar energy investment at the same time they are being asked to pay for fossil fuel increases. By developing many solar projects across numerous communities, more rate payers will experience the direct benefits of economic development and increased power security and reliability. PV, CPV, HCPV, because of greater scalability, flexibility, and modularity, can be deployed more easily across a range of situations. Regulatory obstacles, we know what has to be done, and have developed and implemented best practices in key regional U.S. markets. We need to nationalize those practices for a more rational and effective market. I would concur with many of the things that people have said already, the ITC is very important, and nationalizing some of these best practices is very important as well. Incentive design, in general we need to reallocate our incentives away from fossil fuel and to solar energy, and we know there are some best practices on how to design that. So, for the first years, my recommendation is reallocate investment to the highest benefit, lowest-risk installations, and that is DGPV, and to aggregate smaller projects in a systematic program to reduce risk while delivering the cost of scale. And, I believe that this will effectively stretch public investment, and it will reduce performance and project risk. In the second five years, I would see that we would integrate higher-volume concentrated PV and high-concentrated PV as the cost effectiveness and reliability of those technologies come on line, and begin a second phase of solar thermal development if feasible or necessary. So, in conclusion, the path to progress for the Grand Solar Plan, make balanced, judicious, timely technology choices, structure the investment for fairness and efficiency across all of the investment groups, and match the , megawatt solar thermal projects in process with , megawatts of photovoltaic projects. Thank you for this opportunity to testify, and thank you for your leadership in this critical issue, and especially, Chair, Congresswoman Giffords, I really appreciate your leadership here. It has made a very big difference in Arizona. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Rauluk follows:] Prepared Statement of Valerie Rauluk Madame Chairman, Members of the Committee, distinguished guests I am honored to offer my testimony concerning Utility Scale Solar Power. My comments will address the following: . Grand Solar Plan as a viable option. The technical & regulatory obstacles. . Current solar energy market and expected changes over the next years. . Current regulatory environment and incentive structures conducive to large scale solar development & recommended improvements. . Distributed PV and concentrating PV compared with solar thermal technology. Areas of government research that can play a critical role not met by private sector. Other recommendations and priorities. . The Grand Solar Plan as a viable option. The technical & regulatory obstacles. The Grand Solar Plan calls out a vision of nearly percent of our electricity generation from solar energy by . It also calls for a technology mix of five times as much solar photovoltaic (``PV'') as solar thermal. This vision is highly probable, with the right development framework and investment incentives. Additionally, the Grand Solar Plan calls out for a development format of large-scale remote solar energy generation, compressed air storage, and direct current transmission. My colleagues at the University of Arizona have convinced me that compressed air storage and direct current transmission are more than science fiction, although there is much that needs to be assessed for both approaches to be viable. It is important to note that designing, financing and implementing a large-scale adoption of such strategies is no minor feat. As such, I would see, from my experience and understanding of technology adoption cycles, that such approaches will not be available for commercial adoption for or more years. Other witnesses could clarify the risks, timing and benefits better than I. Beginning the process of assessing and designing such approaches is useful, but I would caution that we focus on the approaches that can deliver large amounts of market driven solar generation into the mix quickly, with the lowest risk and the greatest benefits. As you will see, my comments focus on the first ten years of a Grand Solar Plan. The first steps will be difficult. Large amounts of investment capital from public and private sectors will be needed. And the skeptics concerning solar energy and its primary role in the greening and cleaning of our energy system will be numerous and loud. That is why in the first years, we should focus on efforts that lower risk and maximize the benefits. In addressing the technical and regulatory obstacles to achieving the Grand Plan the following critical factors will be addressed. Critical Factor # --Productively framing the definition of ``utility scale solar'' and supporting with regulatory requirements. Critical Factor # --Technology improvements, including improvements in business model. Critical Factor # --Effectively structuring the multi-billion dollar investment to be made by rate-payers, investors and the government. Critical Factor # --Productively framing the definition of ``utility scale solar'' and supporting with regulatory requirements Although the Grand Solar Plan does not make specific recommendations regarding the development format, it seems to imply, with the recommendation for large scale storage and specialty transmission, that solar energy should be developed under the model of the last years: large scale, remotely located, dependent on extensive transmission for delivery to consumers. This is commonly referred to as the ``central station'' model. There is a more market driven way to develop solar energy and the successes of the last few years highlight the approach. That approach consists of smaller generation facilities, on otherwise unused real estate (roof-tops and sites of to acres of land, two percent to percent of a square mile), located near the load demand, and dispersed throughout many communities. That approach is called distributed generation or ``DG.'' DG is not only a path of more rapid, less risky development, it is also the path for a more robust power network. There is an inherent resiliency in networked systems where resources are at the point of use (like the Internet) instead of a hub and spoke development (like the land-line telephone system). This resiliency can be enhanced with the addition of small scale, on-site intelligent controls and storage, increasing reliability and dependability and improving the fit between resource generation and needs across the local grid. When developed in a strategic and coordinated fashion, DG can delay or eliminate the need for distribution and transmission infrastructure investment. Although DG includes very small generating systems, much larger DG systems (up to MW in a single location) can be clearly characterized as ``utility scale'' as can a systematic aggregation of many smaller generators. Utility scale can be more productively thought of as any project/program offering high volume, lower-cost, reliable, and dependable renewable energy for years plus at fixed prices for large numbers of customers. Utilizing this more expansive definition of utility scale offers more options for maximizing solar energy deployment at the best cost-benefit trade-off, starting now. Examples are: to MW solar farms, strategically located in load pockets to strengthen the grid and increase community energy security in case of transmission failure. to MW solar farms on the roofs of our schools, reducing school budget exposure to volatile and rising energy prices for years and pumping solar power into the grid for community use during the summer days when community demand is most pressing. kW to multiple megawatts on commercial, government, industrial sites/buildings. In Arizona alone, an immediate potential of multiple gigawatts of solar energy systems are available. With expected cost reductions, GW of solar energy could be developed in the U.S. over the next ten years (U.S. Department of Energy. Solar America Initiative, http:// www .eere.energy.gov/solar/solar - america/). Central station development has its attractions. It feeds into the `bigger is better' syndrome. Bigger means more attention. Bigger means larger development fees. Usually bigger means cheaper. But what a great deal of research has shown, is that bigger, especially when it comes to power plants, can often be riskier: longer construction periods, higher financing cost, longer delays before a system is producing and selling energy to end-users, to name just a few. Bigger also usually means more remotely located from where the consumers are, a distance that results in additional costs for transmission: wheeling charges, transmission investment and public approval (nobody seems to want transmission lines in their backyards), and transmission losses. And last, but not least the security exposure of having a critical resource like power, vulnerable to hundreds of miles of difficult to protect delivery infrastructure. Removing the Obstacles Since nearly all of our existing power generation is central station, and a considerable amount of central station solar power is in the early stages of development, our focus going forward should be to diversify our resource portfolio and focus on solar DG installations. Regulatory Regulatory obstacles to this path are fairly straightforward and in fact, many states have established law, policy and procedure to remove them. That is how MW of solar energy got developed last year. But the patchwork has prevented a truly vibrant and efficient market for solar energy. Efforts at the federal level to establish the following best practices will accelerate the development of solar energy. Level the playing field for incentives, subsidies and financing Establish incentives at the federal level that match the incentives given to fossil fuels. Structure for rapid and long-term deployments with declining levels of support to encourage systematic and focused cost reduction across the whole value chain. Reward system performance and support system diversity, Net Metering Require full retail value for all solar energy produced by customers without restrictions on size, or special fees and tariffs. Standard & Fair Interconnection Standards to the Grid Interconnection standards set the rules and fees for connecting a customer generator to the grid. The standard should encourage the development of customer systems, while maintaining the safety and integrity of the grid. A fair and reasonable standard has been broadly vetted and adopted in the leading renewable energy states and should be adopted nation-wide. Solar Fair & Friendly Rates & Utility Revenue Practices Properly designed rates can support investment in solar energy and wise use while maintaining utility profits. Critical Factor # --Technology improvements, including improvements in business model Technical Cost and efficiency, especially of components have been perennial obstacles to widespread use of solar energy. Both of those concerns have been and are being addressed with incremental improvements. In addition, major improvements are possible in the in the six- to -year time frame as research and development initiatives currently in process begin focused commercialization. Two areas of consideration that have not received as much attention in the past are storage strategies and intelligent control technologies that facilitate integration of renewable energy into the grid. Storage is important for solar energy. It expands its flexibility by extending access to the power produced during sunlight hours. Storage schemes can be grand and large, like compressed-air energy storage. Because of scale and site limitation this approach is not being actively integrated into deployment projects. Other forms of storage such as flow batteries, inverter based micro storage, and flywheels are being considered. The storage industry is currently at a stage of development very similar to where PV was less than years ago. Low volume market demand has meant low volume manufacturing and all of the cost premiums that entails. Properly incentivized storage options will bring investment and scale to its manufacture with the concomitant cost reduction. From the perspective of solar energy deployment in the near- term, these forms of storage should receive both research and incentive support, while core research continues on large scale, big bite strategies that will not be functionally available for five to ten years. Intelligent controls are especially useful to maximize the potential benefits of DG deployment to the grid. Such controls could allocate generation resources across a distribution node to maximize value. Many of these controls are inverter based and would require software and minor hardware additions and modifications, a low cost solution with significant benefits. In addition to technical changes (including modifications of UL ), these benefits could be best achieved through a development mechanism of aggregating individual DG sites. There are some fundamental business model improvements that need to be made to integrate DG into the existing utility business model in a way that protects revenues and existing asset base. Technical Improvements in business model One of the most important innovations supporting rapid deployment of solar energy has been the technical advance in business models. The solar industry's explosive growth in the last few years has been directly related to the development and use of the solar power purchase agreement (PPA). In over percent of the national nonresidential market for solar electric power was developed under PPAs, up from percent in (``Solar Power Services: How PPAs are changing the PV Value Chain,'' Greentech Media, February, ). The solar PPA essentially finances the up-front capital cost and offers customers the output from PV systems at or below the cost of fossil fuel generation. The solar PPA developer monetizes the federal and local tax credits, facilitates utility incentives and renewable energy credit sales, and designs and implements all business processes to minimize and absorb the risk that the customer would otherwise be forced to assume. These risks include: financial, technology, system performance, construction and regulatory. With discipline and innovation, PPA developers have improved and enhanced the solar photovoltaic transaction across the entire value chain, bringing greater profitability and lower prices to the market place. It was this customer-centric focus, at a time when customers were reeling from rate increases and pricing volatility that resulted in such an expansion of system installations. The solar PPA using PV technology, offers two financial risk reduction strategies for customers: capital acquisition and future price protection. Under the solar PPA, the developer monetizes all of the incentives and tax credits and through aggregation, secures private sector project financing. Because of the nature of PV technology, especially minimal operations and maintenance requirements once installed, and long-term predictable performance output (PV panels have warranties of years), PV can offer firm prices under contract for years. This means an effective -year hedge against rising fossil fuel prices for the customer. It is this hedge against rising electric power prices fueled by resources with uncertain and volatile pricing that has made the PV PPAs so successful. The next generation of solar PPAs, currently entering the market continues this customer-centric focus, but with the addition of utility-centric features. The recent success of solar thermal technologies in the market place ( , MW of solar thermal contracts have been initiated with construction expected to be complete in the next three years) highlights the importance of utility-centric features. Solar thermal is a traditional steam turbine electric power generation process, fueled primarily by solar collectors instead of coal, natural gas or nuclear reaction. The familiarity helps many utility executives more readily consider the solar thermal option. But since the approach incorporates a traditional power block, it shares many of the risks and inefficiencies of indirect, multi-stage conversions of energy: large scale, remote location, transmission dependent, multi-year construction, and big impact financing, performance, and operation risks. For these reasons and more, it is not a technology choice and a development approach that can be relied upon to deliver large volume, rapid deployment of solar energy in the first phase. Large scale, strategic, and multi-year development of solar energy in the distributed generation format, especially in the next year period is essential for achieving the goals of Grand Plan for Solar Energy. Solar energy is a disruptive technology. Disruptive technologies by definition create risk. But disruptive technologies, like the automobile that replaced the horse and buggy, can offer massive improvements in quality of life and prosperity. What mitigates that risk and transforms it into opportunity is the right technology of doing business, the right business model. Such a model must be both customer-centric and utility-centric. Utility revenue and the remaining life of the massive investment made by investors and rate-payers in conventional generation, power distribution and transmission assets must be protected and maximized as best possible while incorporating solar technologies. But not at the expense of future competitiveness and resiliency. A major obstacle to massive solar energy deployment, in addition to cost and efficiency, has been conflict. Innovations in the solar PPA, coupled with other innovations in power financing entering the marketplace, are designed to end the current conflict between distributed generation and utility revenue protection while establishing more effective and fair financing for rate-payers. It is in our interest to end the conflict. Much can be gained from strategic deployment of DG: improved system reliability, reduction or elimination of transmission & distribution expenditures, reduction of local congestion, voltage support, low cost to no cost for non-participants, and reduced subsidies. Deploying and integrating generators, smart meters and intelligent controls, energy efficiency, virtual net metering, green tariffs and effective storage will permit greater control of load and generation. It is important to note how great the need is for strengthening and hardening our power grid. ``. . .the United States has three times as many power outages of the United Kingdom and over times as many power outages of Japan. Both Japan and the United Kingdom have achieved this reliability in part by investing in st century distributed generation technologies-distributed solar, combined heat and power, fuel cells, energy efficiency measures, and other customer-centric market solutions. (as quoted in ``The Materiality of Distributed Solar, ``Jigar Shah, Apt, Jay & Lave, Lester & Morgan, M. Granger. ( ). Power Play: A More Reliable U.S. Electric System. Issues in Science & Technology. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi I qa / is I /ai I n ) Finally, just as ``simple, easy'' is a useful guiding principle for technologies and technology systems, it is a good design principle for business models as well. ``Solar PPA . '' can reduce and eliminate the need for complex and copious regulations, mandates and other policy requirements. Critical Factor # --Effectively structuring the multi-billion dollar investment that will be made by rate-payers, investors and the government. The solar energy investment envisioned by the Grand Solar Plan is significant and such an investment should be fair to all investors and maximize both direct and indirect benefits. Because solar energy financing consists of several mechanisms: tax advantages, utility sector incentives payments, and private capital different investor groups are coordinated in the transaction. Fairness would recommend that all investors receive benefits that justify the investment made. The federal investment for solar is no different than investments made over the last years for general public access to energy and electric power. From to $ billion was spent by the Federal Government for support to nuclear power, $ . billion; solar energy, $ . billion; and wind, $ . billion. (``Federal Energy Subsidies: Not All Technologies are Created Equal,'' Marshall Goldberg, Renewable Energy Policy Project, Research Report July , No. ). Clearly, for solar energy to become more broadly available, restructuring of the federal energy investment must be made. The rate-payer contribution is the area of greatest concern for assuring fairness. At the current level of financing for a residential rate-payer, usually less than $ per year, when some rate-payers benefit more than others, although contributing benefits for all, there is less need for concern. But for the kind of investment that the Grand Solar Plan would entail, spreading the benefits across all rate-payer classes and all communities is crucial. The DG development approach can distribute the benefits across a broader range of rate-payers and communities. But the fairness issue still remains. Not all rate-payers are in a position to invest in solar energy systems even with the tax credits and utility incentives available. The new funding mechanisms must be designed so that those who can directly benefit, contribute greater investment. Recent developments in PPAs for the DG market can increase the fairness, if the directive to support utility scale coordinated DG development is made. . The current marketplace for solar energy and expected evolution. The current solar energy market has been dominated by DG deployment of PV, although , MW of solar thermal projects are expected to be built in the next few years. PV deployment over the next five years is conservatively projected to increase percent annually. Worldwide deployment was just under GW and is expected to increase to GW by . US deployments of approximately MW (SEIA as reported by the Wall Street Journal / / ) are conservatively expected to grow in excess of percent annually (internal proprietary analysis). The U.S. market is commonly considered to be the next high growth solar market, anticipating greater consolidation of political will and the necessary regulatory framework at the U.S. federal level. PV is on track for delivering promised cost reductions. Incremental improvements in silicon pricing, silicon utilization and overall system costs are expected to decrease annually at a consistent, but modest level. This is independent of any major game changing technology or manufacturing process coming on-line. There are cost, performance and manufacturing processing improvements in the pipeline, but it is uncertain when, and at what scale they will enter the marketplace. Commercialization is a highly uncertain process and although it is clear that more attention and investment has been directed toward PV improvements across the entire value chain, it is unclear how soon those improvements will be translated into value. The Grand Plan calls out thin film and expected cost reductions. In general, I am in agreement, though my colleagues at University of Arizona have pointed out some of the fundamental resource issues from both a supply and a toxicity perspective, with the cadmium telluride cells. They and others are working on next generation materials with great promise that avoid supply and toxicity concerns, but again, there are uncertainties concerning time to market. The greatest concern in the next three to five years may be financing. Solar energy financing comes from multiple sources (federal, utility rate payers and private capital). Difficulties in any of the sectors will constrain the total financing. In particular, without new approaches to utility contributions, in the current near-recessionary (recessionary) environment, there will be limits to how much of a cost burden can be placed on the rate-payer. PV and HCPV technologies should and will dominate development in the next ten years, especially in a DG format. With all the talk of large-scale projects and exporting to the rest of the country, it would make sense to take care of the domestic needs of potential power exporters first and then use the fixed cost clean power to build generation for export. The Grand Solar Plan suggests equal development on a GW basis for each technology for the next ten years. On that basis alone, with , MW of solar thermal in process, the focus for the next five to years should be on PV deployment, especially in the DG development model (PV because it is scalable, modular and flexible can be developed in a central station format or distributed format). Another way to think about it is to emphasize the technology that offers the ``two-fers'' or perhaps more elegantly ``positive externalities.'' These are other positive benefits that come from the technologies, independent of clean, cost-effective energy generation. Economic development and job creation is essentially the same for each technology, more maintenance jobs for solar thermal, more flexible job experience for PV. Solar thermal is not less expensive than PV, and there is evidence that it is more expensive when comparing scale to scale. Other features and comparisons will be discussed later. PV is scalable and flexible and it can be developed across a whole range of sizes from a few kilowatts to +MW on rooftops and ground mounted, using land that may not have any other productive use. Developed near to the customer demand, transmission costs can be saved. Larger numbers but smaller installations spread across more communities could be deployed, permitting more people and more communities to participate in the economic benefits of a large infrastructure development campaign. Large scale DG deployment also offers additional reliability as has been noted above. Scale development of any solar technology has the potential to bring cost down, from component manufacturing to installation practices to financing and other transaction costs. Utility scale solar thermal provides component scale benefit solely to utility scale solar thermal. Because the same components are used in PV small scale to utility scale, any wins in the PV area have benefits across the whole range from utility scale down to the small systems on homes or for remote emergency applications. For the next three to five years it is critical that we allocate solar energy investment to the highest benefit lowest risk installations. That would suggest a predominant role for DG, where the rate-payer investment can be more effectively stretched with private capital, and where the investment has the biggest return to rate- payers: near the load, dispersed throughout communities, benefiting more communities. Larger investments, with longer construction periods, greater cost of construction exposure, higher technology and performance risks, are less beneficial under the current constrained conditions. Since PV can go to scale in a DG format ( to MWs) and at the higher MW level, deliver price breaks equal to or below the current cost of large scale solar power, it is prudent to focus on PV technology and DG scale. As presented in the technology obstacles above, DG presents difficulties for utilities concerning revenue loss. With the entry into the market place of means to address those concerns, large volume strategically developed and integrated DG projects utilizing PV technologies will dominate in the next years. In the second five, CPV and HCPV advances in scalability will support additional DG and more cost effective central station from regions like Arizona that have good solar resource and available land. . Current regulatory environment and incentive structure & large- scale solar development. Key to large scale development in the near-term is the extension of the Federal Investment Tax Credit, standard interconnection and net metering at the federal level, support for solar energy on federal lands and protection for the key solar energy financing mechanism to date, the Power Purchase Agreement (``PPA''). The rationale for the first two issues have been offered and discussed above. Support for solar energy development on federal lands could be in terms of multipliers for requirements for federal agencies to deploy solar energy on-site and other federal lands as was done in EPACT (energy production is doubled for accounting purposes), and in reducing the administrative burden for long-term leases, etc. The fourth issue, protection for the PPA, like standard interconnection and net metering has been addressed in many states, but not all. This requirement concerns the ability of PPAs to be offered by solar energy developers without the burden of excessive and unnecessary regulatory requirements and approval. Federally preempting state attempts to prohibit or restrict on-site generation could consist of the following: ``Provision of electricity from equipment which uses solar energy to generate electricity shall not be considered a sale of electricity for the purposes of any federal, State, or local regulation governing sales of electricity or regulating utility service, provided the sale is to serve load on the premises where the system is located, or on contiguous property.'' . Distributed photovoltaics, concentrating photovoltaics, solar thermal technology comparisons, R&D funding & Congressional actions. Solar energy consists of two kinds of approaches: capturing the sun's photons (solar electric, photovoltaics, ``PV'') and capturing the sun's heat (solar thermal). These approaches can be developed in two formats: central station and distributed generation (``DG''). Central Station consists of large scale ( MW to GW, multiple square miles), remotely located, and connected to the grid via transmission lines and infrastructure for distances up to hundreds of miles. Distributed generation (``DG'') consists of micro generators of hundreds of watts up to MW and can be located near the consumer demand. DG does not require transmission infrastructure, and is delivered to the end-user directly through the service panel or in larger systems of multiple megawatts by means of distribution lines and equipment. Capturing the sun's heat requires components and equipment that is different depending on whether the developed in central station or DG format. Capturing the sun's photons, depends on similar components regardless of small scale or large-scale development. (This is particularly true for PV. For concentrating and high concentrating PV, smaller scale may not be effective). Utility scale solar thermal approaches include parabolic troughs, power towers, and other systems. Most systems concentrate the sun's heat and focus that heat on production of steam to turn electric generators that then produce electricity. PV, concentrating PV (``CPV'' to equivalent suns) and high concentrating PV (``HCPV'' in excess of suns) all use semi- conductor material that when exposed to the photons of the sun, directly produce electric current. The concentrating technologies, by means of special lens, dishes and reflective surfaces, effectively multiply the potential electric current from the photon energy of the sun (some proposed CPV systems are hybrids and use heat for energy production, but they are exceptions). Such systems require tracking and sophisticated thermal management. The complexity is offset by the potential to substantially increase the percent efficiency of PV to to percent. As sophisticated tracking and thermal management technologies from other industries, especially the defense industry, migrate to the CPV and HCPV arena, these complexities could be profitably managed. As experience increases the certainty regarding performance, CPV and HCPV can become more viable, especially those that lend themselves to a scalable, modular and flexible development profile. (Please see pictures of systems following the text). A key consideration for assessing the functionality and finance- ability of a technology, is how quickly and efficiently it can be deployed. Finance-ability requires long-term dependable production, either low cost or reasonably predictable operation and maintenance costs, and other minimized risk factors. The following table summarizes risk factors for PV and solar thermal. Due to the limited deployment of CPV and HCPV technologies, the risk analysis was not meaningful. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] There is a feature of solar thermal that may make it more advantageous and that is storage. Adequate storage increases the dispatch-ability and value of solar energy generation. Large-scale storage for solar thermal, supported by fossil fuel generation, is purported to be farther along in the development and reliability cycle than large-scale storage options for PV. Several proposed projects with storage features are expected to be completed in the next three years and will clarify. Development Format: Central Station and Distributed Generation PV (and CPV and HCPV) can be developed in a DG or central station format, though nearly all developments to date have been in a DG format. Utility scale solar thermal requires a central station format. As has been discussed, there are many advantages to DG, as summarized below: [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Other Regulatory & Incentive Mechanisms Pricing Carbon Emissions Currently, pricing carbon emissions has been done indirectly, through an assumed green value attributed to generation from renewable sources. How these attributes are valued and bought and sold is dependent upon the regulatory framework adopted by the state where the project is located. Establishing market based pricing mechanisms at the national level, by means of carbon taxes and/or carbon trading would be very productive and supportive of rapid and efficient deployment of solar energy. Among other positive results would be a reduction in transaction costs. Setting Standards & Mandates Although market driven strategies are always to be preferred on core resource issues, standards and mandates are often prudent and necessary to achieve certain objectives. The electric power industry is a regulated monopoly and does not operate in an environment where competitive alternatives can be easily presented and adopted. This is especially true in a market where many of the negative costs have not been systematically included, as is true for electric power. A national requirement or standard for renewable energy deployment could be helpful. Summary of Federal Research & Development Support and Regulations Research & Development .

Our choices must reflect a hard-nosed look at the risk, no matter how brutal the facts are.

LOCKWOOD, MANAGER, RENEWABLE ENERGY, ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY Ms. Lockwood. Madam Chairman, Members of the Committee, and staff, thank you for the opportunity to provide APS' perspective on utility-scale solar power. Arizona is the second fastest growing state in the country, growing at three times the national average. APS serves more than a million customers, who at their peak consume more than , megawatts of electricity, and electricity demand is growing at a rate of hundreds of megawatts each and every year. As has been discussed all afternoon this afternoon, in Arizona our most abundant resource is sunshine, and APS is looking for ways to put the sun to work providing electricity. APS is committed to making Arizona the solar capitol of the world. The focus of my comments today is on CSP or Concentrating Solar Power technology, which we have also heard a lot about from the previous witnesses today. As Congressman Mitchell mentioned, APS recently announced the Solana Generating Station. Solana is a megawatt solar power plant, to be located just outside of Phoenix, Arizona. APS has signed a long-term contract with Abengoa Solar, the project developer and owner, for all of the electricity generated by Solana. If operating today, Solana would be the largest power plant, solar power plant, in the world. The plant will use nearly three square miles of parabolic trough mirrors and receiver pipes, and operating at full capacity the plant will produce enough electricity to power , homes. Also mentioned frequently today, including Congressman Hall and Chairman Gordon, is the importance of energy storage when it comes to solar, and that is one of the most important aspects of the Solana Generating Station, is its ability to capture and store energy for later use. By using large insulated tanks filled with molten salt, heat captured during the day can be stored and used to produce electricity when the sun is no longer shining. This value cannot be underestimated. Because it can provide energy even after the sun has set, this technology provides maximum value and reliability for APS and its customers. Solana also provides significant economic benefits for the State of Arizona. The Solana Generating Station will provide , construction jobs, and permanent operations jobs. The total economic impact is much greater. All totaled, Solana will result in over a billion dollars in economic development for Arizona. And, Solana is not the end of APS' interest in CSP, as Kate mentioned earlier we believe this is a viable commercial technology that can provide significant energy for our customers in coming years. Depending on many factors, APS alone could envision over , megawatts of CSP in our system in the next to years. Today, the single biggest obstacle in the success of Solana is the potential expiration of the percent investment tax credit. I am sure that is something you have heard many times before, and will probably hear many times again. Without this tax credit, Solana is simply not affordable today. I also need to be clear that a one- or two-year extension of the ITC will not be sufficient. While it may be acceptable for small-scale solar projects, and for wind projects, large- scale solar is different. The approval, permitting and construction of the Solana Generating Station will take three to four years to complete. We cannot begin until we know it will be eligible ITC once it is complete. As Congressman Mitchell mentioned, if a long-term extension of the ITC is not granted, Solana will not be completed. If the ITC is extended for a sufficient period, there will be many other plants like Solana built in the next five to years. If not, the industry will lose its momentum and no large-scale solar plants will be constructed. The future of large-scale solar depends on getting those first few plants in operation. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and Members of the Committee, for the opportunity to share this information with you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Lockwood follows:] Prepared Statement of Barbara D. Lockwood Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide Arizona Public Service Company's (APS') perspective on utility-scale solar power. My comments will focus on the opportunity solar provides for clean, reliable electricity, and the challenges associated with realizing that potential. APS is the largest and longest serving electric power utility in Arizona. Arizona is the second fastest growing state in the country, and APS has more than a million customers who, at their peak energy consumption, use more than , megawatts of electricity. By , APS will have nearly two million customers demanding over , megawatts of electricity. To meet this rapid growth in electricity demand, APS is investing $ billion a year in infrastructure. That number does not include additional generation sources. For APS alone, our peak demand is growing at hundreds of megawatts per year, or the equivalent of one medium-sized natural gas plant each and every year. Meeting the growing needs of our customers is both a challenge and an opportunity. In Arizona, our most abundant renewable resource is sunshine. The solar resource in Arizona is virtually unlimited, with more than days of sunshine each year. In addition, Arizona has sizable quantities of wide-open, flat landscape that is ideal for the installation of large-scale solar equipment. Among the most important factors in considering a resource for electricity production is the reliability of the fuel. Arizona's solar climate provides a resource that is both dependable and predictable. APS is committed to making Arizona the solar capital of the world and bringing affordable renewable energy to all its customers. A balanced renewable energy portfolio including solar, wind, geothermal and biomass/biogas resources is fundamental to our operating strategy. For the past two decades, APS has worked with the solar industry and researchers around the U.S. and the world to bring lower cost and reliable solar electricity to our customers. In , the APS Solar Technology And Research (STAR) center was developed to support the advancement of solar resources, including field operation of both photovoltaic and concentrating solar technologies. In addition to STAR, APS currently has over five megawatts of photovoltaic power plants in operation providing reliable solar energy to our customers. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] APS has also supported the advancement of concentrating solar power (CSP). These technologies are ``thermal electric systems'' that use solar heat to drive generators and engines. CSP thermal systems include solar trough concentrator systems and central receiver (power tower) systems that use many mirrors to focus light on a central solar collector. CSP also include solar dish Stirling systems and other advanced solar concepts. In fact, APS constructed the first commercial CSP plant in the United States in almost years. The Saguaro Solar Power Plant, which came on-line in , is a one megawatt parabolic trough facility located just north of Tucson at Red Rock, Arizona. This plant has provided critical learning for APS, the CSP industry, and researchers. While small in size, it has facilitated new interest in CSP around the country and the world. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] But that was just the beginning of our entrance into commercial CSP. Also in , APS stepped forward to lead a coalition of southwestern utilities interested in CSP. The Joint Development Group is a consortium of seven entities exploring the possibility of a megawatt CSP project to be located in Arizona or Nevada. Acting as project coordinator, APS issued a request for proposals in December of . If all goes well, the consortium project could be selected this summer. But our most significant step to date is the announcement on February , , of the Solana Generating Station. Solana is a megawatt solar power plant to be located miles southwest of Phoenix near Gila Bend, Arizona. APS has signed a long-term contract with Abengoa Solar, project developer and owner, for percent of the electricity generated by Solana. Solana is the Spanish word for ``sunny place.'' If operating today, Solana would be the largest solar power plant in the world. The plant will use nearly three square miles of parabolic trough mirrors and receiver pipes, coupled with two -megawatt steam generators. Operating at full capacity, the plant will produce enough electricity to power , Arizona homes. Solana also provides significant economic benefits to the State of Arizona. The Solana Generating Station will provide , construction jobs between and and permanent operations jobs. Solana will also generate between $ million and $ million in tax revenue over the year life of the plant. All total, Solana will result in over $ billion in economic development for the Arizona economy. Finally, Solana is an emission-free source of electricity, avoiding nearly , tons of carbon dioxide, , tons of nitrogen oxides, and tons of sulfur dioxide each year. It is the equivalent of removing , cars from the road each year. Solana will also use percent less water than the current agricultural usage of the land. APS selected Abengoa Solar as its partner for Solana because of its track record as a solar developer, its critical operational experience and a reputation for meeting contractual obligations. One of the most important aspects of Solana is its ability to capture and store solar energy for later use. By incorporating large insulated tanks filled with molten salt, heat captured during the day can be stored and used to produce electricity when the sun is no longer shining. The molten salt and heavily insulated tanks are able to retain heat with very high efficiency, and the stored heat can then be extracted in the evening or even the following day to create electricity. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] The stored heat not only increases the total amount of electricity generated, it also adds specific operating benefits for APS. The ability to use stored heat on demand, also referred to as ``dispatching,'' allows APS to respond to customer usage patterns and emergency energy needs more effectively. Most southwest utilities experience their highest customer demand during the summer months. While the power need is substantial in the middle of the day, peak energy demand occurs in the late afternoon and into the early evening hours. Because it can provide energy even after the sun has set, the solar trough with thermal energy storage provides the maximum value for APS and its customers. Diversification of generation resources is critical to maintaining a reliable electric system and concentrating solar power provides a significant opportunity to diversify energy resources. In addition, the costs to construct and maintain concentrating solar power plants have declined while at the same time equipment and labor costs, rising fuel prices and emissions concerns are increasing the risks of conventional resources. APS also recognizes that renewable energy strategies will become even more important under the prospects of carbon legislation. With zero carbon emissions, energy from solar power provides one method of addressing concerns around global warming while continuing to provide reliable electricity to our customers. And Solana is not the end of our interest in CSP. APS is currently engaged in a formal dialogue with our regulators, stakeholders and customers about our future energy sources. We are exploring the availability, cost, regulatory and policy implications associated with many different types of resources including nuclear, natural gas, coal, energy efficiency and renewable energy. One of several scenarios under discussion is one where CSP plays a central role, adding , megawatts by . Each of these efforts will help us to meet, and possibly exceed, the progressive Renewable Energy Standard established by the Arizona Corporation Commission. CSP, in particular the solar trough, is proven, reliable technology. There are no technical barriers to deployment of this technology today, and APS is aggressively exploring the near-term potential. In considering the long-term potential for utility scale solar, one topic of consideration is how to integrate large solar plants into the regional and national electric grid. This topic raises numerous issues including availability of land for large scale installation and the availability of transmission facilities and transmission capacity to deliver the energy to load centers. The lack of transmission capacity and how that is managed will be a significant factor in the long-term success of utility-scale solar. In fact, transmission is generally constrained in much of the west and significant new transmission investment is needed in the coming years for all types of generation be they renewable or conventional generation. New transmission is being planned throughout the west and in California, New Mexico, Nevada, and Texas specifically to access renewable resources including wind and geothermal. Others states and utilities, including APS, are studying their needs for both intra- and interstate transmission to ensure a robust grid to meet the needs of the West's burgeoning population. The studies include the ability to reach those areas of the west with abundant cost-effective renewable resources. Also, the possibility of locating large scale solar on federal land should be investigated and analyzed. By its nature, solar technologies require significant geographic footprints. A general rule of thumb for a solar installation is five to acres per megawatt. As I previously stated, the Solana Generating Station requires three square miles of contiguous land. Considering that the Federal Government is the largest land owner in the U.S., a study of federal land in high solar resource areas that may be made available for CSP development would also be beneficial and appropriate. However, the biggest obstacle to the success of utility-scale solar, including Solana, is the potential expiration of the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Solana, and projects like Solana, became possible when the federal ITC for solar systems was increased from percent to percent in . While large-scale solar is still more expensive than conventional resources, the percent investment tax credit decreased the cost sufficient to make these projects a reasonable option. Without these tax credits, large scale solar projects, including Solana, are simply not affordable today. As you know, the percent ITC is scheduled to expire at the end of . The approval, permitting and construction of the Solana Generating Station will take three to four years to complete. The Solana project also requires well over a billion in capital investment. APS, Abengoa Solar, and the financial institutions providing funding for Solana require certainty that Solana will be eligible for the ITC once operational. If a long-term extension of the ITC is not granted, Solana will not be completed. A different federal tax credit, the production tax credit (PTC), has spurred significant development for other renewable energy resources, most notably wind energy. The PTC has been extended five times since its introduction in and each extension was for one to two years. Although the wind industry has worked toward longer-term extensions, wind energy projects, and smaller scale solar projects, have much shorter time frames for construction, which makes short-term extensions of the PTC acceptable, if not preferable. Although the solar ITC is typically packaged with the PTC in discussions of extensions, large-scale solar has very different needs related to tax credits. A one- or two-year extension of the solar ITC is simply not sufficient to make large scale solar projects like Solana a reality. In fact, a one or two year extension of the Solar ITC may effectively cancel the project. Large scale solar has little hope of realizing its potential without a long-term extension of the ITC. APS believes an eight-year extension is optimal. Eight years should be sufficient to get a number of large scale solar facilities completed. It is also long enough to establish the supporting industries like mirror and receiver manufacturing in the United States. Once the industry gains a foothold, prices will decline and incentives will no longer be necessary. Another critical aspect of the ITC is the fact that it is not available to public utilities. The restriction needlessly narrows application of the credit and is unfair to U.S. citizens because the vast majority purchase power from a public utility, as it is defined by the tax code. This current policy forces a third-party owner to take advantage of the ITC and it creates unnecessary uncertainty and costs to the system. It requires the utility and regional grid to consider the operational and financial risks inherent in any third party relationship thus potentially affecting the utility operating strategies. APS is managing these risks with Solana, but it creates a sub-optimum situation when it is the only strategy available. I was also requested to address a recently published article. ``A Solar Grand Plan,'' published in the Scientific American Magazine in December , describes a world where solar energy provides percent of the U.S.'s electricity by . It includes huge tracts of land covered in solar and a new direct-current transmission system across the U.S. It also includes -hour thermal storage for CSP and compressed-air energy storage for photovoltaics, which allow the production of energy from solar resources around the clock. ``A Solar Grand Plan'' is certainly grand. It's a big, bold vision for a new energy era. Without analyzing the details of the plan, there appear to be no glaring technical issues with the proposed strategies. CSP and photovoltaics are proven technologies. As described, thermal storage and compressed-air energy storage are likely viable concepts. Finally, direct current transmission is already in operation today. No, the challenges with this plan are not technical. But there are enormous planning, regulatory, and policy challenges with achieving this vision. Most importantly, energy policy decisions are made largely at the individual utility and State level. Each utility and state has different perspectives, and different regulatory authorities, that control the vast majority of decisions around generation sources and transmission. And although I haven't analyzed the cost presented in the article, the execution of such a plan would clearly depend on gaining great cost efficiencies. Clearly, the potential for utility scale solar electricity is enormous. If, and only if, the ITC is given a long-term extension, I predict we will see several thousand megawatts of utility scale solar developed in the next five to years. At least seven major projects have been announced since . If the ITC is not extended for a sufficiently long period of time, the industry will lose its precious momentum and no large scale solar plants are likely to be constructed. The future of large scale solar depends heavily extending the ITC and getting those first few plants in operation. These initial plants are planned to supplement existing fossil fuel resources and help to satisfy our growing energy needs. In the long- term, utility scale solar could be a viable option in replacing base load fossil fuel facilities as those assets are retired. But costs need to decline significantly to make that a viable option. Only then will solar be a viable option for replacing base load assets that are being retired. Assuming success in the near-term, the prospect for the next to years is virtually unlimited. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee for the opportunity to share these observations and opinions with you. Biography for Barbara D. Lockwood Barbara D.

JOSEPH KASTNER, VICE PRESIDENT OF IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATIONS, MMA RENEWABLE VENTURES LLC Mr. Kastner. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and the Subcommittee Members, for providing this opportunity. As many of your questions addressed the Nellis Air Force Base project I would like to begin by recognizing Lieutenant Colonel Karen White, who is in the audience today. Lieutenant Colonel White was instrumental in making the Nellis Air Force Base project a success, and it is great to have her here. Ms. Giffords. Welcome, Colonel, thank you for being here today. We appreciate it. Mr. Kastner. On behalf of MMA Renewable Ventures and the solar industry, I am happy to provide the following comments related to the development and financing of utility-scale solar. In , MMA completed the project development and third party financing of over megawatts of solar, including the megawatt facility at Nellis Air Force Base, the largest PV installation in North America. We are actually pursuing domestic opportunities in other renewables and our parent company MMA has built this business largely around sustainable and socially-responsible investment opportunities, including affordable housing, renewable energy, and sustainable land investments. Ms. Giffords. Mr. Kastner, I don't mean to interrupt, but can you move the microphone a little bit closer? Mr. Kastner. Sure. Ms. Giffords. Okay. Mr. Kastner. The Nellis project involves a public/private partnership that is advantageous because the affiliated public entities could not avail themselves of the Federal tax benefits. The project was enabled by the following commercial arrangements: . LA -year site lease with the United States Air Force; . LA power purchase agreement with Nellis Air Force Base; . LAn agreement to sell Nevada Power the renewable energy credits associated with the project for years; . LAn installation contract with Sun Power Corporation; . LAnd finally, financial arrangements that included construction financing from Merrill Lynch, permanent debt financing from John Hancock, and tax equity financing from Citicorp, Allstate and MMA Financial. The combination of these complex legal and financial arrangements enabled the project. We believe that this type of public/private partnership provides a commercial approach that can be used at a variety of sites of varying size and scale in the U.S. All fuel-less electric generation technologies are more capital intensive than conventional combustion-based technologies. And thus, they require long-term stability and certainty in financial, legal and regulatory environments, in order to mobilize the long-term investment. The following concepts are key to providing stability and certainty for solar projects. As has already been mentioned, first and foremost, a long- term extension is needed for the current percent investment tax credit. The ITC is critical to the development and financing of utility-scale solar projects and DG projects, and necessary to ensure continuing domestic project development. History has shown that the short-term tax credit, subject to the uncertainty of congressional reauthorization, can actually be detrimental to the development of renewable energy. Uncertainty around the extensions of the production tax credit for wind power increases the cost of capital for projects and causes the inflation of equipment costs due to supply constraints. We would expect the same fate for solar without the long-term extension of the tax incentive. Stability and certainty are also critical for the commercial arrangements which enable the projects. In the case of the Nellis installation, a change in law risk within the standard REC contract had the potential to make the project somewhat less than financeable. If the Public Utility Commission of Nevada had not issued an order that provided assurances regarding this change in law risk the project may not have been financed. In most states where solar PV projects are being implemented, they are enabled, at least in part, by State renewable portfolio standards. This is certainly true for the Nellis project. The geographic reach and timing of such programs would be enhanced through a Federal initiative. The National RPS would provide certainty by guaranteeing a minimum degree of market demand for renewable energy. Such an initiative must provide ample flexibility for State programs that surpass federal minimum standards and encourage the dissemination of best regulatory and utility procurement practices, including standardized contracts that provide sufficient long-term certainty for mobilizing capital markets. Such an initiative should also support diversification through the development of promising technologies in appropriate regions. A specific solar requirement from the Nevada RPS helped to enable the Nellis project, and is why it occurred in Nevada, and not in Arizona or New Mexico. Lastly, a federal cap and trade system, or emission tax, would help to internalize the environmental and social costs of emissions caused by burning fossil fuels. This would also help to create a level playing field for all generation types. In conclusion, investors are beginning to respond to the market-driving incentives for solar energy provided by Federal and State government. The Nellis project is a great example of how these types of incentives can be combined to create a viable project opportunity. These types of opportunities will only reach the volumes required to significantly reduce the costs of solar energy if the incentive programs are structured to ensure the creation of a stable, long-term market for investment. The market for these opportunities could be expanded greatly through various actions at the federal level, including a national RPS and the adoption of a market mechanism or tax for internalizing external costs of emissions from conventional energy sources. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kastner follows:] Prepared Statement of Joseph Kastner Good Morning. On behalf of my company, MMA Renewable Ventures, LLC and the solar industry, I am happy to provide the following comments related to the development and financing of utility scale solar projects. In , MMA Renewable Ventures completed the project development and financing of more solar photovoltaic projects in the United States than any other company in the U.S. as measured by total capacity installed (more than MWp) from over discrete projects. We are especially proud of the development and financing of the MWp solar photovoltaic (PV) project on Nellis Air Force Base--the largest such project ever built in North America and one of the largest in the world. In a significant portion of these projects, the land owner and power purchaser has been a public entity such as a Federal Government department, municipality, or transit district. As you know, such entities cannot avail themselves of the federal investment tax credits (ITCs) and accelerated depreciation benefits offered under the Internal Revenue Code. In all of these transactions, MMA Renewable Ventures served as the third party project developer and financing party which develops the projects, negotiates the power purchase agreements, secures the necessary land rights, negotiates engineering, procurement, and construction contracts, negotiates interconnection agreements with distribution utilities, and obtains construction and permanent financing (debt and tax equity). Consequently, we are intimately knowledgeable and experienced with every aspect of project development and finance of solar PV projects. In addition to solar PV projects, MMA Renewable Ventures is actively pursuing and developing wind, biomass, biofuel, and energy efficiency opportunities in the U.S. market. We expect to add energy efficiency projects to our portfolio of operational assets in and wind, biomass, and biofuel projects within the next two calendar years. Similar to solar, many of these opportunities are dependent upon an extension of currently existing tax credit provisions, in this case the production tax credit (PTC) in Section of the tax code. MuniMae, the parent company of MMA Renewable Ventures, has built a business largely around sustainable and socially responsible investment opportunities. Historically, this has involved affordable housing and more recently renewable energy and sustainable land investments. Description of the Solar Project at Nellis AFB The development and financing of the solar project at Nellis Air Force Base (AFB) was based on the following commercial arrangements: . Nellis AFB has leased acres of property to a special purpose entity called Solar Star NAFB, LLC, owned and operated by MMA Renewable Ventures, for a period of twenty years beginning January following the start of commercial operation for the project; . Solar Star NAFB has in turn agreed to sell the power output of the plant to Nellis AFB for a coincident term; . Solar Star NAFB has also agreed to sell the renewable energy credits (RECs)--the tradable credits representing the environmental attributes, benefits and other values of renewable energy--to Nevada Power for the same -year term. Nevada Power purchases such credits in order to comply with the Renewable Portfolio Standard required under Nevada's Renewable Energy Law; . On behalf of Solar Star NAFB, MMA Renewable Ventures negotiated an engineering, procurement, and construction contract (EPC Contract) with PowerLight Corporation, which is now SunPower Corporation, Systems (SunPower). Under the EPC Contract, SunPower purchased more than , solar modules and inverters, constructed the tracking systems, assembled racks of modules, transported equipment, arranged labor on the site, and interconnected all the system components; . On behalf of Solar Star NAFB, MMA Renewable Ventures arranged for construction financing from Merrill Lynch, debt financing from John Hancock Insurance Company, and equity financing from CitiCorp North America, Allstate Insurance Company, and MMA Financial. The sum total of these complex legal and financial arrangements enabled the construction of the largest PV plant in North America. While the specifics of each party and arrangement may vary from project to project, we believe that this public-private partnership model provides a commercial approach that can be used at a variety of sites of varying size and scale. Recommendations for Promoting Utility-Scale Solar Projects Utility-scale solar projects represent the greatest opportunity for solar electric generation technologies to reach cost parity with conventional gas and coal-fueled electric generation. When equipment, labor, and capital are deployed to build solar projects at a scale counted in tens of megawatts, gains from economies of scale including the spread of transaction costs can deliver lower cost solar power. Additionally, this will spur the cost efficiencies required to make the deployment of distributed generation more competitive with retail electricity rates requiring minimal subsidies. In order to promote the development of projects of such scale, project developers and financial entities need to have a relatively stable financial, legal, and regulatory environment. All fuel-less electric generation technologies are more capital intensive than conventional combustion-based technologies, requiring long-term stability in the business environment to mobilize capital. The following concepts/initiatives are key to the development and financing of utility-scale solar: . Long-Term Federal Tax Incentives The current percent investment tax credit (ITC) for solar projects expires at the end of . At present, these federal incentives are critical to the development and financing of utility- scale solar projects. Without the federal tax benefits, utility-scale solar projects will not be viable because the cost of energy will simply be too high. The effectiveness of existing incentives is significantly limited in driving development of utility scale projects with long lead time particularly given the pace of development and consumer adoption of energy technologies. The existing tax credits or incentives are short- term, piecemeal programs subject to the uncertainty of the Congressional reauthorization and/or appropriations processes. For example, the production tax credit for wind and other types of renewable energy, established in , has been subject to three expirations and several short-term extensions (some retroactive). Uncertainty around the ITC extension increases the cost of capital due to the risk of meeting a deadline and leads to a boom and bust cycle which has caused the inflation of equipment costs purely from supply constraints. Congress should pass a long-term ITC to drive substantial private sector investment in clean energy technologies. Investors need stable, long-term, and predictable incentives. MMA Renewable Ventures supports a minimum seven-year timeframe for clean energy tax credits because this is the minimum period necessary to enable rational investment decisions and deployment of resources in utility scale projects. The federal regulatory environment's support for energy technologies can be significantly improved by establishing consistency and predictability. At the bottom line, those of us who are actually building and financing utility-scale solar projects need greater certainty of the federal tax benefits. In addition, the ITC could benefit from the amendment of several rules within the IRS code: Eliminate the basis adjustment so that one-half of ITC is not ``recaptured''; Make renewable energy investments eligible for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) consideration. Structured correctly, this could serve to catalyze both distributed and utility-scale solar projects in low and moderate-income communities and/or serving public facilities. It would also serve to attract additional institutional investors into the space and help to create ``green-collar'' jobs in lower-income communities; Create an ``economic substance'' carve-out for solar tax credits similar to what was done for low-income housing tax credits; Raise the production tax credit (PTC) for solar to make it competitive with the ITC and give investors a choice of either one. The PTC structure is a better fit for some investors and will encourage more capital to enter the solar space; Match the residual value exemption currently available to the low income housing sector, allowing for no constraints at resale after the tax benefits have been monetized; Abolish the possibility for ITC recapture in the event of a catastrophic loss without replacement by the end of a calendar year; Allow tax equity to enter project after the system as reached commercial operation under any financing structure. . A Stable Legal Framework One of the important prerequisites for investors in utility-scale solar projects is certainty the commercial arrangements will remain intact for the full term of the financing. Utility purchasers, commissions, and State and federal regulations all need to provide certainty and assurances that the various commercial arrangements will not materially change throughout the life of the project. For instance, in reviewing the standard contracts proposed for the Nellis AFB project it was determined that certain elements in the site lease and the streams of revenues from the power purchase arrangement with Nellis AFB and the REC Agreement with Nevada Power made the project somewhat less than financeable. The most significant instance involved the change-in-law risk associated with the REC agreement. If the Public Utility Commission of Nevada had not issued an order that approved the contract and an associated stipulation that provided assurances regarding change-in-law risk, the project might not have been financed. . A National Renewable Portfolio Standard Today, renewable energy resources provide a fraction of total U.S. energy, with the potential for significant growth. More than twenty- seven states and the District of Columbia utilize a wide variety of renewable portfolio standard (RPS) mechanisms to drive a greater reliance on renewable energy. A basic RPS requires the electric utilities (investor-owned utilities and publicly-owned utilities) within a state to procure a percentage of their electricity output necessary to meet load from renewable energy sources in a specified timeframe. Current State policies require varying percentages of renewables, typically targeting a goal of one percent to five percent in the first year, increasing each year to achieve a goal of five percent to percent over approximately - years. In general, a utility can meet RPS requirements by incorporating renewable energy into its fuel mix in one of four ways: ( ) building renewable energy facilities; ( ) purchasing power directly from an existing renewable energy source; ( ) buying RECs; or ( ) by encouraging production of distributed renewable energy, efficiency, or conservation. The specifics of each RPS program vary widely state to state from the goal, to the criteria, to the method of implementation. Many State programs set standards for specific technologies to ensure diversity of electricity supply by supporting the development of promising technologies that may not currently be the most economic. A national RPS would set the minimum standard for wholesale renewable energy usage throughout the United States. This would serve the important function of guaranteeing a minimum degree of market demand for renewable energy generation. Every state would be required to develop an energy regulatory strategy that includes a base level RPS with performance-based metrics that would drive investment in, and adoption of, viable, cost-effective renewable energy technologies. Specifically, Congress would mandate the establishment of minimum State renewable energy procurement standards with ample flexibility for State programs that surpass the federal minimum standards, encouraging dissemination of best regulatory and utility procurement practices, and providing states with incentives to increase reliance on renewable energy, reward energy efficiency, and to provide for a national REC market. For the reasons stated previously regarding stability, it is important that a national RPS is cognizant of existing State programs to ensure long-term investments already undertaken are not adversely affected. The federal RPS would require sufficient non-compliance measures in order to provide a strong incentive for utility compliance. A national RPS can be a market driving, demand side solution for addressing the broader goals of energy policy through development of diverse, secure renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, while at the same time encouraging technological advances throughout the energy supply chain. The future of renewable energy production in the United States resides in this synergy of governmental policy and emerging technologies--and without each, the aim of diversified, sustainable, and efficient energy production is simply impossible in the foreseeable future. By setting these aggressive goals for renewable energy production targets, the government will drive innovation and the market will create solutions. . Valuing Carbon Emissions and Other Externalities The current cost of conventional fossil-fuel electricity does not include the environmental and social costs associated with the emission of carbon, mercury, and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Either a cap-and-trade system or emission specific taxes would complement long- term subsidies and the establishment of minimum market demand by internalizing the impact of burning fossil fuels into the price of electricity. This would tend to make solar energy more competitive with fossil fuel-fired electricity and further boost investment. Market Differences in the Southwest The southwestern portion of the U.S. including California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico has the strongest solar resource in the country. The State of Nevada has an RPS-driven REC market that provides a large part of the economics for the Nellis solar project. The RPS rules for the state have specific requirements for solar and applies a multiplier to RECs (termed Portfolio Energy Credits under the Nevada RPS) produced by solar facilities. RPS programs in the other three states exist, but are not necessarily structured properly for significant market penetration of utility-scale solar projects. California California has catalyzed solar development through the California Solar Initiative (CSI) program which utilizes a short-term production based incentive. This direct subsidy has spurred the development of distributed generation projects (mostly less than one megawatt), but is not applicable for utility-scale projects. It is expected that California will introduce a tradable REC program for the existing state RPS in the near future that will encourage distributed generation projects currently suffering from subsidy levels declining faster than capital costs for key equipment. California utilities have utilized a request for offer (RFO) process fulfilling their RPS requirements. Since there is no solar set-aside, most of these contracts have been awarded to other renewable technologies that are currently more cost effective than solar. Contracts which have been awarded to solar projects under the RFO process have largely gone to earlier stage solar technologies that have yet to be implemented. The California Public Utilities Commission recently announced a feed-in tariff based on the a revised calculation methodology for the ``market price referent'' that sets the ceiling price for contracts awarded in the RFO process. The new methodology attempts to take into account the time-of-use benefits associated with the solar production curve matching well with the state-wide demand in California. The current consensus is that the announced feed-in tariff does not provide adequate levels of compensation for solar PV projects. Arizona There are certain regulatory hurdles that impede the development of solar and other clean technologies in Arizona. Low energy rates and tariff structures that do not adequately incentivize the peak-producing benefit of solar negatively impacts the economics of solar. Net- metering policies are essential to opening up the market to more wide- spread adoption, instead of limiting potential customers only to those who have day operations, and large load centers. Under the current net-metering rules only small systems are rewarded, otherwise solar generation that exceeds on-site usage is not compensated for. Like net- metering, interconnection standards must be standardized across the state and have a minimum of MW to sufficiently promote industry adoption. Lastly the available incentives are insufficient. APS has taken the lead in establishing a PBI program, which is an important step, and for the most part well-designed ( year PBI structure), however the total available funding is only enough to fund a few MW per year--which is not enough to entice the solar PV industry to undertake the cost and risk of entering a new market. New Mexico New Mexico has shown true leadership in the aggressive RPS goals and high net metering limits. This includes solar specific requirements that must be fulfilled beginning in . The law also includes a ``Reasonable Cost Threshold'' which limits the payment of power from solar installations to currently unfinanceable levels. Conclusion Investors are beginning to respond to the market driving incentives for solar energy provided by Federal and State governments. The Nellis AFB project is a great example of how these types of incentives can be combined to create a viable project opportunity when a third-party can enter and efficiently monetize the tax benefits. These types of projects will only reach the volumes required to significantly reduce the cost of solar energy if the incentive programs are structured to ensure the creation of a stable, long-term market for project developers, installers, equipment manufacturers, and investors. The geographic market for these opportunities could be expended greatly through several actions at the federal level including a national RPS and the adoption of a market mechanism for internalizing the external costs of emissions from conventional sources of energy.

Discussion Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Kastner. We appreciate the testimony from all of our witnesses, and now we are going to turn the floor over to the Members of the Committee to have a chance to ask you some questions. I know that Mr. Hall has to leave shortly after : , so I believe if I can get my questions in first, Mr. Hall, then we will move to you, and I know you have to catch your plane. In terms of the technology on the table, it is set for a briefer period than the five minutes, so what we will do is, halfway through you will see the light turn on, but when you see it getting orange and then red, if you can please either close up the questions, we'd like to be able to move rapidly through a round of questions. The Grand Solar Plan: Jobs and Economic Benefits So, I would actually like to kick off with Mr. Hansen, who talked about the Grand Solar Plan. For those individuals who have not had a chance to read the ``Scientific American'' article, we can provide that through the office here, and I will make sure that Members of the Committee have access to it as well, although I believe that most Members have had a chance to read it. It is very compelling. But, there we go, that is the front cover. There we go. I would like to dig a little bit deeper in terms of the economic benefit. You talked a lot about what it would bring in terms of the energy, and the power, and sustainability, but could you speak a little bit in terms of jobs and actual dollars? Mr. Hansen. Madam Chairman, I tried to pack about years worth of information into five minutes, so it was difficult. The Solar Grand Plan, looking from the year to , is the period when the incentives, the subsidies so to speak, to help move the technology forward, would be needed. It is our belief that after that those technologies would be compatible economically with traditional generation methodologies--coal, natural gas, et cetera. So, beyond the economics would look very similar to how the current economic situation is for development of new electrical generation. Between now and that point in time, I believe our study indicated there would be about , jobs that would be generated. And, really, we are looking for the Abengoa type of projects to be part of this Solar Grand Plan. There would be some additional drilling required, some people that would be required to additionally add that capacity for storage in the ground, but that would be, again, existing technology, it would provide more jobs for the natural gas drillers, if you will, to provide that kind of storage in the future. All of the details have not been shaken out yet, we need more time to be able to put it together. We actually do have another paper coming out. It is out for peer review at the present time, that will have more information of the details of how many jobs and where those jobs would be located. The transmission system, the energy storage systems, they will not be just in the U.S. southwest, they will be throughout the United States. So, it will bring benefits to all of the United States, not just the southwest. Nellis Air Force Base Partnership Ms. Giffords. And, going back to Mr. Kastner, and I want to just make it clear for everyone who understands, that Nellis Air Force Base launched in a public/private partnership not more than a couple of years ago, and I believe it took you about a year to complete this project. But, percent of the energy consumed on Nellis Air Force Base is now powered by solar energy, which is extraordinary when you think about a very short period of time and ability to move so quickly in that. The Mayor and I will be visiting Nellis Air Force Base in a couple of weeks, and we will be bringing members of the community along with us as well. But, can you talk a little bit about, from a policy standpoint, several of us are from the southwest, from southwestern states, you know, what did it really take in terms of leadership to be able to implement that project, tax credits, and how you can see that expanding in different states as well? Mr. Kastner. Yes. I mean, the key driving force for the economics is the renewable energy credit contract with Nevada Power, and that was really catalyzed by the renewable portfolio standard within Nevada that requires a certain amount of solar to be produced within the state. Nevada Power issued an RFP for qualifying for these contracts before the Nellis project, during the conception of the Nellis project, and that is what, you know, really brought it forward, provided an RFP by the Air Force to do the project, knowing that this contract was available. International Competition in Solar Energy Ms. Giffords. And, a general question I want to address to Ms. Maracas, and to Ms. Rauluk. I see behind you we have some representatives from the Solon AG Company, a German company that has been investing here in southern Arizona, and I want to thank you for that. I know that the United States southwest is now competing, not just with areas like Nevada, or California, or New Jersey, but we are now competing with different countries as well. Can you please touch on some of that international competition, and how we here, you know, in the United States are going to be able to be a major player , , , years from now? Ms. Maracas. Yes. I think that is a very relevant question, and it is worth adding, I think, that one of the reasons that large-scale companies like Abengoa, Bright Source, Solar Millennium and others, are now coming into the U.S. market, is because there have been over recent years a number of very favorable policies in European markets that have really spurred activity. In Spain, there is a feed-in tariff that is, essentially, a guaranteed something like Euro cents per kilowatt hour that is paid to anybody who generates megawatts, or less than megawatts, and just, essentially, develops a project that goes into the nationalized grid in Spain. So, of course, with that kind of an incentive, lots and lots of activity has been spurred in the Spanish marketplace. Other countries in Europe have similar measures, and the markets are growing rapidly in those countries. Well, that has enabled companies to, like I just mentioned, to develop economies of scale, achieve technology advancements, and make the technology more affordable in the U.S. market. As Mark pointed out earlier, we have the best solar resource on the planet. In all of Spain, Spain's solar resource would not have even shown up on Mark's map. And so, and I am quite serious, this is about . , is that right, is kind of the high number that they strive for in Spain, compared to the . or eight kilowatt hours per square meter today that we have in this area in our home state. So, the combination of a really desirable solar resource in the southwestern states, and, particularly, our home state, that and the credible developers who are not coming into the marketplace, I think create a really good recipe for expanded growth here. Ms. Giffords. Okay, thank you. And briefly, Ms. Rauluk. Ms. Rauluk. I think it is important to remember, it is useful to have a feed in tariff or something that provides the extra value for the kilowatt hour that is produced from solar energy. That is a needed link in the marketplace. And, that is why Europe has really gone beyond what we have done in the U.S., because their value attributed to the kilowatt hours is significantly higher than it is in the United States. But, I think we have to remember that who pays that, because that dollar amount for the extra value that you are paying for has to come from the rate payers, effectively, and there is really a limit to how much you can ask the rate payers to pay. In Europe, it was a little bit easier. First of all, they have fundamentally higher electricity rates. So, if you are adding a penny to the kilowatt hour it is not a or percent increase, but it is, you know, less than that, and also the electric power industry is structured a little more simply. So, my greatest concern is, I would love to see that the incentives available in the United States would be in excess of . , . cents a kilowatt hour, you would get massive amounts of solar energy put in place. But, fundamentally, somebody has to pay, and, you know, how do we do that, and that is something we really need to think about. Thank you. Ms. Giffords. Thank you. Mr. Hall. Why Does Solar Energy Need So Much Assistance? Mr. Hall. I guess to follow up, Ms. Rauluk, why does solar need so much assistance to be a viable source of energy? Ms. Rauluk. Well, sir, there is a couple of reasons, one of which is that you are paying for all of your fuel up front, so that is the number one thing. But, fundamentally, the solar energy industry is relatively small compared to other energy industries and scale really, really is important. So, the incentive structure, the way it has always been envisioned, and this is something that we have been doing in the U.S. for the last five to eight years, the incentive structure is to bring the scale of the industry and all of the manufacturing efficiencies, et cetera, et cetera, to bear on the problem and bring the cost down. And, basically, we are realizing, though, efficiencies in both cost and performance, and this is a relatively medium-term incentive structure that we are talking about, and I would like to point out that there is not an energy system on the planet that has not been heavily incentivized because it is an important matter. We need to have reliable energy sources. So, to do this for solar is really no different than what we have done for oil and gas, and I could go on into the list. Mr. Hall. Well, I guess I was listening for you to say the reward would be great if we really could conquer this solar thrust, but you know the cost of solar energy can, if I was listening to the testimony right, can only come down and become competitive if the Federal Government, through carbon regulation, forces fossil fuels higher. Is that what I am hearing? Is that your recommendation? Ms. Rauluk. Actually, I think in some markets solar energy is competitive right now. If you have a market where peak power prices are in excess of . -. cents a kilowatt hour, which they are in some markets, there are ways that you can put the installation together where it actually is fairly cost effective. Mr. Hall. I think the rewards would really be great if and when we can conquer the problems with solar energy. It is unlimited, the reward would be unlimited. But, I see across this country a major war against fossil fuels at this time. I am from a fossil fuel state. Texas is one of ten states that produces energy for the other states. I see a thrust toward knocking out fossil fuels. If we knocked out fossil fuels, even in the next five years, these lights go out on us. We get percent of our energy from countries that don't like us. Our goal ought to be toward trying to lessen that percentage so we are not dependent on people that hate us and fly our airplanes into our buildings to kill our people. We need to really be addressing that, and solar can really help to do that, if we could find the money to put in there. But, I do not think we can find it by knocking down fossil fuels, when it is all we have now, and all we get from Saudi Arabia, percent of our energy comes from them, is solely, totally, completely fossil fuels. I think if we are going to declare war on something, we need to declare war through technology, finding cleaner fossil fuels and finding a way to do better while we seek solar. I am very fond of solar, and I think it has unlimited possibilities. Mr. Mehos, in your testimony you indicate that without the continuation of the investment tax credit new capacity is going to be delayed by about to years. How quickly do you think the capacity could be developed if the tax credits were extended? I know you cannot say it is going to be six years, days, and hours, but just give me a good estimate of it. Mr. Mehos. I think the best answer to that is to look at what Arizona Public Service and Abengoa are doing with the megawatt project. That plant probably has a construction period of, oh, let us say around two years, not knowing that specifically. But, with the investment tax credit, if that begins to roll along, what we will see are those sizes of plants being built yearly, and probably multiples of those plants. So, if I had to guess, I would say megawatts to a gigawatt per year, even in the near-term, and let us say the near-term is in that five to , once we get past this four- year threshold, then every year after that megawatts to a gigawatt or more per year. Mr. Hall. In your testimony you also indicate that without the tax credit, solar would not be very competitive with conventional energy plants for quite a while. Should the tax credit not be available, what do you envision the cost to consumers would be compared to conventional sources of energy that we have right now? Mr. Mehos. Without the investment tax credit, using concentrating solar power as a proxy for solar, and it is probably the least cost technology of those at this point, the conventional cost from our concentrating solar power plant is probably on the order of . or. cents, let us say, a kilowatt hour, without the investment tax credit. If we compare that to conventional technology in the intermediate load markets, that is about a percent capacity factor. For a combined cycle plant, you are probably looking at . or . cents per kilowatt hour. So, we are looking at, roughly, or percent higher. Environmental Effects of Using Solar Power Mr. Hall. Ms. Lockwood, I think my time is about up. In your testimony, you indicate that since the Federal Government is the largest landowner in the United States we should study the use of available land resources for CSP development. Now, what are the effects to the environment from the use of solar power? Ms. Lockwood. Congressman Hall, the effects to the environment depend on the particular location that you are in. The most obvious and clear impact is the amount of land that is consumed. We are fortunate here in the desert southwest that we have large tracts of unused land that is very well suited for solar power. We certainly have to consider homes of exotic species and other types of environmental impacts when you are looking at siting solar, but we have large tracts of land that are very well suited for this technology today. Mr. Hall. The use of all of these aides to the pursuit of solar power, you mentioned that, and I would ask you, would you support the use of closed military bases, you know, BRAC closes a lot of bases around the country, I think every years, and this is just a suggestion to you to be thinking about, because you seem to be championing that. Do you support the use of closed military bases for development of large-scale solar projects? Ms. Lockwood. Congressman Hall, I believe that is a perfectly valid opportunity for putting that land to use. Mr. Hall. I know BRAC has a provision for refineries being built where you lose a BRAC. I don't know what your State law is, what BRAC closed down for the State of New Mexico, but we lost several in Texas, and they were cut down all over the United States. Ms. Giffords. Mr. Hall, we do not allow them to close in southern Arizona either, and you realize that. Mr. Hall. Yes, I know you would not allow that. You get the pitch forks out. But, we put a provision in there. EPA is the major problem to getting permits to do things, and we had a provision in there at one time that if we made a request to EPA and they did not deny it in days it was granted. And, I know you would like that, wouldn't you? We liked that. I don't think it made it through the Senate--very little gets through the Senate nowadays. But that is a good way to get refineries. Refineries are the reason gas is going higher; there are no refineries. Companies like Exxon and others do not want to put money into it, it takes or years to get their money back. EPA would do nothing and we cannot appeal from nothing. So, we would rather have them turn us down in days, and then we can appeal it, or grant it in days and you go on with it. That is something that you might think about as you support the use of closed military bases, because I agree with you on that. I think my time is up. I wish I had more. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Hall. Vice Chairman Lipinski. Increasing the Efficiency of Solar Cells Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Chairwoman. First of all, I want to note that it is good to see, we have almost as many engineers on this panel as we have in the House of Representatives. I am one of the few engineers in the House. I also notice we have two Stanford alums here--I have an engineering degree from Stanford--and one from Berkeley unfortunately. But, I want to start out in a little different direction in terms of the technology involved right now, and where we are going with that. I co-hosted a nanotechnology showcase a couple weeks ago in Washington to see some of the new products that are coming out using nano technology. And, I know at the University of Illinois they have done some work and found that by placing silicon nano particles onto silicon solar cells they can increase the power by about percent and increase the life of the cell. Where is this work right now, in terms of improving PV cells, and how much of a difference is that going to make in the near future, near to short-term, to mid-range future, in terms of how efficient solar energy is? Whoever wants to tackle that one. Mr. Hansen. Mr. Hansen. I will try to take that one, thank you. TEP did invest in a manufacturing company, Global Solar, and I was involved in the technology looking for that, so I have some background in photovoltaics. In fact, I have a preference for photovoltaics as opposed to concentrating solar power. You know, back in , when silicon and gallium arsenide were used to develop photovoltaics, they were the predominant metals, if you will, for the use at that time. Since then, we now have those and efficiencies have improved from the less than one percent in to the to percent for silicon- based. Gallium arsenide-based are now almost at percent, and we do have some materials over percent efficiency. The--are more for silicon and sigs of copper--desalinate have all improved their efficiencies over the last decade. All the work with global solar weighs efficiency for long-scale production runs from two percent to over percent. So, all of these technologies are improving. I think we need to be careful not to focus on the efficiency when we talk about utility-scale, but to focus on cost per installed kilowatt. We have a lot of land in Arizona. I do not live in Tucson, I live in Apache County in the northeastern part of Arizona, when I travel from my home to our coal-fired power plant, and our solar plant, we have about . megawatts of solar photovoltaics there, I pass by approximately square miles of land that has about, as I like to say, eight bushes and one house on it, and there is a lot of room, it is fairly flat land. We have space in Arizona. Efficiency deals with space. Cost is going to be the driver. We need to be improving efficiency, but we need to keep our eye and our focus on reducing the costs. The nano technologies that are now being developed, and some of the organic dye technologies as well, and some of the more advanced thin films, do show promise to be able to reduce the cost of the photovoltaics to dramatically lower numbers, talking in numbers that are less than a dollar per watt, whereas, conventional technologies today are typically at the module level in the neighborhood of $ to $ a watt, some as low as $ . . This is what will drive the cost, and that is really the issue on photovoltaics, is the cost. We need to bring the cost down. Ms. Rauluk. I would like to mention a couple of things. First of all, and I am not an expert in all of the technology improvements and innovations that are in the pipeline right now, but just from my discussions and work with my colleagues at the University of Arizona and Raytheon Missile Systems, these folks have viable technologies that are, I would call it, in the final stages of R&D. So, there are some very exciting and interesting things in the PV, the concentrating PV, or CPV, and the highly-concentrated PV area that are coming out of the laboratory. Now, there are incremental changes, incremental improvements that are happening with PV, and when people look at, well, what is the efficiency and the cost, and how is this all working out, no one is thinking about, well, what is coming out of the labs, because the commercialization process is a difficult process with some uncertainties attached to it. But, let me just point out that, you know, a lot of people say, well, let us not do anything until the technology is really great, and then we will just go and one of the things that supports the technology in the labs right now is the recognition of a marketplace existing and viable. So, when these technologies are coming out of the lab, which I expect they will within the next three years, they will need to get financed by venture capital and then second-stage financing, et cetera, et cetera, and people are going to look at that and say, well, where is the market? So, even if we have a good technology, it is important that we do not wait until we get these things coming out of the labs, but that we have a systematic and reliable investment plan for the future. Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. I see a red light, and I will yield back. If we have a second round, I will have another question. Ms. Giffords. Okay, thank you. Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. Ms. Giffords. Mr. Matheson. Accelerated Technology Innovation Mr. Matheson. Well, thank you. I am not an engineer. I am, my background is in finance, but I used to be an independent power developer, and developed co-generation facilities. And, now I sit in Congress, where we try to come up with public policy ideas to help foster these new technologies. And, it seems to me that we need to be looking at this on a couple of different paths at the same time. I have heard all the witnesses talk about the need for, lack of a better term, federal subsidies to help create large-scale commercial applications of technology. What I am curious about is another path that we also ought to be talking about, I think, and that is the notion of how do we get these technologies to be more efficient so that they are commercially viable, perhaps, with less subsidies, or, perhaps, with no subsidies. And, Mr. Mehos, your last slide, at the end of your presentation, the kick-starting utility-scale solar slide, you mentioned that there is an exercise for DOE that is estimated at $ million a year to achieve the accelerated goals. And, that was what I was wondering about, is that program. It sounds to me, you can confirm this for me, but DOE has identified a path to help accelerate this technological innovation, and I think as Members of the Science Committee that is, obviously, something we have great interest in as well. So, can you share with us a little bit about what that accelerated effort entails? Mr. Mehos. Sure. The accelerated effort, as I briefly mentioned, in along two paths. It is continued technology development on the specific technologies, trying to achieve higher temperatures, and I will describe that in a second. The two technologies in the concentrating solar power program that achieve these higher temperatures are the line focused parabolic trough technologies and the more point- focused central receiver technologies, as well as the point- focused disturling technologies. But, of those first two, the parabolic trough and the central receiver technologies, going to higher temperatures achieves a couple of things. One, it allows you to operate your cycle at higher efficiencies, that does decrease the levelized cost of energy. As importantly, or maybe even more important, as you go to the higher temperatures we are dealing with high amounts of thermal storage materials having a higher delta T difference between your hot temperature and your cold temperature to work with, significantly decreases the amount of thermal storage that you are working with, and that, in itself, also decreases the cost of thermal storage, or of the levelized cost of energy. So, those are two of the higher pathways, higher temperature pathways, that lower your cost. We are working on a number of other avenues. We are looking at higher temperature materials, higher reflectivity materials, better absorbing, less emitting materials. We had a study some time ago now, I think back around with Sergeant Inlundy, basically, identified three mechanisms for reducing the cost of solar power, none of which were power peaked. The first one is the research I described. That results in about a percent reduction in the cost of electricity. The second one is just increasing the size of your plant, the type of work that APS and Abengoa are working on, going from smaller to megawatts. And, the last one is learning, it is deployment, and the more you deploy these technologies, actually, this does get into policy, then the lower the cost of the technology over time. Financing Technology Development Mr. Matheson. And, is it fair to say that, I mean, obviously, one of the variables that helps this process go is if Congress appropriates the funds so that this effort can happen. Dollars, you know, money is part of making this technology develop. Mr. Mehos. Yes. Mr. Matheson. Are there other policy options that also need to be considered or adjusted that Congress hasn't done that could help facilitate the development of these technologies? Mr. Mehos. Yes, I believe so. I think in project finance one of the key issues is risk. When we start talking about $ to $ billion projects, I mean, the risk associated with that is relatively high. The parabolic trough technology is actually fairly low risk, but still project finance can be an issue. And, as you look toward some of these higher temperature technologies, like the central receiver, or the disturling technology as an example, the policy of loan guarantees, or federal loan guarantees, comes to play there. Mr. Matheson. Okay, that is helpful. One other slide that I wanted to ask you about. You showed the difference of whether the percent ITC is extended or not, and the roll out of solar technology. It is probably impossible for you to estimate, because we do not have a policy in place yet in this country, but did you consider if the cap on trade program is put in, and there is a price associated with the carbon, how that would affect the curve when you are developing those drafts? Mr. Mehos. No, that's a good question, and we have considered it, we do not have the ability to model that yet. Mr. Matheson. Yes. Mr. Mehos. That is one of our outcomes this year, we will be able to model those types of systems. Mr. Matheson. Mr. Hansen, this is a little off target, but you mentioned smart grid when you were talking, and, you know, the Congress just passed smart grid legislation in the energy bill that passed last year. Do you feel like the legislation that Congress passed was helpful for smart grid? Are there other things we should be doing beyond what was in that legislation, or do you have any thoughts on that? Mr. Hansen. Good question. What you passed is very helpful. It is a good start. What we need now is additional, kind of what Valerie just alluded to, we need scale. That is up to the utilities. Over time, over working with our individual State regulatory entities, we will be able to get recovery for those additional costs. Mr. Matheson. Right. Mr. Hansen. I think the Federal Government has stepped up to the plate and given us the tools that we need from the federal level. I think we now need State level to step up to the plate. So, I appreciate the efforts you had last year. Thank you. Mr. Matheson. Great. Thanks. Madam Chair, I see my time is expired. Ms. Giffords. Thank you, Mr. Matheson. Mr. Mitchell. Land Usage for Solar Power Mr. Mitchell. Thank you. One of the things that was mentioned earlier was that to be successful large-scale solar facilities need land, and the Solana project is three square miles. Is there any possibility that we can be able to, with technology, lessen the need of land? You know, also mentioned was that the reason that there was a market in the southwest for solar was because we had the land, and that we had high renewable portfolio standards. One of the fights we had over this last energy bill was over the national portfolio standards, and it was knocked out mainly because there were states that said they really didn't have the land, or they didn't have the sunshine, and as a result the portfolio standards are really out here in the southwest. Is there anything we can do maybe to help establish a higher portfolio standard nationwide at the same time maybe not use as much land as we are going to be able to use here? Anybody. Mr. Hansen. If I may, again, going back to the question asked earlier about efficiency, improving the efficiency, raising the efficiency of photovoltaics, raising the temperature of the collection on concentrating solar, will reduce the amount of land that is required. Every state has the ability to produce some level of solar. There was a study done a few years back by Black and Beech on the State of Pennsylvania. I went to school in the State of Pennsylvania, I grew up in New Jersey. I don't remember seeing the sun a whole lot of the time, but, quite frankly, the result of that study indicated that the only renewable resource that could meet all of the energy needs of Pennsylvania was solar. So, every state does have the ability to put in solar. The roof tops are available, without having to use any land. There is a wide range of solar technologies available. TEP's experience is with about of those at this present time, and what we have found is that different technologies have advantages in different climatic zones, as I said in my written testimony. All of the technologies need to be developed, so that we, as a United States, have a portfolio of opportunities. We, as utilities, can pick and choose among these different technologies as to what is most appropriate for our state. I am not going to weigh in on the issue of a national renewable energy standard. I think the State of Arizona has stepped up to the plate and done an excellent job leadership- wise in developing one that is appropriate for Arizona. But, I do think that over time, with the federal level support, with the national labs, and with universities, the funding can be provided to improve the efficiency, to improve the overall storage capability, for energy in the future that is going to drive things like the solar, Grand Solar Plan and these other technologies to economic fruition, so that they will, in fact, become economically compatible with coal and natural gas. Ms. Rauluk. One of the reasons why distributed generation has value is that you don't need really large contiguous pieces of land. And, in fact, you can, Mr. Hansen already mentioned, you can put photovoltaics on roof tops, but you can also put photovoltaics in smaller pieces of land and every community has pieces of land that may be old industrial sites, next door to an old industrial site, maybe it is a buffer for an airport, whatever, that are not, you know, several square miles, but are maybe a half a square mile, or even less than that, and you can use that land for a distributed application, because it can scale down to that. So, I think that the amount of contiguous land doesn't really constrain us when we are talking about a distributed format, and there are plenty of opportunities to do that. Price of ``Green'' Power Mr. Mitchell. One last question, maybe this is Ms. Lockwood. You know, some people pay an extra little premium to encourage green production of power. Is there any way that anybody is going to take advantage of that once Solana comes on line, or is it all just going to the grid and everybody still pays the same price? Ms. Lockwood. Congressman Mitchell, we very much believe in the power of our customers to drive the policy and our resource choices. So, absolutely. Solana is several years away, but we do envision a way that our customers can choose to pay a small premium and have all or part of their energy served by Solana. Ms. Giffords. We only have a few more minutes left, and since I am going to afterwards ask our witnesses to come up, I am going to defer my questions, maybe just one additional question from each of the Members before you have to leave. Utility-Scale Versus Distributed Generation Mr. Lipinski. Yes, I will lead off here. I just want to know, we are in heaviest discussion here about utility-scale mostly, but also distributed generation. Is there any conflict or tension between the two, in terms of one obviating the need for the other? I just want to throw that out there and see some smiles on faces about this. It must be something that you deal with regularly. Mr. Hansen. If I may, they can be compatible with each other. TEP's studies have indicated that for us to produce percent of our annual energy from solar we need about , megawatts of solar installed. If every home in Tucson were to have about a three kw system, which is realistic in size, that would give us about that megawatts of solar. It is at about that point when the energy storage becomes a critical component, if we are going to move solar beyond that percent of our annual energy. That is why TEP has always been trying to develop a balance of distributed generation as well as utility-scale. Even if every home in Tucson were to install nine kilowatts of photovoltaics, that is percent of our energy. The other has to come from someplace, and we are proposing, at least I am proposing in the long-term, that that comes from the utility-scale solar, such as the megawatt system that Abengoa is planning to put in. But, it could also be from photovoltaics. In the long-term, the two systems have to mesh, and the glue that makes them mesh is the storage. Even distributed generation without utility-scale solar is going to require some level of storage to even out the day to night intermittencies. The other part of the puzzle that is hard to understand for some people who have not lived in the southwest is that most of the solar energy is actually produced in the springtime in Arizona, away from our monsoon storms. But, of course, most of the consumption is in the summertime, so we have to shift about three months worth of solar energy into the summertime. It actually works out to be approximately percent. One other factor I think that needs to be considered for the future, is plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Our calculations indicate that with an additional percent of energy per year we could provide all of the energy that is needed for all of the passenger vehicles in the City of Tucson. So, that does not include heavy trucks, and airplanes, and locomotives, but your normal passenger vehicles. That, again, could be derived from solar, and could provide an additional opportunity for storage if we go back to that smart grid development and how to integrate them as part of this storage philosophy. Mr. Lipinski. Ms. Rauluk. Ms. Rauluk. I have alluded to this in my spoken comments, and I have a more detailed explanation of it in my written comments, but there is a fundamental conflict right now in the way in which we contractually do these things between distributed generation and the utilities revenues, because the distributed generation is on the customer's site, and they are effectively purchasing less energy from the utility by generating their own energy. And then the question arises, well, how do you assure the preservation of utility revenues and the assets that they support, because this is not about getting rid of the utilities or getting rid of the fossil fuel generation by any means. So, there are things we need to do contractually and from a regulatory point of view, and the industry is well into the phase of doing that and creating the mechanisms that, basically, do not conflict, do not have the utility having a natural and inherent animosity towards distributed generation, but that it is a part of the whole system and is valuable for the whole system. Mr. Lipinski. Ms. Lockwood. Ms. Lockwood. Congressman Lipinski, I do not know that I disagree with anything Mr. Hansen or Ms. Rauluk said, but for us in Arizona, in particular, for APS, it is about growth, and we are growing so fast, our energy consumption is also growing so fast, that we need all resources to meet our energy needs into the future. We believe that both are required to get where we need to go, and do not believe there is a fundamental conflict. Now, there is some theory that there is only so much subsidy or incentive to go around, and I think that is where a lot of the debate comes in. Does it go to large scale, or does it go to distributed? And, that is a healthy debate. That is something that we need to be talking about. There are different economics when you look at those different sides of the issue. For utility scale, we very much look at it in comparison to the other resources that we have. Even without carbon today, large scale is getting--large-scale CSP, solar thermal--is pretty competitive. Our Solana plant is about a percent premium over our conventional resources, what we would have expected to pay for fossil fuel resources into the future for that project. On the distributed side, you look at it not what you pay for other large-scale generation, but you look at what the customer is paying and the offsets for that customer, and how that works within your rate structure also. So, from our perspective we need them all, and we need to make sure that we are looking at policies that facilitate them all in the appropriate way and the appropriate manner, also considering the economics and how the impact to the rate payer. Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. I thank all the witnesses for their testimony. It was extremely helpful today, and thanks to Congresswoman Giffords for bringing this together. Ms. Giffords. Thank you. Mr. Matheson. Compressed Air Storage and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mr. Matheson. Why, I'm nervous about going over the deadlines that Madam Chair set. Let me ask one real quick question. I have got to chance this. I was reading about the Grand Plan, and, you know, one of the great benefits of solar in a world where we are concerned about climate change and global warming is that we move away from fossil fuels. But, I did note that in the energy storage component of the Grand Plan, we are going to use compressed air, there would be some degree of natural gas used. Do you have a sense of what that means in terms of greenhouse gas emission? Mr. Hansen. The use of the natural gas for the reheat on the turbine, and this is, before I say that, this is a technology that can be changed. You can make turbines that do not have to have this natural gas input. Mr. Matheson. Oh, okay. Mr. Hansen. Alternatively, you could be using biomass or some other type of fuel, bio-diesel, et cetera, to do it, but it is approximately one-sixth of the input that otherwise would be required from natural gas or coal under a normal conventional technology. Mr. Matheson. Okay, thank you. That is it. Ms. Giffords. Thank you. Mr. Mitchell. I don't have a question. I would just like to thank everyone, because it was very informative, and not only the written material but your testimony. So, thank you all very much. Ms. Giffords. Well, before we bring this hearing to a close, I want to again thank our witnesses for the generous time and for really a very, very interesting discussion. The Science Committee is, I believe, the bipartisan Committee in Congress, and we have been able to do many things just in the last a little over a year, that I think this country would be very proud to know, if they had a chance to hear about it. Unfortunately, usually when we have committees the bells ring frequently, so we will have wonderful testimony, and then we will have to jump up, run over and vote and come back. So, what a luxury to actually have a chance to really focus on the information that you have presented before us today. The record is going to remain open for additional statements from the Members and answers to any follow-up questions the Committee may ask of our witnesses. I would also like to thank the bipartisan Science and Technology Committee staff for being here, for coming out from Washington to help conduct this hearing. Also, members from my staff, Tamarack Little, Wyatt King, Jacqueline Jackson, are just a couple that have worked so hard to bring this committee here to southern Arizona as well. I want to thank the solar experts, and there are many in the room today, and, hopefully, we will have a chance to hear from you in a couple of minutes, because we are going to ask our witnesses to come forward and to answer questions from the general public as well. But, to the public, thank you for caring so much about the future of the southwest, the future of our country, and the future of how we can take this tremendous potential, harness it, and turn it into some real energy. So, with that, the witnesses are excused and the hearing is adjourned. Thank you. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.] Appendix : ---------- Answers to Post-Hearing Questions Answers to Post-Hearing Questions Responses by Thomas N. Hansen, Vice President, Environmental Services, Conservation and Renewable Energy, Tucson Electric Power Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith Q . You spoke about the need for transmission and storage for solar energy. When built, do you envision this infrastructure would be available to other renewable energy technologies, such as wind, an important Nebraska resource? A . Most definitely. I envision a large number of storage facilities distributed around the country. The storage should ideally be located locally with respect to where the electric consumers are located, effectively on a regional basis, with one storage facility serving at most five million people. Locating underground energy storage locally provides the optimum solution for energy security for the residents in that area. The nationwide electrical transmission system would allow for the movement of wind energy produced in Nebraska to be stored in Nebraska or California or Maine. Just as our Interstate Highway System enables goods produced in one area to be efficiently delivered in another region, the interstate transmission system would efficiently enable solar, hydro, wind, geothermal, tidal, current and biomass energy to be moved around the Nation in a controlled manner to maximize efficiency of production and delivery. The combination of properly sized local storage with national transmission would allow management of the overall system to minimize congestion. Q . As a Member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I have a keen interest in NASA and the space program. Could solar energy collected in space be a viable source of energy for the U.S.? What are the benefits and challenges of this technology? A . This concept has been discussed for decades and is, in my opinion, technically viable although some components of the technology need to be improved in terms of reliability and efficiency. One big advantage includes better solar intensity above the atmosphere and / solar production potentially without day/night cycles or clouds to block the sun. This results in much higher specific energy production per unit area of solar collector reducing the size of the solar collector by percent or more. Building a multi square-mile solar collector in space will be challenging in terms of providing sufficient resources of material and people to a synchronous orbit. Wireless transmission of energy from space to Earth would require very accurate targeting systems and dedication of a few square miles of receivers and buffer zone on the ground to convert the beamed energy back into grid power at high efficiency. However, a large single energy receiver at the Earth end of a space solar energy collection system could be at risk from an act of terrorism, while multiple receiver zones would present more risk of component failure and resulting repair, in addition to an increase in initial cost. It also may be challenging to convince people that it is safe to live near a receiver zone. A space bound energy collector would be at greater risk of damage from collision with meteorites without protection from the atmosphere. Maintaining optimal orbital geometry to enable a space bound solar collector to keep sight of the sun at all times while also keeping its energy beam to Earth on target will be technically challenging, but not impossible. Interestingly, given that the space located solar collector would produce energy at a constant rate, energy storage would still be required to balance the constant energy input with a variable energy demand. The national transmission system would be required to allow for delivery of the space produced energy from a single, or small number of multiple, Earth side satellite energy receivers to all U.S. energy consumers. Some larger questions that still need to be answered are economic: What is the total cost of such a space located solar energy production system? What is the energy balance--will it take more energy to place the energy system in orbit and maintain it than the system will produce over its lifetime? Will more valuable jobs be created for Americans with a space bound energy collection system or a terrestrial located energy collection system? Both the space bound and terrestrial solar energy collection concepts deserve further consideration, although terrestrial solar energy collection technologies are fully developed and available commercially today. Answers to Post-Hearing Questions Responses by Valerie Rauluk, Founder and CEO, Venture Catalyst Inc. Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith Q a. You spoke about distributed generation systems, in which smaller generation systems (rooftop units and - acre land units) spread electricity generation over ``unused real estate'' and reduce risk of large scale power outages. Would the Federal Investment Tax Credit provide incentive for individuals to install smaller generation systems (e.g., rooftop units) and to become a part of a distributed generation network? If not, how could the Federal Government encourage this type of development? A a. Yes, the FTC does provide incentives for individuals interested in a distributed generation application and participating in a network. Q b. How would you envision the development of distributed generation systems? Who will pay to connect these smaller generation systems into a cohesive network? A b. In addition to extending the FTC set to expire at the end of this year, the Federal Government could further encourage such installations by setting distributed generation requirements for utilities nation- wide and to encourage incentives and research and development (especially commercialization R&D) for distributed systems and the intelligent controls and storage options that increase a DG network's value and resiliency. Q a. As a Member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I have a keen interest in NASA and the space program. Could solar energy collected in space be a viable source of energy for the U.S.? A a. Theoretically, it could be subject to resolving certain technological challenges. However, in the near-term, there are many cost-effective opportunities for harvesting solar energy on the surface of the planet. Q b. What are the benefits and challenges of this technology? A b. The chief challenge is delivering the collected solar energy to where people can use it, in electric power parlance, the ``load.'' The cost of delivering to the load from remote locations on Earth is one of the fundamental challenges and costs and is why solar energy in a distributed format is more beneficial than central station applications. Energy generation from space would create even greater costs and challenges. However, there may be some benefits to doing so. I have not reviewed the literature concerning this option and cannot offer any insights into the benefits. Answers to Post-Hearing Questions Responses by Joseph Kastner, Vice President of Implementation and Operations, MMA Renewable Ventures LLC Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith Q . As a Member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I have a keen interest in NASA and the space program. Could solar energy collected in space be a viable source of energy for the U.S.? What are the benefits and challenges of this technology? A . It is my understanding that the DOE studied the collection of solar energy with photovoltaic panels is space several decades ago. Some of the large hurdles for this idea include providing a safe, efficient means for transmitting the electricity to a terrestrial collection point (the DOE contemplated using microwaves) and the mobilization of a large-scale construction project in space (to make it worthwhile the array would be many times larger than the International Space Station). Such a large array would also be quite susceptible to space debris. Appendix : ---------- Additional Material for the Record [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] "

OVERSIGHT HEARING ON ``LOCALLY GROWN: CREATING RURAL JOBS WITH AMERICA'S PUBLIC LANDS'' ---------- Thursday, July , U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands Committee on Natural Resources Washington, D.C. ---------- The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at : a.m. in Room , Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Raul Grijalva [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Grijalva, DeFazio, Herseth Sandlin, Lujan, Bishop, Young, and Lummis. Also present: Representative Minnick. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE BEN RAY LUJAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO Mr. Lujan [presiding]. I would like to call this hearing to order. There are some old misconceptions about Federal lands in the West and the agencies which manage them. Some assert that our public lands are job killers and that the Federal land managers want to seize private land, halt industries, and harm economies. These accusations are wrong, and they undermine western communities by framing their struggles as a choice between economic development and conservation. That is a false choice, which ignores that many communities are successfully both. Given that the folks actually live in the West that we are going to be hearing from today, we will be well served to listen to them. Their approach is not to tear things down, but rather to build consensus, and even collaborate with old adversaries. And their goal is to apply the principle that the long-term health of the community and the land, and the well- being of our rural communities are all linked. We will hear today from public land managers, county commissioners, ranchers, and environmentalists, small business owners, and educators, and they will tell us about the ways that they are working together to chart a new path to prosperity using our public lands. I know that this has not been an easy road at times, especially in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But for those communities that were dependent on just one commodity for their development, this evolution is extremely critical. We look forward to hearing your stories today, but we also need to learn from them. So I also invite the witnesses to share with us the challenges and obstacles that you have faced in implementing your projects. I want to hear your frustrations, but more importantly, I want your input on how we can better support your efforts. Whether doing a round-up, battling a wildfire, or confronting a flood, rural communities are well suited to teamwork, and they always have persevered. Today, as they forge novel partnerships to create sustainable jobs, revive communities, and restore the unique western landscape, they are riding a new and promising chapter in the rich history of the American West. I want to thank all of the witnesses for traveling so far today in what I know is a busy time of year to join us, especially in this humidity. I understand that Ms. Troy, who is on our third panel, even left a Salmon River rafting trip to come testify today. Now, that is sacrifice. I look forward to hearing from you today, and I now turn to the Ranking Member for any opening comments that she may have. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CYNTHIA LUMMIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING Ms. Lummis. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too want to welcome the panelists. We are delighted that you would join us today. I find some irony, I must admit, in the fact that we just passed a bill moments ago by the full Natural Resources Committee that will actually kill jobs on Federal lands, and now we are having a hearing on how to create jobs on Federal lands. That does seem to be the tone that we are fighting on the minority side of the aisle this year. So I am looking forward to hearing what opportunities you see, in spite of the tide of job killing bills that are coming out of this Congress, on how we might repair some of the damage being done these two years, and how we might go forward in a direction that really does solidify a commitment to multiple use on public lands. And again, I am really delighted that you are here. Thank you very much for joining us. Mr. Lujan. Ms. Herseth Sandlin. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE STEPHANIE HERSETH SANDLIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA Ms. Herseth Sandlin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I too want to thank all of our witnesses on the first panel and the second panel for the insights you are offering to our Subcommittee. As I often hear when I visit forest communities in the Black Hills of South Dakota, one of the things that would do the most to create rural jobs while improving both forest health and increasing our energy independence would be to increase the production of renewable energy off of our Federal lands. We have enormous resources here as it relates to biomass, either for co-generation or advanced biofuels. In the Black Hills National Forest, for example, only percent of the , tons of dry slash that is removed from the forest every year, only percent of it is used. The rest of it is piled up and burned. So I think we all can agree that that defies common sense. I mean, I hope we could agree that that defies common sense, in light of energy independence goals, healthy forest management, the amount of time that we can put into a forest plan that can address some of the concerns that some might want to raise without completely eliminating the option and allowing the Department of the Interior to put together the maps, as they have been doing, for where the wind energy may be on Federal lands, where the solar energy may be on Federal lands, where other resources are that we could extract on Federal lands. They should be able to do it for biomass as well. So when we have valuable forest resources going to waste rather than being put to work to create domestic energy and rural jobs, you can imagine the frustration of us since a very inappropriate definition was adapted in December of , instead of an expanded definition for biomass like we successfully passed in the Farm Bill as it relates to renewable biomass. And it would go a long way in addressing this issue. So I look forward to--I know, Mr. Laurance, you include discussion of this in your testimony. I will be interested to hear from our Administration officials if we are any closer to supporting a definition from all of you in support of renewable biomass that works for our Federal forests. And I yield back and thank the Chairman for the recognition. Mr. Lujan. Thank you very much. And I will tell you, as this Congress moves forward to see what needs to be done to make sure we have good partnerships, where we are creating jobs, working on legislation to address the impacts and needs of what has happened in the Gulf, but as we look at energy around the country, there are good partnerships out there, and we are going to hear about some of those today. So with that, I am looking forward to the testimony, and we would like to begin with Mr. Jay Jensen, Deputy Under Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. STATEMENT OF JAY JENSEN, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY, NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Mr. Jensen. Thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting us today to discuss how USDA is using partnerships and collaboration to create jobs and prosperity in rural communities and near public lands. The USDA Forest Service, as the nation's second largest public land manager, manages million acres of forest and grassland, directly providing not only clean air and water, but jobs and livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of Americans. Rural Development, whose $ billion in loans, grants, and guarantees in equates to being one of the largest banks in America, plays an instrumental role in financing essential development for communities in and around our public lands. It is a privilege to be part of this historic partnership that we are charting here, as these two agencies have never worked as closely with common purpose on our forested lands. By building business relationships, we are accelerating innovation and investment, creating jobs and growth, while fostering a stewardship ethic that spans differences among citizens and interests. After recreation on the national forest system lands, which provide , jobs and accounts for over $ billion in gross domestic product, timber management and related production is the second highest economic value derived from Forest Service activities, accounting for approximately . billion in GDP in . Further, we need to update these numbers, but the last comprehensive analysis in of all Forest Service activities found that the agency sustained or maintained more than , jobs and contributed . billion in GDP. Building on this, it is our strong belief that we are on a course to accomplish even more work on national forest system lands today and produce more jobs from those lands over time as the agency carries out the All Lands Landscape-Scale Forest Restoration vision championed by Secretary Vilsack and Forest Service Chief Tidwell. I understand you will hear other testimony today in support of this, and outlining that we can create and maintain on average jobs for $ million invested in forest restoration. It is clear we need to build an economy around forest restoration, a forest restoration economy, if you will. We need to maintain what little forest management infrastructure we have left in our communities, both the human infrastructure and the brick and mortar infrastructure, and build new infrastructure around emerging opportunities and markets like woody bioenergy to economically sustained communities, while simultaneously restoring our forests. The path to get there is through collaboration and partnerships. Community-led efforts are playing a central role in delivering these benefits, while stewardship contracting, and the President's Fiscal Year proposed integrated resources restoration budget line item are key administrative tools to get there. The authority to enter into -year stewardship contracts is particularly important, as it gives the private sector the certainty it needs to finance necessary infrastructure investments. Clear, consistent, and predictable tools are key. Additionally, the $ million integrated resource restoration line item is an essential new tool needed to get more work done, as it allows greater agency flexibility to tailor projects. A prime example of this is our current work in southeast Alaska. The USDA Forest Service and Rural Development are working in partnership to deliver jobs through a transition framework on the Tongass National Forest. Through this framework, a team of agency officials is coordinating with communities and interests to diversify the region's economy and to foster job growth based on a broader suite of forest restoration goods and services than has been attempted in the past. To bridge this transition, the agency is combining existing timber contracts with several long-term stewardship contracts to supply the existing forest products industry. Another example is the Forest Restoration Initiative in Arizona. The initiative is a landscaped-scale restoration effort being collaboratively developed to protect communities from wildfire. Emanating from the successful collaborations that brought us the first major long-term stewardship contract, the , -acre White Mountain Apache-Sitgraves stewardship contract, this second generation collaborative seeks to restore approximately . million acres of ponderosa pine forest. This is exactly the type of effort envisioned by Secretary Vilsack, and provides the kind of predictability needed for business investment. One more example can be found in the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas. Restoration of short-leaf pine, bluestem grass ecosystem habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker has been a focus for several years. But through collaboration and a focus on science-based projects, regular timber sales are occurring, providing a predictable, good supply to the mills in the region. Forest restoration goes hand in hand with economic development. And my testimony today would not be complete without mention of the work supported by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Americans are heading back to work this summer, with the $ . billion provided to the Forest Service as it hits the ground. Hundreds of projects are underway, such as the Woody Biomass Utilization Partnership, a public-private partnership in southwestern Idaho investing . million in sawmills, a pellet mill, and dry kiln infrastructure. And President Obama is serious about jobs on public lands. The recently launched America' Great Outdoors Initiative in predicated on collaboration and partnerships. The agenda is grounded in finding the most successful local initiatives across the country to spur conservation on public lands while simultaneously promoting economic opportunity. These are just a few examples that I was glad to share with you today, and I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you. [The joint prepared statement of Mr. Jensen and Mr. Vasquez follows:] Joint Statement of Victor Vasquez, Deputy Under Secretary, Rural Development, and Jay Jensen, Deputy Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment, United States Department of Agriculture Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting us today to discuss rural job creation and the importance of collaboration among individuals, interest groups, and communities and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development and Forest Service agencies. Today we will discuss the value of partnerships and community collaboration in job creation, and provide examples of successful collaborative economic diversification efforts of the Forest Service and USDA Rural Development throughout the United States. We believe that collaboration can leverage the unique capabilities of each agency; can accelerate our efforts to assist rural communities in creating prosperity and jobs; can develop shared land stewardship through citizen engagement; and can be an effective tool to bridge differences among interest groups and to consider the needs of the public. Our USDA strategy includes working collaboratively across interests and jurisdictions to support locally driven regional economic development strategies, to increase economic opportunity, and improve the quality of life in rural communities. We have held listening sessions around the country to develop ideas to stimulate the economy. These collaborative efforts help create jobs and economic prosperity in renewable energy production, recreation and tourism, regional economic planning, infrastructure development, and natural resource management. RECENT EFFORTS Our agencies accomplish much of our work through collaboration with a diversity of partners, leveraging millions of appropriated dollars annually that creates and maintains rural jobs. Our most recent data for fiscal year , the Forest Service entered into , grants and agreements with partners, under which it contributed $ . billion, and leveraged $ . million, for a total value of partnered efforts of $ . billion. The Forest Service distributed American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of (ARRA) contracts and grants in FY totaling $ . billion. In that same year, including substantial additional investment made possible by the ARRA and leveraged funds, Rural Development provided over $ billion in loans, grants, and loan guarantees for rural housing, community facilities, infrastructure, and business development. SOME EXAMPLES The Southeast Alaska Transition Framework--Last summer, we visited southeast Alaska, visiting native communities and attending listening sessions with local officials and residents. While there, we co-hosted two economic diversity workshops to better understand how USDA can support a diversified economy and range of opportunities for Southeast Alaskan. At the close of these workshops, USDA regional staff committed to hold similar workshops in every community in Southeast Alaska; those sessions have brought about new ideas and possibilities for leveraging the agencies of the USDA and have become a blueprint for Rural Development and the Forest Service to work in local communities all across the nation. The following initiative was the result of this trip. The Forest Service and Rural Development in Southeast Alaska have formed a team to help local communities transition to a broader economic base, based on a suite of goods and services that can provide diversified jobs and community stability, where timber historically provided the backbone. The transition is based on shifting management emphasis towards multi-year stewardship contracts and young growth management. This strategy is supported by both the timber industry and environmental groups as a way to maintain the health and diversity of the forest, and meet market demand. The USDA team will coordinate with State and local governments, tribal entities, local stakeholders, non-profit and for- profit organizations to diversify economic opportunity and create and maintain jobs on a broader suite of goods and services. The first of several long-term stewardship contracts will be implemented by the Forest Service in which will give the existing forest products industry the needed supply to maintain current jobs while Rural Development works to retool and transition to the new framework. Next steps include development of a Strategic Plan, infusion of Rural Development program funding, and targeting business and infrastructure needs to help stimulate growth of new businesses and job creation. The Appalachian Regional Development Initiative--Rural Development is collaborating with the Forest Service, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and a host of additional federal agencies on the Appalachian Regional Development Initiative, which seeks to provide federal support for regional economic development efforts across Appalachia, including those focused on sustainable natural resource development, recreation and tourism, and green job creation. Over the past six months, an Interagency Working Group hosted five listening sessions across the Appalachian region to gather feedback from local stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities to diversifying and strengthening their regional economies. The Working Group gathered additional public comments through an online outreach page, and a team of government economists crafted a holistic assessment of the region's economic assets and challenges to development in the region. In the coming months, we will announce a new federal strategy for supporting development efforts in Appalachia, focusing on supporting comprehensive, community-driven planning with sustainable natural resource development. Stewardship Contracting--The Forest Service through stewardship contracting has the ability to enter into -year contracts, enhancing industry's ability to create and maintain jobs. The private sector now has the kind of certainty needed to work closely with financial institutions to secure the types of loans and financing to build the infrastructure needed, both human and brick and mortar, to economically sustain communities while simultaneously restoring our forests. Stewardship contracts help meet local and rural community needs through collaborative planning and implementation and contribute to the sustainability of rural communities by improving forest health and natural resource resiliency, providing opportunities for local income and employment, and fostering greater public involvement in project stages. In FY , the Forest Service entered into stewardship agreements and contracts on , acres, including vegetation treatments for product, health, and fuels reduction, wildlife habitat and watershed improvement, road improvement, and utilization of forest biomass for energy production. The President's FY budget supports the use of this tool to facilitate greater accomplishment in the forest and greater economic development in communities. Secure Rural Schools--The Forest Service will have Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act Resource Advisory Committees (RACS) fully functional by the end of the year in states. These groups collectively select projects that will benefit national forests and nearby communities. Oftentimes, these projects are contracted, and thus, help local communities economically. In selecting the projects, RAC committees collaboratively learn each other's views, interests and desires for national forest management and come to agreement on projects to recommend. The result has been an unequivocal success. Investment in such a collaborative process is a key ingredient to finding project success. As testament, not one project selected by RACS for funding has ever been appealed or litigated. National Forest Scenic Byways Program--Two of the goals of the National Forest Scenic Byways Program are to support and enhance rural community economic development, and to increase public awareness and understanding of national forest activities and the importance of sustaining healthy, productive ecosystems. The National Forest Scenic Byways Program, with national forest scenic byways, is a success because it unites rural communities, empowers collaboration among diverse partners, and offers travelers a way to ``make the journey as important as the destination.'' We have found that tourism can be greatly increased as well. On the Kangamanus Scenic Byway in the White Mountain National Forest, approximately to million visitors enjoy scenic overlooks, hiking trails, and numerous historic sites. After Scenic Byway designation, local communities, citizens, and forest officials forge agreements on signage, tourism facilities, and roadside attractions and stops. Oftentimes, the new relationships prove to be a catalyst for new marketing and funding opportunities available through the National Scenic Byways Program and State transportation agencies. The emphasis on promoting community tourism has been one of the most popular aspects of byway designation with rural communities. America's Great Outdoors Initiative--President Obama announced in April of this year his America's Great Outdoor Initiative to help craft a conservation agenda for the st Century. Administration officials are traveling across the country this summer to hear ideas, issues, problems, and solutions directly from local communities. This agenda is grounded in finding the most successful initiatives from across the country to spur conservation of our public and private land resources while simultaneously promoting economic opportunities. In fulfilling America's Great Outdoor Initiative, Secretary Vilsack and the USDA are finding that outdoor recreation provides opportunities for Americans to participate in stewardship activities. Recently, Secretary Vilsack highlighted how outdoor recreation on National Forests and Grasslands alone directly provides , jobs and contributes over . billion to the economy. The outdoor economy is particularly important to rural America. Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR)--The President's fiscal year budget emphasizes a new line item called Integrated Resource Restoration. The new line item has tremendous potential to create and maintain jobs through projects that are developed in collaboration with partners and communities. Recent studies show that for every one million invested in forest restoration and timber work on public lands, nearly jobs are created. \ \ This is one of the highest returns on the dollar of any federal investment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Max Nielsen-Pincus & Cassandra Mosely, Economic and Employment Impacts of Forest and Watershed Restoration in Oregon, in Institute for a Sustainable Environment, Ecosystem Workforce Program, Working Paper Number . (Spring, : University of Oregon Press). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Four-Forest Restoration Initiative, Arizona--National forest managers in northern Arizona have been working for years to reduce the threat of high-intensity, potentially-destructive wildfires to neighboring communities through a variety of means. The -Forest Restoration Initiative ( FRI), involving the Apache-Sitgraves, Coconino, Kaibab, and Tonto National Forests, will provide economic opportunities to local communities through the utilization of small- diameter forest products, and is aimed at collaboratively designing a multi-decade restoration program. The project will use a variety of tools, including mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, to achieve landscape-scale forest restoration. Because of the landscape-scale of this restoration (approximately . million acres of ponderosa pine forest), the FRI is expected to lead to as many as , acres per year being treated over a -year period. This will reduce treatment costs and provide restoration-based work opportunities that will create long-term, quality jobs. This initiative will restore watershed health, improve wildlife habitat, conserve biodiversity, protect old-growth, restore forest structure and function, reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildland fire, and reintroduce natural fire into the ecosystem. Northeast Washington Forestry Coalition--The Northeast Washington Forestry Coalition (NEWFC) is a collaborative group formed in . The ``coalition'' is composed of representatives from environmental groups, the timber industry, forestry consultants, academics, and a wide range of other interests. The coalition has worked collaboratively with Colville National Forest staff on project level planning that has resulted in projects being implemented without appeal or litigation on the Colville National Forest. This is an important accomplishment that helps maintain jobs. The NEWFC objectives include: demonstrating the full potential of restoration forestry to enhance forest health, public safety and community economic vitality; designing and implementing forest restoration and fuels reduction which demonstrate innovative approaches to forestry; and demonstrating how a diverse coalition of stakeholders can work together to successfully promote restoration forestry and community protection from wildfire. The NEWFC has engaged the local community and the larger ``natural resource'' community by bringing groups together based on common interests of forest health. The keys to the success of this process have been in the early engagement of groups and in extensive site- specific field visits. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) ARRA's greatest impact is still ahead of us. The summer will be the most active season yet. The Forest Service was appropriated $ . billion for wildland fire management and capital improvement and maintenance projects in FY . With nearly all the money obligated, Americans are being put back to work. For Wildland Fire Management, an estimated , direct jobs were created, and for Capital Improvement and Maintenance, estimated direct jobs equals , . For Wildland Fire Management, projects have been completed for $ million, and capital improvement and maintenance projects totaled $ million for projects. Examples of the program benefits include the creation of jobs in economically distressed areas, fuels reduction work, and the completion of numerous facility improvement, maintenance and renovation projects. Woody Biomass Utilization Partnership (ARRA)--The Forest Service has been instrumental in promoting wood utilization in southwest Idaho. Much of this work is being accomplished through the Woody Biomass Utilization Partnership (WBUP), a successful public-private partnership funded by the Idaho Department of Commerce; Adams, Boise, Gem and Valley Counties; the Forest Service and other federal grants, and private industry. The mission of the WBUP is to work with the private sector to promote woody biomass supply, to identify and develop markets, to develop mechanisms and acquire equipment to get supply to those markets and to promote product and organizational development that will aid in the development of woody biomass businesses and markets. The Partnership successfully competed for ARRA grants totaling $ . million to private businesses, including $ million to Emerald Forest Products to complete construction of a sawmill and shavings plant that will create approximately full time jobs. Of the grants, $ . million went to the Garden Valley school system in Boise County for conversion of the school's heating system to a woody biomass fueled plant. $ . million went to Evergreen Forest Products in Adams County for installation of a dry kiln at a local saw mill, resulting in the retention of at least jobs in the County. Finally, $ , went to Treasure Valley Forest Products in Elmore County to expand its pellet mill, adding new jobs at the mill. LESSONS LEARNED AND FUTURE NEEDS The diversity of collaborative efforts is growing. Clearly, one- size-fits-all approach is not always effective; communities and opportunities differ, and many of the strongest projects are conceived, principally financed, and led by partners in the private sector, the non-profit community, and local government. We have had great successes and believe that Regional efforts compound efficiency and energies. For example, in situations where interested individuals are engaged in the shared stewardship of their public lands, the Forest Service has a marked decline in both the incidence and costs associated with formal dispute, appeals, and lawsuits (as noted in the FY Environmental Conflict Resolution Report to OMB-CEQ, February ). Collaboration and partnerships take time, but often deliver long-term benefits and healthier communities. USDA is working to improve both internal and external communications, enhance transparency and accountability, strengthen collaboration, and increase the ability of programs to reach flexibly across traditional Mission Area boundaries. CONCLUSION Our future success depends on working together--as communities sharing mutual interests, and as partners. The reality of federal budget constraints will create efficiencies, and collaboration will become more important than ever to find, create and leverage partnerships and private sector investments. Our successful collaborative efforts demonstrate that job creation, employment maintenance, and direct and indirect economic benefits are gained through these partnership efforts. In addition, community stability and cohesiveness, and important resource and infrastructure enhancement can be accomplished through partnership. We should make every effort to continue to support and expand these collaborative partnership efforts. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss these programs with the Subcommittee. We would be happy to answer any questions you may have. ______ Mr. Lujan. Thank you very much, Mr. Jensen. And Mr. Victor Vasquez, Deputy Under Secretary, Rural Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture. STATEMENT OF VICTOR VASQUEZ, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Mr. Vasquez. Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, I want to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to discuss USDA Rural Development's commitment to creating jobs and assisting in creating vibrant growing communities in rural America. I am very pleased to be here with Deputy Under Secretary Jay Jensen representing the Forest Service, our sister agency. A healthy American economy depends on a prosperous rural America. Rural America supplies much of our nation's food, water, and safeguards our environmental heritage. Its role in establishing our nation's energy independence is growing every day, and our values are rooted in rural America. USDA Rural Development is committed to the future of rural communities; so, too, is the Forest Service. At Rural Development, we understand clearly that we cannot succeed if we work alone. We administer over programs that provide electric, telecommunications, broadband service, water and waste water, affordable housing, essential community services, and business development assistance to rural communities, residents, and businesses. Everything we do, without exception, is in support of our local partners. Last year, and Mr. Jensen alluded to this, we provided over $ billion in loans, grants, and loan guarantees, every penny of which represents an investment by us in the success of others. Our success is not measured by anything we achieve ourselves. It is measured by the success of our partners. From that perspective, let me say simply that collaboration is a core value at Rural Development. Sustainable development also rests on a hard look at economic assets and opportunities. Federal grants and loans can jump start projects, but that alone cannot sustain communities over the long haul. One of our planning objectives is to encourage coherent regions with a commonality of interests to develop a first-rate, analytical perspective on the region's comparative economic advantages, and a realistic picture of economic drivers that can work for the region as a whole. From this perspective, we recognize that rural communities working in isolation are far less effective than multi- community, multi-county collaborations that can pull resources, rationalize infrastructure investment, and efficiently deliver services. One of our goals is therefore to encourage and incentivize communities to participate in such cooperative efforts. And to support that effort, we are currently engaged in building a significantly upgraded community and economic development capacity within rural development itself. We have traditionally been very effective in supporting individual projects. Going forward, we want to ensure that each of the projects we fund is clearly placed within the context of a coherent community, a regional strategic plan, in order to maximize the return. There are a number of compelling examples of such regional collaborations. One was mentioned earlier, and provided in our written testimony, the Southeast Alaska Transition Framework, where we are collaborating with the Forest Service to assist communities in developing a more diversified economic base. In the dry forest zone in eastern Oregon and California, we have entered into a cooperative agreement with a nonprofit organization called Sustainable Northwest. This partnership is developing a regional model to increase the viability of sustainable forestry in rural communities. Sustainable Northwest will be conducting workshops and facilitating coordination among partners and stakeholders. They will be helping to generate increased private sector investment and sustainable, renewable energy generated from biomass. Two thousand miles to the east, we are collaborating again with the Forest Service through the Appalachia Regional Commission and a host of additional Federal agencies on the Appalachia Regional Development Initiative, which seeks to provide Federal support for regional economic development efforts across Appalachia, including those focused on sustainable natural resource development, recreation and tourism, and green job creation. On a national scale, we are working with four regional rural development centers to develop a new initiative called Stronger Economies Together, or SET. This program will provide training and technical assistance to local communities and counties that are working together in a multi-county planning effort. The opportunities are there. The rural residents I have spoken with often say that at this point in time, there is more potential for economic growth in rural America than at any time in the past. Rural broadband, rural energy, renewable energy, the quality of life advances in transportation infrastructure, tourism and recreation, the agricultural and natural resources base, local and regional food system networks, emerging ecosystem markets--all of these are viable foundations for economic growth and creating jobs. Our job is to make it happen. USDA is working at President Obama's direction to build a new rural economy, a more sustainable economy, with green jobs that can't be exported, an economy that better values conservation and the environment, an economy that offers a future for rural residents and their family. We are committed to the future of rural communities, and I know that we all in this room are as well. And I want to thank you for the honor of being here today. Thank you. [The joint prepared statement of Mr. Vasquez can be found on .] Mr. Lujan. Thank you very much. And we are going to need to take a quick recess to go vote. We have one vote, and we will be right back. So I thank you very much for your patience. With that, one vote, and we will be right back. Thank you. [Recess.] Mr. Grijalva [presiding]. Thank you very much. Let us reconvene the Subcommittee meeting, and let me thank my good friend from New Mexico, Mr. Lujan, for assuming the responsibilities of starting the hearing. Thank you very much. We were interrupted by myself and the Ranking Member, Mr. Bishop, were busy with marking up oil spills and children's nutrition, and my apologies for not being here on time when the hearing began. [The prepared statement of Chairman Grijalva follows:] Statement of The Honorable Raul Grijalva, Chairman, Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands The Subcommittee will now come to order. Thank you. There are some old misconceptions about federal lands in the west and the agencies which manage them. Some assert that our public lands are job killers, and that federal land managers want to seize private land, halt industries and harm rural economies. These accusations are wrong, and they undermine western communities by framing their struggles as a choice between economic development and conservation. That is a false choice which ignores the many communities that are successfully doing both. The witnesses we have before us today have a different perspective - one that isn't so black and white, and one that stands in sharp contrast to this rhetoric. And given that these folks actually live in the west, we would be well served to listen. Their response to the challenges in their western towns is not to pick a fight and lay blame, but rather to promote solutions. Their approach is not to tear things down, but rather to build consensus--and even collaborate with old adversaries. And their goal is to apply the principle that the long-term health of the public land and the well being of our rural communities are linked. We will hear today from public land managers and county commissioners, ranchers and environmentalists, small business owners and educators. And they will tell us about the ways that they are working together to chart a new path to prosperity. . .using our public lands. I know this has not been an easy road at times--especially in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But for those communities that were dependent on just one commodity for their development, this evolution is critical. We look forward to hearing your stories today - but we also need to learn from them. So, I also invite the witnesses to share with us the challenges and obstacles you have faced in implementing your projects. I want to hear your frustrations, but, more importantly, I want your input on how we can better support your efforts. Whether during a round up, battling a wildfire, or confronting a flood, rural communities are well-suited to team-work - and they have always persevered. Today as they forge novel partnerships--to create sustainable jobs, revive communities, and restore our unique western landscape--they are writing a new, and promising, chapter in the rich history of the American west. I want to thank all the witnesses for traveling so far today, in what I know is a busy time of year, to join us here in this humidity! I understand that Mrs. Troy, who is on our third panel, left a Salmon River rafting trip early to come testify. Now, that IS sacrifice! So, thank you. I look forward to hearing from you all today. And I now turn to the Ranking Member, Mr. Bishop, for any opening comments he may have. ______ Mr. Grijalva Deputy Assistant Secretary Sobeck, Fish and Wildlife and Parks, U.S. Department of the Interior, thank you. The time is yours. STATEMENT OF EILEEN SOBECK, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE AND PARKS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ACCOMPANIED BY MICHAEL J. POOLE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, AND JOSEPH LAURANCE Ms. Sobeck. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee. I am pleased to have received the opportunity to testify today on the important role that lands managed by the Department of the Interior play in economic growth and the creation and support of private sector jobs. I am joined here today by Mike Poole, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Land Management, and Dan Wenk, Deputy Director of the National Park Service. I would like to submit our written testimony for the record, and summarize our testimony in our statement here today. The Department of the Interior is the steward of vast amounts of our nation's natural resources and cultural heritage. Resources managed by the Department, including by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation, are economic engines for the communities that surround them throughout the country. In our role as steward, the Department has played and continues to play a vital role in renewing our economy and creating and supporting jobs that cannot be exported. We are creating jobs for thousands of young people, protecting our most treasured places, and inspiring the next generation to be good stewards of our lands and waters. Our national parks, national wildlife refuges, and public lands are supporting recreation and tourism jobs in gateway communities across the country. And the Department is moving to harness wind, solar, and geothermal power from public lands, putting Americans to work while supplying clean, affordable energy for our future. We are leading by example and demonstrating how the wise stewardship of our landscapes is critical to our economic well- being. This is particularly true in rural areas. In a first of its kind economic report issued by the Secretary in February, it was estimated that in those states that are more than percent rural, visitors to Interior sites support , jobs and $ . billion in economic activity. Communities surrounding the largest units of the national park system had on average almost four times faster population growth, almost three times faster job growth, and two times growth in real income than the Nation overall. The report also noted that conservation activities can generate large numbers of jobs relative to other investments of government funding. For example, every $ million invested in ecosystem restoration projects was estimated to support up to mostly private sector jobs. Every $ million invested in recreation projects was estimated to support up to mostly private sector jobs. The Department could not accomplish its mission without the collaboration and cooperation of a wide range of stakeholders. My written testimony highlights several ongoing Administration initiatives that are supporting the creation of rural jobs, including the Administration's Great Outdoors Initiative, the Youth and the Great Outdoors Initiative, our commitment to build a clean energy economy, and the creation of the Landscape Conservation Cooperative. And my written testimony shares several specific examples of successful collaborative conservation projects. The America Great Outdoors Initiative, I would like to say just a few words about that. It has started a much needed dialogue about conservation in our nation. As part of this initiative, our Department, along with several others, is hosting listening sessions around the country to hear from ranchers, farmers, forest landowners, sportsmen and -women, state and local government leaders, tribal leaders, public lands experts, conservationists, recreationists, youth leaders, business representatives, heritage preservationists, and others to learn about some of the smart, creative ways that communities are conserving outdoor spaces and helping Americans go out and enjoy them. Today, as we speak, Administration officials are assembled in Asheville, North Carolina to gather such public input. I myself attended a session in Grand Island, Nebraska on Monday, and I can assure you that we were listening there. Listening sessions will continue throughout the summer as part of our commitment to reach out to communities for good ideas about conservation. We are going into this process with open minds, and we are eager to learn about the efforts that ordinary Americans are making to conserve our land, water and wildlife. Our goal is to develop a conservation agenda for the st century that will incorporate and promote every positive aspect of conservation, including the creation of conservation-related job. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement, and I look forward to hearing the rest of the testimony and answering your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Sobeck follows:] Statement of Eileen Sobeck, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, U.S. Department of the Interior Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the important role that the lands managed by the Department of the Interior play in economic growth and the creation of private sector jobs tied to the landscape. The Department of the Interior is the steward of our nation's natural resources and cultural heritage. Resources managed by the Department, including by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service (NPS), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), are economic engines for communities around the country. In our role as steward, the Department has played, and continues to play, a vital role in renewing our economy and creating jobs that cannot be exported. We are creating jobs for thousands of young people, protecting our most treasured places and inspiring the next generation to be good stewards of our lands and waters. Our national parks, refuges and public lands are supporting recreation and tourism jobs in gateway communities across the country. And, the Department is moving to harness wind, solar and geothermal power from public lands, putting Americans to work while supplying clean, affordable energy for our future. We are leading by example, demonstrating how the wise stewardship of our landscapes is critical to our economic well-being. Of course, the Department could not accomplish its mission without the collaboration and cooperation of a wide range of stakeholders. We take pride in the relationships we have built with gateway communities throughout the country. We have embraced partnerships and active engagement to find common ground, and to conserve and make use of our natural resources. Community-based partnerships are essential to accomplishing land management goals and can help create new economic opportunities for local businesses. Each year, the Department supports hundreds of partner organizations who participate in a wide variety of projects and efforts at the community, landscape, and national levels. Economic Impact In February of this year, Secretary Salazar released to the public and shared with Members of Congress a first-of-its-kind departmental report estimating that Interior programs and activities support more than . million private sector American jobs and more than $ billion in economic activity across the country. The report, entitled ``Economic Impact of the Department of the Interior's Programs and Activities,'' indicates that the Department creates and supports private sector jobs and economic growth in all states. Furthermore, the report underscores the importance of investing in conservation and energy development, and the role these fields can play in getting our economy moving again. The Economic Impact Report found that rural states especially benefit from Interior's programs and activities. In states that are more than percent rural, it was estimated that visitors to Interior sites support , jobs and $ . billion in economic activity. For example, many of our national parks are located in remote, rural areas. Economic effects of parks on remote, gateway communities can be significant. One study found that communities surrounding the largest units of the National Park System had, on average, almost four times faster population growth, almost three times faster job growth, and two times faster growth in real income than the nation overall. (Power, T.M. ``The Economic Foundations of Public Parks.'' The George Wright Forum, ) The Economic Impact Report also noted that conservation activities can generate large numbers of jobs relative to other investments of government funding. For example, every $ million taxpayers invest in ecosystem restoration projects was estimated to create up to mostly private-sector jobs. Every $ million invested in recreation projects was estimated to support up to mostly private-sector jobs. While federally funded ecosystem restoration and recreation activities can support substantial numbers of jobs, the actual number of jobs supported by an individual project will vary based on that project's particular circumstances. In testifying before you today, I would like to highlight several ongoing Administration initiatives that are supporting the creation of rural jobs. I would particularly like to discuss the Administration's Great Outdoors Initiative, the Youth in the Great Outdoors Initiative, our commitment to building a clean energy economy, and the creation of the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. I will also share with you several examples of successful collaborative conservation projects. The America's Great Outdoors Initiative On April , , President Barack Obama signed a Presidential Memorandum establishing the America's Great Outdoors Initiative to promote and support innovative community-level efforts to conserve outdoor spaces and to reconnect Americans to the outdoors. President Obama inaugurated the America's Great Outdoors Initiative at a White House Conference held at the Department in April. The conference brought together leaders from communities across the country that are working to protect their outdoor spaces and focused on developing and supporting innovative ideas for improving conservation and recreation at the local level. The America's Great Outdoors Initiative has started a much-needed dialogue about conservation in our Nation. As part of this initiative, the Department is hosting listening sessions around the country to hear from ranchers, farmers and forest landowners, sportsmen and women, state and local government leaders, tribal leaders, public-lands experts, conservationists, recreationists, youth leaders, business representatives, heritage preservationists, and others to learn about some of the smart, creative ways communities are conserving outdoor spaces and helping Americans to go out and enjoy them. Sessions have already been hosted in Montana, Maryland, South Carolina, Washington, California, and Nebraska. Today, as we speak, Administration officials are assembled in Asheville, North Carolina, to gather public input. Listening sessions will continue throughout the summer, as part of the Administration's commitment to reaching out to communities for good ideas about conservation. We are going into this process with open minds, eager to learn about the efforts that ordinary Americans are making to conserve our land, water and wildlife. Our goal is to develop a conservation agenda for the st Century - an agenda that will incorporate and promote every positive aspect of conservation, including the creation of conservation-related jobs. Youth in the Great Outdoors Initiative The Secretary's Youth in the Great Outdoors Initiative is forging connections between a new generation of Americans and the outdoors, introducing youth to the career opportunities associated with our tremendous landscapes, and very often carrying out maintenance projects in our parks, forests, refuges, and other public land units. As part of this initiative, young adults gain valuable experience, while meeting important Departmental needs. By joining conservation corps or filling temporary positions, young people help maintain and enhance trails, restore native plants while removing invasive species, and provide the public with educational information about the public lands. At the FWS Great Lakes/Big Rivers Region, for example, youth work directly with fisheries resource professionals performing the daily duties and special projects necessary for FWS to accomplish its mission of protecting and enhancing aquatic species and their habitats, including caring for fish, building trails, maintaining grounds and facilities, and learning about daily activities at a fish hatchery. This year, the Department will employ at least , youth--a percent increase over the , employed in . The Department also indirectly employs youth through other organizations, leveraging funding and human resources to impact more youth by providing them with meaningful employment opportunities. Similarly, the Department partners with numerous organizations throughout the country, including YMCA and Boys and Girls Clubs, to engage youth through education and recreation programs related to our public lands.. The importance of the Youth in the Great Outdoors Initiative is reflected in the FY budget proposal, which includes large increases not only in employment of teens and young adults ages - but also in education and recreation programs that engage youth of all ages. Renewables As part of securing America's energy future, we must move our nation towards a clean energy economy. At the Department, this means changing the way we do business by opening our doors to responsible renewable energy development on our public lands. We are facilitating environmentally-appropriate renewable energy projects involving solar, wind and waves, geothermal, biofuels and hydropower. These resources, developed in the right ways and the right places, will help curb our dependence on foreign oil, reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote new industries here in America. The development of these renewable energy sources will also create jobs in local communities. The Milford Wind Corridor, in Milford, Utah is an example of one of these renewable energy projects. Secretary Salazar recently announced that construction will begin soon on Phase of the Milford Wind Corridor, which the BLM approved earlier this year. When completed, Phase will consist of turbines with the capacity to produce megawatts of electricity. Construction is scheduled to begin this month and be completed by the end of the year. The first phase of the Milford Wind Corridor consists of wind turbines that have been generating commercial power since November , producing megawatts of electricity sold to the Southern California Public Power Authority. That's enough energy to power , homes. To date First Wind has invested more than $ million in the Phase project, which has created more than development and construction jobs and resulted in more than $ million in economic benefit to Utah. The Arizona Restoration Design Energy Project is another innovative example of the Department's work to facilitate appropriately-sited renewable energy development. The BLM's Arizona State Office has engaged local communities in this unique, forward-looking partnership to identify Arizona sites that have already been disturbed (such as abandoned mines, landfills, and brownfields) and that could support renewable energy development. Nominations have come from the BLM, other Federal agencies, tribal, state, county and local governments. Privately owned lands were nominated as well. The BLM, along with the many Federal and state agencies that have joined as cooperating agencies, has taken the information and begun work on a programmatic environmental impact statement that will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of developing such lands. This innovative project is intended to identify potential development sites for which there are fewer competing uses and values, while providing conservation benefits by taking development pressure off lands with higher resource values. The many construction, maintenance, and operation jobs that result from renewable energy development on such sites would provide additional tangible benefits to local communities as well as the regional economy. And just last week, the Department entered into an agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop a -square mile Solar Demonstration Zone on federal lands in Nevada to demonstrate cutting- edge solar energy technologies. This Solar Demonstration Zone will be located in the southwest corner of the Nevada Test Site, a former nuclear site, on lands owned by the BLM and administered by DOE. Before selecting the site for the Solar Demonstration Zone, the federal government consulted with relevant stakeholders, including state, tribal, and local governments, as well as local utilities. DOE and the Department will continue collaborating to effectively implement the project, which will serve as proving grounds for new solar technologies, providing a critical link between DOE's advanced technology development and full-scale commercialization efforts. Landscape Conservation Cooperatives Initiative The Landscape Conservation Cooperatives initiative is based on ecosystem-based multi-stakeholder, multi-jurisdictional partnerships across the country. It is focused on addressing existing and emerging natural resources management challenges including climate change, and promotes geographically-based, landscape scale conservation planning. The Department has begun, with its partners, to put in place Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). These cooperatives will facilitate regional conservation planning along with the Department's regional Climate Science Centers (CSCs). The CSCs and the LCCs will conduct and communicate research and monitoring to improve the understanding and forecasting of which elements of Department-managed land, water, marine, fish, wildlife, and cultural heritage resources are most vulnerable to climate change impacts and other environmental stressors, and how to make them more resilient. The CSCs will provide basic climate change science associated with broad regions of the country, and LCCs will focus more on applied science at the landscape level. Both CSCs and LCCs will be involved in integrating and disseminating data and helping resource managers develop adaptation strategies. LCCs will enable resource management agencies and organizations to collaborate in an integrated fashion within and across land ownerships. LCCs will provide scientific and technical support to inform conservation using adaptive management principles and will engage in biological planning, conservation design, inventory and monitoring program design, and other types of conservation-based scientific research planning and coordination. LCCs will play an important role in helping partners establish common goals and priorities, so they can be more efficient and effective in targeting the right science in the right places. In creating the LCCs, the Department has undertaken an unprecedented level of outreach to partners at federal, state, tribal, local, and private levels, through workshops, web seminars, and other venues. Progress achieved to date illustrates not only the commitment, enthusiasm and dedication with which the Department has pursued this task, but also the success the Department has achieved in attracting partners to participate in LCCs. The USGS, FWS, NPS, BOR, BLM and BIA are fully participating in this effort and have committed funding and staff support beginning in to the CSCs in order to encourage collaborative sharing of research results and data and to provide a direct link with the on-the ground work taking place in the LCCs. These partners and others will leverage resources available for climate change science. Collaborative Projects Finally, I would like to share with you some examples of the other types of collaborative projects that are being carried out by Department bureaus. These examples include projects that were recognized this year by the Secretary for excellence in conservation partnerships. This year, projects representing the work of more than groups and individuals nationwide were recognized with the Department's Partners in Conservation Awards. The Wyoming Front Aspen Stewardship Project The Wyoming Front Aspen Stewardship Project seeks to restore and maintain aspen stands that provide important large game habitat. This project began in September through an Assistance Agreement between the BLM's Pinedale Field Office and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and encompasses , acres of BLM lands. The project involves harvesting marketable products (sawlogs, Christmas trees, fuelwood, and biomass) during the summer months, while leaving a fuel bed on over percent of the unit. During the following spring, prescribed fire is used to reduce the fuel loads and enhance aspen regeneration. Since , three timber sales have taken place to reduce conifer encroachment into aspen stands. Totaling over acres and $ , in receipts, these forest health projects have generated over one million board feet of timber products, , tons of biomass material, and , Christmas trees. Work within the project area has been conducted on a total of , acres, totaling $ , . Combined, these projects have employed people. For FY and the BLM contributed $ , for project implementation, with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation contributing $ , , Wyoming Game & Fish contributing $ , , and the Wyoming Wildlife Natural Resource Trust providing $ , . New Mexico Candidate Conservation Agreements The BLM's Pecos District and New Mexico State Office, working with their counterparts in the FWS, have engaged stakeholders in the New Mexico ranching and oil and gas industries to launch a conservation agreement program created specifically for lease holders on public lands. In this innovative program, landowners, energy companies and ranchers join the agencies in protecting and restoring habitat for two candidates for Federal listing in southeast New Mexico, the lesser prairie chicken and sand dune lizard. The agencies work with the Center of Excellence for Hazardous Materials Management to administer voluntary Candidate Conservation Agreements for oil and gas lease holders on Federal lands and Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances for state and private landowners to benefit the species. In return, in the event that one or both species are listed under the Endangered Species Act, companies and individuals operating on private lands receive assurances that their operations can continue, and operators on Federal lands receive a much greater degree of certainty that their operations would likewise continue. Over a dozen ranchers and two energy companies are taking actions under the program to reduce or eliminate threats to the species on all land ownership types. These efforts have produced conservation benefits, provided operational and job security in the ranching and oil and gas industries, and created new jobs in habitat restoration. The BLM estimates that - jobs will be created in the reclamation of abandoned oil field sites (dirt moving, site remediation, etc.) and restoration of habitat for the species by a variety of vegetative treatments (e.g., aerial spraying and mechanical treatments). Anchorage Youth Employment in Parks Program The Anchorage Youth Employment in Parks Program engages youth in career opportunities and outdoor experiences to protect and restore fish and wildlife and their habitats. This robust collaboration among the FWS, the Anchorage Park Foundation, the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska Youth for Environmental Action, and over public and private organizations is reaching out to youth in populations underrepresented in natural resource management jobs to foster the next generation of public land stewards through natural resources training, habitat restoration, and protection projects and outdoor activities. Every year over three dozen youth from Anchorage area schools are employed as crewmembers to build new trails, repair fishing platforms, improve public access to fishing and recreational areas, rehabilitate stream banks, replant riparian landscapes, clean up creeks, maintain rain gardens, and implement riparian forest health protection projects to help reduce habitat loss from destructive and invasive spruce bark beetles. These projects further the mission of the Department, support the goal to connect youth to nature, and help the FWS meet its trust responsibilities for migratory birds, pacific salmon, and other inter- jurisdictional fish. In recognition of its achievements in collaborative conservation, this program received a Partners in Conservation Award from the Department this year. Circle of Flight Program In , the Bureau of Indian Affairs Circle of Flight Program, provided support to tribes and two tribal organizations that collaborated with other government and private entities in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin to protect, restore, and/or enhance , acres of wetlands; restore and/or re-seed , acres of wild rice; establish, plant, and maintain acres of upland waterfowl nesting cover and prairie grasslands; construct and install waterfowl nesting structures; and conduct valuable waterfowl habitat research. The Program's many projects encouraged Native American youth to get involved in a number of activities, including wild rice planting, harvesting seeds, monitoring, and data collecting. In this way, these young people experience traditional ties to the land and natural resources while gaining appreciation for their treasured natural environment. These projects not only help Native Americans exercise traditional and cultural uses of the natural environment, but also give all citizens greater opportunity to enjoy our natural resources and natural heritage. In recognition of its achievements in collaborative conservation, this program received a Partners in Conservation Award from the Department this year.. Modoc County, California Partnership Through its partnership with the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service, Modoc County, CA, is developing and implementing the Sage Steppe Ecosystem Restoration Strategy to restore the health of public land in a . million acre planning area for the benefit of the residents of Modoc County and the people of the United States. The partnership is working to improve the condition of the public land while providing for rural economic development and domestic energy production on thousands of acres within the . million-acre, multi-jurisdictional planning area. In recognition of its achievements in collaborative conservation, this partnership received a Partners in Conservation Award from the Department this year.. Conclusion Our national parks, refuges and public lands continue to be economically important to rural communities throughout the West. In these areas, land use activities, such as grazing, mining and forestry, remain key sources of rural jobs and income. At the same time, uses such as outdoor recreation and conservation have gained, and continue to gain, in economic importance to rural communities. The collaborative spirit is at the heart of the initiatives supported by the Administration. Our ability to successfully achieve our mission depends upon our ability to work collaboratively with gateway communities and other stakeholders, and partnerships are a key component in this success. Through our partnerships, the Department is working to resolve conflicts over land management, put good conservation practices in place on the ground, contribute to economic opportunities in our Nation and our communities, and create jobs for the American people. ______ Mr. Grijalva. Thank you very much, Madame Secretary. Let me now ask Mr. Joseph Laurance, Douglas County Commissioner, Roseburg, Oregon. Welcome, and, Mr. Commissioner, the time is yours. STATEMENT OF JOSEPH A. LAURANCE, DOUGLAS COUNTY COMMISSIONER, ROSEBURG, OREGON Mr. Laurance. And good morning, and thank you, Chairman Grijalva, Ranking Member Bishop, and members of the Subcommittee. I am Joe Laurance, County Commissioner for Douglas County, Oregon. My county is a little larger than the State of Connecticut, has the largest and oldest stands of Douglas fir timber in the world. When I left home Monday, five forest fires were burning on the million-acre Umpqua National Forest. I need your help to save my forest, and your forest as well. The NACo Resolution you find in today's written testimony can do that if you care as deeply as I do for this nation's forests. Twenty years and days ago, the Northern Spotted Owl was listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. It was then thought that loss of old growth habitat through logging was the culprit causing a declining population. In response, Federal timber harvests were vastly curtailed. The Umpqua National Forest in my county saw an annual harvest of million board feet in reduced to million board feet in . In the years since, a policy of benevolent neglect of Federal lands has seen Spotted Owl numbers continue to decline through habitat destruction caused by increasingly numerous and intense forest fires, and through predation by the Barred Owl, which favors this new unmanaged forest habitat. Federal policy, which has been multiple use of the forest with an emphasis on industrial harvest, sought a new strategy, which has yet to be formulated in all of these intervening years. The resolution presented to you provides that needed new strategy, not only for Oregon, but for all of our nation's Federal forests, from Appalachia to Alaska. Federal forest managers would now have a clearly defined desired forest condition that must be obtained within a specified time. If this becomes the intent of Congress, the Forest Service with BLM would join with private industry to restore forest health and rural economies without drawing on the national treasury. The plan I describe would restore your forest and mine to the natural historic condition created by American Indians through , years of applied ingenuity. That forest was one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems ever known. It was created by fire, yet protected from fire. A , -acre study nearing completion on the Umpqua Forest will show precisely what the natural historic condition was immediately prior to European-American habitation. The study area would seem to be an excellent candidate as a pilot project to provide specific information related to healthy forest restoration, as envisioned by the resolution I have described. The resolution anticipates that significant volumes of biomass will be generated through forest restoration efforts. Three weeks ago, I witnessed a demonstration of biomass utilization in the midst of , acres of insect-infested pine on the Umpqua National Forest. BioChar Products of Halfway, Oregon, converted a bone dry ton of biomass into gallons of bio-oil--while producing pounds of Bio-char, which is a rich growth medium. By means of this technology, my county could produce million gallons of bio-oil and million pounds of Bio-char every year for at least years, and probably in perpetuity from the slash and fuels reduction material we now burn. I wish to thank in particular Committee Member Stephanie Herseth Sandlin and Peter DeFazio for their efforts to permit biomass and fuels reduction efforts on Federal forest lands. I would ask you to support definitions for renewable biomass, such as found in the Baucus-Tester discussion draft and the Farm Bill. Forest restoration is a complex and controversial topic that should be further discussed. I would be delighted to participate in other hearings regarding that subject. Much of the efforts described here have had their genesis in Title II and III projects funded through the Secure Rural Schools Act, which also provides vitally needed support for , school districts and counties nationwide. I ask for your continued support of Secure Rural Schools legislation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and the Committee, for permitting me the honor of appearing before the House Subcommittee for National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands. [The prepared statement of Mr. Laurance follows:] Statement of Joseph Laurance, Douglas County Commissioner, Douglas County, Oregon Federal fiscal savings realized from this effort could contribute to offsets required for ``Secure Rural Schools'' funding, so vital to the educational and service needs of over counties and school districts nationwide. At a meeting of Oregon county commissioners last summer, I complained to my colleagues that while endless debate continued in congress about how federal forests should be managed, fires were ravaging federal timberlands in my county and throughout the western United States. The worldwide financial crisis that was draining the national treasury made re-authorization of ``Secure Rural Schools'' funding seem doubtful, threatening many of Oregon's counties with social and economic ruin. Bad news just kept coming with the word that unemployment in Douglas County had reached . % and if unreported joblessness was considered, was probably greater than the % experienced here during the height of the ``Great Depression''. Talks were ongoing in Copenhagen about greenhouse gas emissions while the three fires in my county burned toward an eventual total of , acres, equal to the greenhouse gasses emitted by one million cars in a year's time. My fellow commissioners suggested that I craft a solution to the problems you of this body are all too familiar with. The resultant resolution has been carefully considered by commissioners from across the western United States who helped in its preparation. It has been unanimously adopted by the Association of Oregon Counties, Western Interstate Region of Counties, and the National Association of Counties (NACo) Public Lands Committee and is expected to be adopted by NACo at its annual national conference next week. Twenty years and twenty days ago the Northern Spotted Owl was listed as threatened under the federal ``Endangered Species Act''. It was then thought that loss of old growth habitat through logging was the culprit causing a declining population. In response, federal timber harvests were vastly curtailed. The Umpqua National Forest in my county saw an annual harvest of million board feet in reduced to million board feet in . In the years since a policy of ``benevolent neglect'' of federal lands has seen Spotted Owl numbers continue to decline through habitat destruction caused by increasingly numerous and intense forest fires and through predation by the Barred Owl which favors this new ``unmanaged'' forest habitat. Federal policy, which had been multiple use of the forest with an emphasis on industrial harvest, sought a new strategy which has yet to be formulated in all these intervening years. The resolution presented you provides that needed new strategy, not only for Oregon but for all of our nation's federal forests from Appalachia to Alaska. Federal forest managers would now have a clearly defined desired forest condition that must be obtained within a specified time. If this becomes the ``Intent of Congress'', the Forest Service and BLM would join with private industry to restore forest health and rural economies without drawing on the national treasury. The various Fire Regime Condition Classes described within the resolution indicate the extent of departure from the natural, historic conditions prior to fire exclusion or suppression. Typically, this departure occurred as native peoples were progressively displaced by European Americans during the westward expansion. Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) is similar to the forest which European explorers first found here. That forest had been modified by fire for more than thousand years to provide the native inhabitants with what were then life's necessities. These included abundant wild game from the most productive and diverse wildlife habitat ever known on this continent. Similarly, the regular burning of competing vegetation permitted propagation of nut bearing trees and other food producing plants. Additionally, the historic ``Healthy Forest'' promoted pristine rivers, streams, and lakes that provided an abundant harvest of fish and waterfowl. Within FRCC the risk of losing key ecosystem components to fire is low, while vegetation species composition, structure, and pattern are intact and functioning within the natural historic range. FRCC is a moderate departure from natural, historic conditions described above, with a moderate risk of losing key ecosystem components. Fire frequency, intensity, and size are increased with moderate increases in density, encroachment of shade tolerant tree species, or moderate loss of shade intolerant tree species. FRCC is the highest possible risk of catastrophic fire with dramatic changes to fire size, intensity, severity, and landscape patterns. High increases in density are typically associated with high mortality as a result of disease or insect infestation. These areas typically need high levels of restoration through hand or mechanical treatments. For purposes of this discussion, the full range of treatments available for active landscape scale management would be employed including fuels reduction, thinning of selected stands, and harvest where needed. These treatments must be successfully implemented before prescriptive fire can be used to maintain optimum forest conditions. Of a total national forest system of million acres, information provided by the Forest Service and derived from the `LANDFIRE Project'' list an FRCC total of , , acres nationwide. FRCC is said to be , , acres; FRCC is listed at , , acres. Other information regarding Fire Classes is drawn from a report of the Inspector General of the USDA which lists FRCC at , , acres while other sources suggest FRCC at , , acres and FRCC at , , acres. The total acreage of fuels reduction on the national forest by means of mechanical treatment to for (the last available figures) totaled . million acres. Treatment required based on the figures above for the defined time period would amount to between million and . million acres for reduction of FRCC to FRCC during the first year period and between . and . million acres for a reduction from FRCC to FRCC during the second years. More specific information regarding the work required and the costs associated will be forthcoming this August from a Title III study of , acres of Forest Service lands in my county which will identify, with scientific precision, the characteristics of that ``anthropogenic'' forest in the year , immediately prior to the European American presence. These characteristics will closely approximate the natural, historic conditions described in FRCC in a forest where all three classes now exist. The study referred to is titled Upper Pre-Contact Reference Condition Study and is revealing a mosaic forest, heavily populated by people, who actively managed and maintained their travel ways, their camp sites, and their hunting and gathering grounds. These areas tended to be more open with fewer and larger trees together with a wide diversity of species. The forest we are finding on those sites today are more dense with the majority of the trees less than years old and far fewer of the oaks and pines, although we find a profusion of relics of their existence. The study area would seem to be an excellent candidate as a pilot project to provide specific information related to healthy forest restoration as envisioned by the resolution described earlier. One example of a locally grown effort at forest restoration while creating rural jobs is Communities for Healthy Forests, Inc. CHF is a non profit organized in after devastating fires in Oregon galvanized Douglas County, Oregon community leaders into action. While attorneys, judges and elected officials deliberated upon what course of action to take on the millions of acres burned forest, the health of our rural communities and the health of the forests surrounding them were ignored. The decision to debate environmental policy in the face of an emergency becomes a decision to limit any restorative action. Economic opportunities of removing dead material to fund replanting and other restoration activities are lost as are the multitude of jobs these activities could support. The fire-killed material left on site becomes fuel for the next fire, and carbon to be emitted into the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, actively restoring these insect and fire damaged forests can put local people to work. Putting people to work to restore overgrown forests can reduce the fire hazard; sustain healthy growing forest conditions resistant to catastrophic fire and insect attack. As scientists like Dr. Thomas Bonnicksen and many others tell us, these were the conditions our forests contained for thousands of years due to the influence of Native Americans, conditions and people which were sustained for thousands of years. This active management is widely supported as shown by polls conducted by Communities for Healthy Forests as well as The Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The vast majority of Oregonians agree that we must act if we are to sustain our beautiful forests, our rural economy and the communities which are capable of sustaining them. Similar projects have been undertaken by The Douglas Forest Protective Association who has provided job skills training for youth since . Among their number is our current County Sheriff. Tasks being completed by area youth include fire training and fuels reduction projects. These youth will also be in the fire line in a few days time. The Oregon Youth Conservation Corp has provided similar opportunities for an average of youth per year for the past decade. Our local Phoenix School has done the same for area youth this most recent school year with expected to participate next year. The resolution anticipates that significant volumes of biomass will be generated through forest restoration efforts. Three weeks ago I witnessed a demonstration of Biomass utilization in the midst of , acres of an insect infested pine forest. BioChar Products of Halfway, Oregon converted a bone dry ton of biomass into gallons of Bio-oil while producing lbs. of Bio-char, a rich growth medium. By means of this technology, my county could produce million gallons of Bio-oil and million pounds of Bio-char every year for at least years and probably in perpetuity. I wish to thank in particular Committee members Stephanie Herseth Sandlin and Peter DeFazio for their efforts to permit biomass and fuels reduction efforts on federal forest lands. Forest Restoration is a complex and controversial topic that should be further discussed. I would be delighted to participate in other oversight hearings regarding that subject. Much of the efforts described here have had their genesis in Title II and III projects funded through the Secure Rural Schools Act, which also provides vitally needed support for school districts and counties nationwide. Thank you for permitting me the honor of appearing before the House Subcommittee for National Parks, Forests and Public Lands. ______ A NACo Resolution to Promote Healthy Forest Ecosystems and Reduce the Release of Green House Gases through Active Management of the Nation's Forests. Issue: Each year catastrophic wildfires throughout the nation contribute to global warming, jeopardize the national treasury, threaten fish and wildlife habitat, degrade both water and air quality, and cause devastation to forest dependent communities through loss of life, property, jobs, and the nation's timber resource. Federal Forests should be actively managed to reduce the threat of wildfire and the release of greenhouse gases. Restoration and conservation of our National Forest will insure a sustainable economic and environmental legacy for future generations. Proposed Policy: NACo urges Congress to enact legislation to direct and enable federal forest management agencies to reduce Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC ) to the standard of FRCC in all federal forests by the year , and to reduce FRCC to the standard of FRCC in all federal forests by the year , through the means of active landscape scale management, fuels reduction, and immediate post-fire restoration. Background: Some million acres or % of the nation's federal forests are at ``a high risk of ecologically destructive wild land fire'' according to a report of the Inspector General of the USDA. An average of million acres of forest has burned each year for the past years in the US, primarily on federal lands. An estimated . Million Metric Tons of greenhouse gasses were released last year in the US through forest fire. An Executive Order of Oct. , directs federal agencies to ``consider and account for. . .emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from Federal land management practices''. With this resolution, NACo joins the White House in an effort to reduce greenhouse gasses caused by forest fires on federal lands. Fiscal Urban/Rural Impact: The cost to taxpayers to fight these fires exceeds $ Billion each year. The value of the timber thus consumed costs taxpayers $ . Billion every year. If Congress enacts this legislation, then directs federal land management agencies to implement the resultant policy, thousands of communities throughout the nation would experience significant social and economic recovery with the creation and return of forest based employment as well as the many other benefits of multi- use forest management. Urban areas would benefit from reduced taxation which now serves to support neighboring distressed rural communities. The nation would benefit from reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased carbon sequestration and storage, improved fish and wildlife habitat, enhanced air and water quality, greater quantities of biomass based energy and forest products derived from federal lands serving to increase the national treasury, and an ultimate reduction in the cost of federal land management, half of which is devoted to fire suppression each year. ______ Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Commissioner. Let me begin with Deputy Secretary Vasquez first of all. Mr. Vasquez, let me welcome you to the Subcommittee. I think this is the first time Rural Development has been before the Subcommittee, so welcome. And if you could just give the Committee a little background on how Rural Development and the Forest Service came to start this new partnership under this Administration. Mr. Vasquez. The beginning of this really came out of some internal policy discussions. The Secretary had given us a major charge to begin to look at regional innovation across rural America, and charged all the mission areas to begin to have discussions about how we collaborate to implement that. So we had some initial discussions with the Forest Service about some of the issues that they were facing in Alaska, and we took a trip to southeast Alaska and had two major regional meetings, and met with various nonprofit organizations and advocate organizations and operators, and had pretty much a half day or longer session getting the information and input. The realization of that meeting was that there was truly some positive and I think constructive information that was gleaned from that, and in a sense that innovation could come from the region, from the population and the organizations from the bottom up. We went back to Washington, had a sense of the things that came up in that group, and decided to go out and do focus groups in the communities surrounding the Tongass Forest. From that, we gained even more information and realization that there are communities thinking about woody biomass. They are thinking about alternative energy. They are thinking about aquaculture. All kinds of things came out of these focus groups; specific projects that came out, a lot of what I would consider low-hanging fruit and projects that we felt that we could respond to. But what came out of this that resonated was that there was a need to begin to look at a more comprehensive regional and economic approach to the response of not just the Tongass, but economic activity within the region because we found that there was a diversified economy that we needed to pay more attention to and look at how we could strategically invest, and look at how we use the natural resource base as a means to advance the region in a more diverse way. So from that, we have kept meeting, and currently now we are meeting with not just the Forest Service, but I meet biweekly with all of the Deputy Under Secretaries from across the entire missionaries of the entire Department to begin to look at how we work with each other across all mission areas. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you very much. Mr. Jensen, I am also interested in the expanded use of the stewardship contracting. We have been told repeatedly, though, however, that there are major barriers, such as the cancellation ceiling. What options are you considering to deal with this problem, either administratively or legislatively. Mr. Jensen. Thank you for bringing this up. Obviously, you heard it is a key part of our testimony here today. Stewardship contracting is core to getting the jobs and getting the work done that we need to do in the Forest Service. I think the county commissioner at the end of the table here very clearly painted a picture about what is at stake--that our lands are not in the best of condition in a lot of places. Stewardship contracting, as you are highlighting here, is the key to solving that. We are running into some problems, and we are finding ways to address some of these administratively, looking at new ways to restructure some contracts. But there is also a challenge with this cancellation ceiling you just noted, which basically requires money to be put on the front end of contracts to ensure and guarantee that those that are investing in any of the resources that are part of this long-term contract, if we need to break that, there is money to pay them for those investments. That tends to be a little bit of a hurdle for us in terms of trying to come up with the type of money needed to guarantee that contract. So we are looking at various options. We haven't been able to firm up on an exact solution, but there are different ways to perhaps look at different ways to commit that money on the front side, or perhaps when the actual change in the contract occurs, and we would be happy to work closer with you to figure out what that might look like. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. My time is up. Mr. Bishop. Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate the panel, both panels who will be here. The fact that you all were sitting for so long, I apologize. It is part of the horrible time-management plan we have in Congress, and one of the systemic changes that need to take place. In like manner to the second panel, because I was expecting you to be done by now. I won't be here either. So I apologize for leaving you. It is not that I am offended by any of you, yet. It is just that I am--I apologize. It is the way we manage things around here. And I also apologize for missing the first two presentations. I did want to hear those because I have not had the opportunity of reading the supplied written testimony. I will get to that. I do have a couple of questions for you, although based on what we have heard in the past--Mr. Jensen, let me start with you, and I will try and go through this as quickly as we can. From the very few internal documents that have been turned over by the Department of the Interior related to the so-called brainstorming sessions you had on coming up with land management plans that included new national monuments, your name has appeared on several of those e-mails and agenda items. Can you tell us what specific proposals regarding the Forest Service were in the treasured landscape documents? Mr. Jensen. The Forest Service is not involved in any conversations around designating land monuments on Federal lands. There had been early discussions around America's Great Outdoors, and I don't know if the different terminologies are getting mixed up in between, but the Department of Agriculture is not involved in any of that. Mr. Bishop. But you were part of those brainstorming sessions, or not? Mr. Jensen. No, I was not. Mr. Bishop. OK. If indeed some of the Forest Land was carved out to those monuments, is there any way that you could ensure that existing multiple use would not be implemented or impacted by it? Because obviously the documents we have seen so far, the term multiple use has never been used. Mr. Jensen. It is hard to guess what might be in something that is not something that is real right now. So I can tell you that the Forest Service very much believes in the multiple use mandate and mission, and we would be looking toward that in any sort of decisions that move forward. Mr. Bishop. Thank you. You need to go back and make sure where your name shows up. It would be helpful to you. Mr. Jensen. OK. Mr. Bishop. If I could ask Ms. Sobeck--I hope I didn't mispronounce that--from Fish and Wildlife Services. Your agency is directly involved in reintroducing wolves in many areas of the West, including New Mexico. Ranchers are complaining about the impact of the wolf pack on their herds. Kids in Catron County are being stalked as they are now going to school, and there is a growing sense that Fish and Wildlife Service is disregarding public safety and welfare by that management practice. Has the Fish and Wildlife Service studied the economic impact of your wolf management program in New Mexico or anywhere else? Ms. Sobeck. I do not know the answer to that, but I would be happy to get to you, especially with respect to the New Mexico plan. I do know that we are very concerned about wolves and public safety, and the Endangered Species Act does have provisions to make sure that human life is protected. Mr. Bishop. If you would get back to me on the specifics of that, I would be very grateful. Ms. Sobeck. Yes. We would be happy to do that. Mr. Bishop. We will put it on the list of documents we are waiting to see. Just philosophically, should the management activities be changed if you find a detrimental impact on the local economy? Ms. Sobeck. The determination about whether or not to list a species is--the criteria are set out in the statute, and the economics of the impact on local communities is not one of the criteria for listing, but it is one of the criteria for-- economic impact is one of the criteria for designation of critical habitat, if any. Mr. Bishop. So is that it ought to be and is not, or it should be, or it is? Ms. Sobeck. I think economics should be a factor at appropriate points within the framework of the Endangered Species Act and its regulations. Mr. Bishop. Mr. Laurence, I have only got seconds to ask the commissioner. I apologize for that. You gave a good recommendation as to what has happened to the Spotted Owl in reality. Economically, what has happened to Douglas County since that was listed as an endangered species? Mr. Laurance. We went from one of the more comfortable governments in the State of Oregon--the timber economy, which has been the economy of my county, is a -percent remnant, and that largely because private lands have stepped into the gap. In the documentation that I brought with me, you will see that we are cutting percent. In the year , we cut million board feet off of the Umpqua National Forest. By , that had dropped to million, again percent. It has come up a little bit, but again, we are a percent remnant, and we have all of the associated social pain that you can imagine. Mr. Bishop. I appreciate that. Thank you. Maybe you can share that document with Fish and Wildlife. It would help you in implementing the local economy into your deliberations at some time. Mr. Laurance. Thank you. Mr. Bishop. Mr. Chairman, again I apologize, and to the second panel. I am not trying to be rude by leaving, but Mr. Grijalva is happy I am. But to the second panel, I am not trying to be rude by leaving, but I am, and I do apologize to you. Mr. Grijalva. See you later. Mr. Lujan. Mr. Lujan. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. A couple of questions, Mr. Chairman. First I will start with Deputy Under Secretary of Rural Development, Mr. Vasquez. As you know, communities in New Mexico take a great deal of pride in the uniqueness of our culture and our traditions. Many of our farmers and ranchers depend on our distinctive irrigation systems known as acequias to the land grants that were granted over years ago. And I want to emphasize that, over years ago. Can you go into additional details regarding your Department's efforts to reach out to unique regional systems to better support them? And they should be included in consultation when they are in areas that may be impacted. Mr. Vasquez. I can tell you from the rural development perspective and what I mentioned in our testimony, is that first and foremost, we take the perspective of local residents and local, I guess, strategies and innovation, of the utmost importance. So, yes, we would welcome the opportunity to consult with groups on how to respond to the uniqueness of what is used in agriculture in those areas. It may be that we would end up partnering with other mission areas, but we can start with rural development to look at what it is that needs to be responded to and how we could go about framing it. Mr. Lujan. I appreciate that very much, Mr. Under Secretary, as we look to grants that may be able to be accessed, but also accessed when there is designation, especially with some of our forest lands. That is something I am very interested in. Deputy Under Secretary, Mr. Jensen, thank you for appearing before the Subcommittee again as well. As you know, many rural communities have limited access to the Internet. I am particularly interested in what you are doing to help increase that collaboration and what we can do to see continued access, especially in rural communities, from economic purposes. Mr. Jensen. And you said to the Internet? I might defer to my counterpart here, Secretary Vasquez, as Rural Development has some pretty fascinating things going on around broadband. Mr. Vasquez. We are looking. We are going through round two of reviewing proposals for broadband expansion, and to date, it has been pretty much covered in most of the states. But if there are areas that we need to pay particular attention to through our Rural Utility Service, we would be more than happy to meet with those communities to look at how we can provide technical assistance to move in that direction. Mr. Lujan. I appreciate that very much. And then also looking at Rural Utility Service to see how we can strengthen it, as opposed to programs that may be proposed for reductions. These are important programs to rural America, who wouldn't have power--we wouldn't have telecommunications if it weren't for it, and so we need to strengthen those programs. Deputy Assistant Secretary Sobeck, what are you doing to protect hunting and fishing activities across the country, especially in New Mexico? How can we work closer with our state officials to plan, maintain, and protect access to hunting and fishing? Ms. Sobeck. Congressman Lujan, we consider the hunting and fishing community to be essential partners to the Fish and Wildlife Service on our refuge lands, and with respect to the migratory bird resources that we manage. So we have multiple partnerships with the hunting and fishing community. We consider them essential partners and work with them on a regular basis, inventing many, many of our programs. And we look to them for ideas and inspiration about how to increase access to hunting and fishing opportunities, both on Federal lands and private lands. We know that protection of vital habitat has been attributable in large part to the support of the hunting and fishing community, and we need to make sure--I heard this this week in Nebraska--that there is a new generation of hunters that value their access to the land and their relationship to resources. And I think that those opportunities and the conservation and recreational goals of our agency are very closely aligned. So I don't have any specific examples with respect to New Mexico, but I know that we have had some America Great Outdoors listening sessions. They are planned to be held in your state, and we will be looking for any suggestions. We are truly listening to the local groups and want to hear their ideas about how to accomplish the goals that you described. And so I think that we have very closely aligned interests in that area. Mr. Lujan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And as we look to continue this discussion, again the city of Santa Fe will be celebrating its th anniversary this year, land grants that date back years, traditional access and uses, whether it was gathering wood or woods with Pinon or some of our small producers that have used the land for grazing as well, hunting and fishing, proud traditions back home that I know that, Mr. Chairman, we will be able to make sure we are addressing and looking to improve the economic activity around the country. Thank you. Mr. Grijalva. If I may, Mr. Lujan, the -year anniversary of Santa Fe---- Mr. Lujan. Four hundred. Mr. Grijalva. Four hundred? In comparison to Plymouth Rock, more or less. Mr. Lujan. Mr. Chairman, they are celebrating the th anniversary in the city, and I am not sure where we are with Plymouth Rock, but I can guarantee you it is not . Mr. Grijalva. Mr. DeFazio. Mr. DeFazio. I honor the City of Santa Fe, but I think it actually is past Plymouth Rock. I think that was , but maybe I am wrong. So anyway, to the subject at hand. First, to the Department of Agriculture; either one of you can answer this. You know, I was involved with a coalition, and we had some quite lengthy discussion and struggle with Chairman Waxman to include in the so-called cap and trade bill, which I did not support, language for biomass utilization on Federal lands, and making it eligible for the same tax credits that you can get off private lands. And as I understand, the Administration supported that initiative. But now, we have the Environmental Protection Agency proposing to reclassify the utilization of biomass in defiance of all their past positions in terms of the carbon cycle, and to in fact essentially potentially classify it the same as fossil fuels, coal. And I am just wondering, since you both talk about woody biomass utilization and some examples and how productive this could be--and certainly Commissioner Laurance makes a great case and brought a pilot project to the Umpqua National Forest there--are you concerned, have you engaged with, are you tracking the EPA? Does the left hand of the Administration know what the right hand is doing here? Mr. Jensen. The left hand the right hand are firmly shaking and trying to figure out how to get that handshake to get on the same page. The Department of Agriculture--this issue you raise is absolutely essential that we figure out how to create the kinds of good, positive, sustainable incentives to use, in this case, woody biomass, if we are dealing with the Forest Service. So this question, I think, in particular around how you define renewable biomass is a really key one. There is a public lands component to it. There is a private lands component to it. It revolves a lot around the sustainability of that resource. The Secretary has testified that the Farm Bill definition is an appropriate and comprehensive place to look at how to approach that issue. Mr. DeFazio. As I understand from some discussion with some of the environmental groups, they have two concerns. One is scale, and the other is--there are some delusional environmentalists who believe that after we do all of the fuel reduction, which most people would agree is necessary so we don't torch up our green forests with fuel conditions that never should have existed, that have been poorly managed--some think that, well, after you finish that, you will then install capacity, and you will go back, and you will cut down the big old trees. I said, so we are going to cut down a $ , Douglas fir or $ , old growth ponderosa, and turn it into $ worth of wood chips. I am not certain how to deal with that. But I think in terms of the scaling and the sustainability, you could deal with it through stewardship contracts and prescriptions over the land base. And the other thing I would observe is that you don't have the budget to do the fuel reduction. I mean, GAO says we are losing ground. Actually, we are becoming more and more fire prone every year because of accumulating dried fuels and woody biomass that shouldn't be there, and it is going to burn catastrophically in most places. So this, I think--and I don't know if you have any studies on this, but I believe that if you entered into larger scale contracts, say to feed a project of appropriate scale, to reduce woody biomass, you probably would get a cheaper bid price on that work. I would assume you could stretch your dollars further. Don't you think that is so, if there were some product to come out of there, as opposed to piling it up into slash piles and burning it next winter? Mr. Jensen. There are economies of scale, and that is very much one of the key beliefs and thoughts that we have got in trying to get more work done, create those economies of scale so we can get more done with fewer dollars. Mr. DeFazio. OK. Well, I am glad to see we are on the same page there, and I would do anything I can to help you with that. I organized a letter of about Members of Congress expressing concern with this potential reclassification or new classification to the EPA administrator, and we expect to be meeting with her to discuss that. The other issue you raised, which is also critical, is you talk about the Secure Rural Schools and the fact that it has provided beneficial projects across the West. And I guess what I would like to know is I am sending a letter just now to the President signed by--I am trying to remember how many, how many people in our letter; , another Members of Congress-- regarding the long-term prospects for Secure Rural Schools and the projects you discussed here, the resource advisory committees and those projects. And I am wondering--I discussed this with the President earlier this year. He referred letters both to the Secretary of Agriculture, since that is Forest Service, and the Secretary of the Interior, and said that they should follow up with me on my concerns about some longer-term plan. And I haven't heard anything yet. Mr. Jensen. I am glad you are beginning the discussion because reauthorization of that bill is up in , and it has been a very important tool and lifeblood for these rural communities and counties that are surrounded a lot of times by public lands. So we have seen tremendous success. The types of projects that come out of that bill have led toward some of the best work that is out there that is not appealed, that is not litigated. And so we are looking forward to engaging that conversation. We are very glad that you are bringing it up, and look forward to continuing that. Mr. DeFazio. I would change the tense, not bringing. I have been persistently--I brought up with the President as a candidate, then brought it up--but, most recently, personally brought it up with him a few months ago. And I would hope to get some response to the referred letter by the President. As he said, he would ask both secretaries to engage on that issue. I want to, Mr. Chairman, if I could, just apologize to the next panel because I have a lunch with the Majority Leader at noon to discuss manufacturing jobs. Rural jobs are very important. Manufacturing jobs are important, too. I am a bit conflicted, and there is a member of the next panel who I think has much to tell us about that, and I will try and get back. But I just want to apologize in advance. Mr. Grijalva. Let me follow up with a couple of questions. And if I can invite Dan Wenk up for a question, and also Mr. Poole from BLM up for a question, I would appreciate that. Thank you very much. Mr. Wenk, we have heard assertions constantly that national parks negatively impact rural communities, yet we also hear how important parks are to businesses and economic activity, particularly in gateway communities. Can you give us some hard numbers on what effect a Grand Canyon, a Zion, a Yellowstone have to the surrounding areas? And if you would, please, if you don't mind, identify yourself for the record. Mr. Wenk. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I can. I am Dan Wenk, the Deputy Director of the National Park Service. The Deputy Assistant Secretary Sobeck talked about the national impact in terms of dollars and jobs of the national parks across the country. But if I could add to that, if I just took one area of the country, which would be the inter-mountain region, visitors spent more than $ . billion in the gateway communities surrounding the parks. There are parks across eight states in the inter-mountain region. More than $ . billion, which supported more than , local jobs and contributed approximately $ . billion in added value. That is the net value added to the region's economy in the preferred measure of how an industry or an activity contributes to the economy. Specific examples to your question. Visitor spending in National Park Service payroll in the Grand Canyon supported more than , jobs and contributed approximately $ million in value added. Rocky Mountain National Park supported almost , local jobs and contributed over $ million. Yellowstone supported almost , jobs, and contributed approximately $ million in value added. Glacier supported more than , jobs and contributed approximately $ million in added value. Just a couple more facts of note. In the State of Arizona, visitor spending accounted in payroll accounted for $ million and about , jobs. In Utah, $ million and , jobs. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. And now, Mr. Poole, we have also heard--and thank you, and if you could identify yourself for the record as well. But we have heard a lot recently about the loss of energy jobs in Utah specifically. But according to your testimony, the Milford wind corridor project has created jobs in the area and brought more than $ million in economic benefit. So it looks like you are working with the private sector to create jobs. And can you talk about this and other opportunities that you can tell the Committee about? Mr. Poole. Yes, I can, Mr. Chairman. That is the Milford Project in Utah. It is divided in two phases. BLM authorized phase one in . At that time, we authorized approximately wind turbines, producing about megawatts. We are in the process of authorizing phase two for an additional wind turbines and an additional megawatts. Those figures are correct. Our estimates is it has resulted in about jobs, about $ million in revenue to the State of Utah. And the overall investment being made by the company is about $ million. Currently, we have what we call fast track projects, projects bureau-wide. This includes many aspects of our renewable portfolio. That is solar, that is wind, that is geothermal. That is also either upgrade or to new transmission, all of which will be producing jobs and additional revenue, for the most part in proximity to rural communities throughout the West. Mr. Grijalva. One quick question for the commissioner. I was particularly interested, and these partnerships are, I think, important, and particularly in our part of the country. But I was interested in how your project has worked out the partnerships with the local tribes. I think that is not only interesting, but very important. Mr. Laurance. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Shortly after I took office in , I was talking to Senator Wyden, and we talked about these issues--about how there is dissension--and he said if I could bring together a local collaborative group to discuss these issues and seek solutions, it made his job as legislator an easier job. In recognizing that, I looked at about influential members of my community on all sides, environmental advocates, timber industry, government, Federal land managers, and vetted through that -name list, and came up with about names who spoke with authority for those organizations they represented, but were careful listeners as well. And the result of those conversations over the course of three years has developed the resolution that you see before you. It is interesting that among the people who first talked to me, for instance, about pre-European conditions that we talk about, the first with me is Javier Goirigolzarri, a forestry consultant. Speaking with me about this very thing was Paul Beck, a timber manager for a local timber company; as well as Ken Carlon, a professor at our local college, and also the president of probably the most influential environmental organization in my county; as well as Steven Rondo, resource manager of the Umpqua--the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Indian Tribe. And it is interesting that in conversations, it was always directed toward the tribe. And we wanted their buy-in. And they helped shape a vision that harkens back - years in their oral tradition. And it is interesting that this has become vitally important to them. We are identifying heritage sites, many of which remain sacred and only known, as we discover them, to that tribe in this study. And interesting aside is that my son, who is working for the Forest Service, who has had a lifelong interest in native plants, has a variety of every plant used by the local Indian tribe in prehistory growing somewhere on my place--some of them look like weeds, but he promises me they are not. So that collaboration is very rich, and I think beneficial to my entire community. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. Mr. Jensen, Ms. Sobeck, I have other questions that I will submit in writing to you. And I appreciate your response to the Committee. Mr. Jensen, I won't ask you about meetings or anything like that. If you do have an independent thought on your own, please keep it to yourself. Anyway, thank you very much, and I invite the next panel up. Mr. Jensen. Thank you. [Pause] Mr. Grijalva. Thank you very much. Let me welcome the panel and turn to my colleagues that have joined us today for introductions of individuals on the panel. Let me begin with Mr. Lujan, sir. Mr. Lujan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Today, Mr. Chairman, I am proud to introduce two panelists, one on the second panel, which we have before us today, and one that will be speaking on the third panel. Mr. Lee, thank you for appearing before the Subcommittee today. This is an important topic to many folks back home in New Mexico, and especially to the Committee. I worked closely with the Cattle Growers' Association in the past, and I am familiar with the important concerns, and many opinions shared by our stockmen. I believe like you that in the creation of Federal land, local communities' concerns should be kept in mind. I was proud that while developing language for my Rio Grande del Norte National Conservation Area Establishment Act, I met and spoke with members of the Cattle Growers' Association and the New Mexico stockmen to ensure their concerns were listened to so that access for traditional uses was protected. Preservation of land must take into consideration our way of life. Everyone can work together, but that means ideas have to be shared, and respectful discussion must play a big part. To that end, I believe that we agree in protecting the land, while approaches may differ on the best methods of preserving our culture, traditional uses, and access, I believe that it is important for the Subcommittee to hear the unique concerns of our community in New Mexico, and how we can work together as we protect traditional uses for our farmers, ranchers, acequias, and land grants, and manage our public lands. Once again, thank you for joining me today, Mr. Lee. And, Mr. Chairman, if I may, with the introduction of our second guests that we will have on the next panel, I have the pleasure of introducing a constituent from Taos, New Mexico, Ms. Rachael Mondragon, the founder of Urban Interface Solutions. Ms. Mondragon has worked closely with state and Federal lands for much of the past decade, in both the Carson National Forest and the Cimarron State Forestry Office. Ms. Mondragon has dedicated herself to protecting our rural communities through wildfire suppression field work, and front office respectively. Her skill in the Carson National Forest suppression crew enabled her to continue wildfire prevention and continue with her fire department as a crew boss. Building upon her knowledge of forest and work experiences, Ms. Mondragon developed Urban Interface Solutions, a diverse company that tackles such projects as landscape scaling and hazardous fuels reduction planning and implementation efforts. These experiences have equipped Ms. Mondragon with a unique perspective or protecting our wildlife while creating business and industry locally. Through her hard work, dedication, independent business spirit, and endurance, Urban Interface Solutions is a successful company that was granted $ , to work cooperatively with the Taos Pines Ranch through the collaborative forest restoration program. Her work with Federal agencies and grants through these are additional evidence of the benefits of joint work between private industry and Federally protected land, and how they can work together for the betterment of our communities. Thank you for joining us today, Ms. Mondragon and Mr. Lee. I look forward to the testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, sir. Now also let me ask unanimous consent for Mr. Minnick to join us at the dais, if he so chooses after his introduction. If there is no objection, so ordered; and also extend to him the opportunity to introduce one of your constituents, sir. Mr. Minnick. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am here to acknowledge an Idahoan who is going to testify in your next panel, Kristin Troy of Salmon, Idaho. She is the Executive Director of the Lemhi Regional Land Trust, and you will be hearing from her shortly, and also to introduce Joyce Dearstyne. Joyce is on this panel, second from my left. She is the Executive Director of Framing Our Community. This is a small business incubator and value-added job skills and training organization that is unique because of its location. Joyce started this organization and runs it in Elk City, Idaho, which has to be one of the most remote cities--it is a town of a little over , people--in the lower . The city is perched very near rim of the main Salmon River overlooking the second deepest canyon in North America. There is some dispute, Mr. Chairman, over whether the deepest is in your state or my state, but this is second in any event. And it is surrounded by the largest wilderness area on three sides, the largest wilderness area in the lower . It is a center of productive forest land that is managed by the Forest Service on a multiple uses basis. Elk City was a typical mill town, had a single employer, and the mill closed in . The city was very fortunate to have Joyce there and Framing Our Community, her organization, which stepped in, and has kept that town on the map. It has done it by her ingenuity using a very limited amount of Federal dollars, by becoming a small business incubator that has drawn in a number of forest-based conversion options. They produce specialty lumber. They produce wood fiber for a cogeneration operation that Joyce is in the process of starting, and a whole bevy of training organizations that promote healthy forestry. She has started training programs which deal with watershed restoration, which is a key to stewardship sales in this very rugged back country area; natural disaster response; and even a program called Artists in the Woods. And it is truly remarkable. She has turned this community, instead of drying up and blowing away, into one of the most vibrant back country communities in my state. She has also reached outside her community and is an active participator in the Clearwater Collaborative, which is a group that Senator Crapo of my state has put together to come up with a--bring interest groups together and come up with a cooperative land management plan that hopes to present you a forest management plan, including some new wilderness in Idaho, likely next session, and she is a member of a group that is involving Idaho and Washington, the North Idaho and Eastern Washington Jobs Workforce Development Group that is a partnership that brings in and promotes economic development throughout this rural region. She epitomizes what we need to do as a Federal Government in stimulating the kinds of economic development that will keep our rural and forested areas alive in this country. It is a pleasure for me to welcome Joyce Dearstyne. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Congressman. And let me again welcome the panel. Let me begin with Cassandra Moseley, Director, Institute for a Sustainable Environment, University of Oregon. Doctor. welcome. I look forward to your testimony. STATEMENT OF CASSANDRA MOSELEY, PH.D., DIRECTOR, INSTITUTE FOR A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT, UNIVERSITY OF OREGON Dr. Moseley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. Thank you for letting me be here today. I want to talk about the ways we can create jobs through the restoration and maintenance of our public lands. As the Chairman said, I direct the Institute for Sustainable Environment at the University of Oregon. And today, I want to offer some job creation principles, some promising strategies, and a few key recommendations. I am going to leave the specifics to the panelists with muddy boots. National forests and other public lands are critical to securing clean air, water, biodiversity, and carbon, and yet our public lands face a significant need to recover ecosystem function, reduce fire hazard, prepare for and adapt to climate change. These needs create an economic opportunity for public lands communities. Investments in forest and watershed restoration create jobs, jobs at a rate similar to infrastructure projects such as buildings and roads. In a recent study, we found that in Oregon, forest and watershed restoration creates between and jobs per $ million invested. Forest restoration can also generate woody biomass that can be used for wood products and energy, and this can add additional business and employment opportunities. The central challenge is to translate this economic opportunity into economic reality for public land communities over the long term. During the recession, Federal policy has been appropriately focused on stimulating the economy by creating immediate jobs. However, in many public lands communities, they have longer term underlying economic weaknesses that will not be resolved when the national economy recovers. Moving forward, a focus on job quantity rather than job quality can create economies that fail to support families and their communities, and leave out western rural communities altogether because their population densities make it difficult for them to find enough local workers to take advantage of these sorts of strategies. So what does it take to transform the need for forest and watershed restoration into rural wealth, businesses, and jobs? We need agreement about how these lands are managed, agency capacity to act on these agreements, and businesses and a trained workforce to do the work. Over the past years, communities and their agency partners have developed a number of key strategies to create these conditions. One of the key strategies is collaboration. Since the mid- s, diverse collaboratives of agency and community partners have worked to resolve conflict over Federal land management. By starting small and using demonstrations and field tours monitoring, collaborative groups have built trust to move toward landscape-scale restoration. Second, alongside collaboratives, many western communities have created community-based organizations that have emerged to facilitate these groups, work with agencies to plan and implement projects, and undertake business and workforce development. Third, turning to the land management agencies, stewardship contracting has become a key tool for undertaking public lands restoration and creating a diversity of local benefits. For example, on the Fremont National Forest, a -year stewardship contract is being used to implement broad agreement about forest restoration and keep the local sawmill opening, saving milling and logging jobs. A fourth strategy has been integrated value-added manufacturing and biomass utilization. In these efforts, community groups co-develop and co-locate small diameter wood processing facilities, electrical, and heat generation, and these projects are energy efficient, scaled appropriately to local conditions, and structured to allow communities to capture as much benefit as possible. And finally, we are seeing the emergence of regional economic development strategies and networks. Although community-based approaches to development promised to maximize local benefit in places dominated by public lands, larger scale politics and markets greatly affect the ability of community- based efforts to succeed. And increasingly, local organizations are working across communities to develop markets, capital, and facilities. So how can Congress and the Federal Government accelerate conservation-oriented economic development? Let me offer a few suggestions. First, I would recommend the reauthorization of stewardship contracting. Second, I think we need a grant program to allow the national forests and community partners to foster community business and agency capacity to integrate public lands restoration and rural community development. And finally, the Forest Service needs budget structures that allow them to effectively and efficiently conduct integrated restoration on national forest lands. So thank you again for holding this important hearing. The ecological health of public lands and the economic prosperity of nearby communities are inextricably linked. While there is still a lot of work to be done, Federal agencies and their community partners have been developing strategies to improve the health of both the communities and the lands. I look forward to any questions you have. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Dr. Moseley follows:] Statement of Cassandra Moseley, Ph.D., Ecosystem Workforce Program, Institute for a Sustainable Environment, University of Oregon Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to speak before you today about the ways we can create and retain jobs through the restoration and maintenance of public lands. I want to discuss how well-crafted federal land management, contracting, and economic development policies can support high quality jobs, foster robust small enterprises, and create wealth in rural public lands communities. I direct the Ecosystem Workforce Program in the Institute for a Sustainable Environment at the University of Oregon. Founded in , the Ecosystem Workforce Program seeks to build ecological health, economic vitality, and democratic governance in rural forest communities in the American West. We address these interconnected issues with applied research and policy education related to rural communities and federal forest management. I am a founding participant of the Rural Voices for Conservation Coalition, a group that is focused on finding policy solutions that link the long-term health of the land and well-being of rural communities. Over the past nine years, I have undertaken a number of studies about the rural community benefits of Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) contracting, the working conditions of federal contract forest workers, and the use of stewardship contracting. Today, I am going to discuss: . Historical precedents for the Forest Service role in creating local economic benefit . Opportunities to create jobs in public land communities today . Strategies for creating conservation-oriented economic development . Place-based and regional strategies and examples of what is working . Challenges limiting public land communities' participation in and benefit from the conservation of public lands . Recommended policy changes . Caring for the Land, Serving the People: Historical precedents for the Forest Service role in creating local economic benefit for public land communities When beginning a conversation about how public lands can play a role in creating prosperity in rural communities, one can easily ask whether this should be a focus or obligation of these agencies. It is worth briefly considering the founding of the Forest Service. At the turn of the th century, Teddy Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot, and other Progressives advocated for forest reserves and later the Forest Service as agencies that would conserve timber, water, and rangelands immediately and into the future. As part of this vision, they saw local economic well-being as a fundamental part of national forest management. The first regulations of the National Forest Reserves (the Use Book) laid out ``protecting local residents from unfair competition in the use of forest and range'' as a central purpose of the reserves. Since then, Congress has repeatedly created programs to focus the Forest Service's attention on the creation of local economic benefit from sustainable management of the national forests. In the past years, we have seen the Sustained Yield Forest Management Act of , which authorized the Forest Service to create units where sustained yield timber harvest was to benefit the local community; special salvage timber sale and small business timber sale programs; and obligations under the National Forest Management Act to analyze the economic impact of management. More recently, appropriations associated with the National Fire Plan, Secure Rural Schools, and stewardship contracting all focus the attention of national forests on creating local community economic benefit while managing lands for the long term good of the Nation. For a century of its history, the Forest Service has had to simultaneously address national interests and local benefits; and balance current needs and long-term well being. . Forest and watershed restoration and biomass utilization: Opportunities to create jobs in public land communities today Now more than ever, we understand the key roles that national forests and other public lands play in securing clean air, water, biodiversity, and carbon now and into the future. Federal lands also provide places for recreation, retreat, renewal--critical roles in a nation that struggles to unplug and unwind; and even more significant for today's youth, who are facing an epidemic of obesity. Despite their importance, our national forests and other public lands face a significant and growing need for management to recover ecosystem function, reduce fire hazard, and prepare for and adapt to climate change. These lands and forests need hazardous fuels reduction, improved wildlife and fish habitat, road decommissioning and maintenance, and updated recreation facilities. Although funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) have helped to reduce the backlog, much still needs to be done. The need to actively restore our national forests and grasslands is great, as is the need to create economic opportunity for the businesses and workers in communities who live adjacent to public lands. Investments in forest and watershed restoration create jobs and economic impacts similar to investments in infrastructure projects such as building roads and bridges. In a recent economic impacts study, we found that forest and watershed restoration activities create between . and . jobs per $ million invested in Oregon. The economic multipliers are in the range of . and . . \ \ Employment numbers tend to be higher for labor intensive activities such as hand thinning, tree planting, and site preparation and lower for equipment-intensive jobs such as construction of instream habitat and mechanical thinning, selective logging and the like. However, the equipment-intensive jobs usually created more total economic impact. The majority of the companies we interviewed were quite small--nearly two-thirds had annual revenues less than $ million. \ \ Forest restoration activities such as hazardous fuels reduction and thinning have the potential to generate small diameter trees and other woody biomass that can be used to create wood products and energy. These products are wide ranging and include posts, poles, furniture, animal bedding, landscaping projects, paper, and engineered wood products and energy including heat and electricity. Developing utilization businesses located near the national forests can reduce treatment costs for the federal government and other landowners, as well as create local business and employment opportunities. \ \ . Restoration and biomass utilization: Strategies for creating conservation-oriented economic development As ARRA winds down over the coming year, the central challenge will be to translate the economic opportunity of forest and watershed restoration and the utilization of byproducts into economic reality for rural communities over the long term. During the recession, federal policy has been focused on stimulating the economy by creating immediate jobs. In many ways, this is an appropriate strategy for encouraging recovery and avoiding deflation. However, many public lands communities have longer-term, underlying economic weaknesses that will not be resolved when the national economy recovers. Beyond short-term stimulus, many rural public lands communities need to develop economically. There are several key dimensions of successful conservation-oriented economic development: Wealth creation and retention: The development of local businesses that provide restoration and stewardship services or energy products need to be scaled to meet local market demand and be part of an integrated economy that includes value-added manufacturing and local ownership to ensure that the money generated circulates through the local economy. Diversity and adaptability: In small rural economies, the businesses that can provide a diversity of services and evolve as needs change will be best able to withstand changes in economic or environmental conditions. In natural resource- based economies, seasons, natural disturbance, and commodity markets are constant sources of change. In the face of climate change and the need for renewable energy development, creating integrated, diverse strategies will allow rural communities to withstand change and perhaps even prosper because of it. Robust small businesses: Local ownership and hybrid ownership models that create not only jobs but also local business opportunities can help create local wealth along with jobs. High quality jobs: Focusing on high quality jobs is critical to overall community well being. Job creation efforts that focus on securing a large number of jobs do not always consider whether those jobs will enable workers to support their families. Equally problematic, rural communities often do not have the population available to take advantage of large- number-low-quality-job strategies, so the jobs and the economic benefits will go to outsiders. Strategies that focus on creating high quality, longer duration jobs will better help rural businesses strengthen their efforts to create more sustained positive economic impacts. . Place-based and regional strategies and examples of what is working What does it take to transform the need for forest and watershed restoration into rural wealth, diverse and flexible enterprises, and jobs? Across the West, communities and their agency partners have been working together to foster economic development around forest and watershed restoration and biomass utilization. Over time, a set of strategies are emerging that foster success. These include: Collaboration Community-based organizations Best value and stewardship contracting and contractor development Promotion of quality jobs Integrated value-added manufacturing and biomass utilization Regional strategies and networks Collaboration Since the mid- s, collaboratives that include front line staff from federal agencies, local government officials, local citizens, environmentalists, and industry representatives have emerged in the West to resolve conflict over federal land management, find common ground, and develop and implement projects. By starting small, using demonstrations and field tours, and monitoring project implementation, many collaborative groups have built sufficient trust to move toward landscape-scale restoration. Now, established collaborations are taking on increasingly large and complex projects. Initially, collaboration can be slow to develop. Strengthening and expanding collaboration is an iterative process, where each project builds on the last. But the benefits of collaboration include innovative solutions to complex problems, reduced tensions, and more financial and technical resources to implement a project. These collaborative approaches are critical to the effective and efficient management of our public lands and to restoring social harmony in the communities that have born the brunt of conflict over national forest management. Collaboration has proved itself to be an essential strategy to developing and implementing durable solutions. Community-based organizations Alongside collaborative processes, in many western communities, community-based organizations have emerged to help facilitate collaborative groups, assist the agencies with project planning and implementation, and support business and workforce development for both restoration and value added manufacturing and biomass utilization. Organizations such as such as Wallowa Resources (Enterprise, OR), Lake County Resources Initiative (Lakeview, OR) and the Watershed Research and Training Center (Hayfork, CA) develop partnerships with local entrepreneurs, agencies, and community leaders to strengthen small local business development and to increase the flow of benefits from forest management to local communities and workers. In addition, regional organizations such as Sustainable Northwest are playing a pivotal role in networking these organizations, providing technical and facilitation assistance, and helping entrepreneurs access urban markets. Place-based, regional, and even some national organizations have become essential in achieving conservation and rural development objectives. These are the entities that create neutral forums of diverse stakeholders for the agencies, provide technical assistance to support local community and business efforts, and foster innovation and hope that federal agencies cannot create on their own. Best value and stewardship contracting and contractor development Direct Federal employment, procurement contracts, timber sales, stewardship contracts, and cooperative agreements are the central ways that the Forest Service generates economic activity through land management. Examining ARRA awards in the West based on recipient location (rather than project location) suggests that the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and the Interior have been the lead funders in many of the hardest hit-rural counties in the West. This is despite the relatively small amount of ARRA funding obligated to land management agencies, suggesting that funds from these agencies can and do reach businesses in the rural West. \ \ The ways contracts and agreements are structured impacts whether local contractors can readily compete for them. Best value contracting, in particular, can reward contractors who perform high quality work, have well-trained workers, or use low impact equipment. In addition, for much of the last decade the Forest Service has had the authority to consider local benefit when awarding stewardship and many service contracts. These authorities can help increase awards to local contractors. \ \ In addition, cooperative agreements between land management agencies and community-based organizations, especially in communities with limited contracting capacity, can help increase local benefit. For example, in Hayfork, California, where there are virtually no contractors left, the Watershed Research and Training Center and the Shasta Trinity National Forest have entered into cooperative agreements for restoration projects that employ and train local workers. This approach serves to create local jobs now while building local workforce capacity for the longer term. In addition to best value contracting and cooperative agreements, stewardship contracting has become a very effective tool for undertaking public lands restoration and creating a diversity of local benefits. For example, in Northern California, the BLM and Forest Service have entered into ten-year stewardship agreements with the Trinity Resource Conservation District to collaboratively mange the Weaverville Community Forest. These agreements have turned a conflict into a broadly-supported strategy to reduce fire hazards, while improving recreational opportunities, protecting cultural resources, and sending logs to the local sawmill. On the Fremont National Forest, a -year stewardship contract is being used to implement broad agreement about forest restoration and keep the local sawmill open, saving dozens of milling and logging jobs. In Central Oregon, stewardship contracting has enabled contractors to acquire new equipment and identify new markets for biomass utilization. In Southwest Oregon, the Rogue Siskiyou National Forest has used stewardship agreements to quickly implement ARRA projects and create more than jobs conducting hazardous fuels reduction. Over the last several years, Forest Service Region has invested in training their staff, members of collaborative groups, and contractors in understanding how to use tools like stewardship contracts. These initial steps and leadership from the Regional Office have positioned national forests in Region to take advantage of stewardship contracting authorities. Promotion of quality jobs Poor job quality has been a long-standing problem for labor- intensive workers such as those that work on thinning and tree planting projects. Often Hispanic migrants, these workers are subject to frequent verbal abuse and safety and labor violations. Changing these conditions requires shifting the dynamics in the labor and contracting markets. In recent years, the Forest Service and Department of Labor have come together to collaborate to increase enforcement of labor, safety, and contracting regulations. More recently, Region of the Forest Service has begun to collaborate with state and Federal agencies and worker organizations to pursue more consistent enforcement and create a cultural change within the agency that supports staff in recognizing and acting on labor and safety violations as they would timber theft or abandoned camp fires. Although there is still a long way to go before labor-intensive forest workers will experience consistent changes in their working conditions, these recent steps are promising. Integrated value-added manufacturing and biomass utilization A number of biomass development strategies are emerging, which integrate value-added manufacturing, and electrical and heat generation. These approaches create projects that are energy efficient, scaled appropriately to local forest conditions, and structured to allow public land communities to capture as much benefit as possible. In Wallowa County, for example, a number of business, nonprofit, and county partners are developing an Integrated Biomass Energy Campus. Already, it has created new jobs utilizing woody biomass that otherwise would have been left in the woods after thinning to be piled and burned. With planned additions to the campus, including a new combined heat and power plant that will provide electrical and thermal energy to the co-located companies, total employment will rise to - jobs (nearly % of non-farm workforce in the county) and annual biomass purchase will increase to , tons - value of about $ . to $ . million annually. This project will support additional jobs in the woods and help sustain the economics of private working forestlands. This new local market will help support about , acres of forest restoration/fuel reduction annually. This model reduces transportation costs, creates partnerships, and has the potential to provide sustained community economic development. Regional strategies and networks Although community-based approaches to economic development promise to maximize local benefit, in communities dominated by public lands, the reality is that politics and markets operating regionally and nationally greatly affect the ability of community-based efforts to succeed. Increasingly, community-based organizations are realizing that they need to work across communities and regionally to affect economic development locally. For example, the Ecosystem Workforce Program, Sustainable Northwest, Wallowa Resources, and the Watershed Research and Training Center are collaborating on a regional economic development project focused on sustainable forest stewardship in a dry forest zone covering counties of eastern and southern Oregon and northern California. By strengthening community-based organizations and regional networks, the project will develop a model to increase the viability of sustainable forest stewardship in which rural communities participate and prosper. Our strategy involves: ( ) creating multiple value streams supporting sustainable forest stewardship; ( ) developing integrated biomass utilization and renewable energy; ( ) building community and business capacity to achieve forest and economic resilience; ( ) creating the policy conditions to support sustainable forest stewardship on public and private lands; and ( ) documenting and communicating lessons in the zone, regionally, and nationally. \ \ Grants from the U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities, the USDA Rural Development, and several other sources are funding this project. . Challenges limiting public land communities' participation in and benefit from the conservation of public lands This model of integrated land management and economic development-- collaborative land management planning and implementation, robust community-based organizations and networks, healthy adaptable contracting and wood/biomass processing businesses--is showing promise across the West. But, this model faces considerable policy challenges. For example: Collaborative agreement about how and where to conduct forest and watershed restoration exceeds the financial and organizational capacity to plan and implement projects within the land management agencies, private sector, and nonprofit organizations involved in this work. Local entrepreneurs seeking to develop businesses that use biomass for wood products and energy production face a number of barriers including lack of access to capital, concerns about biomass supply, viable local ownership models, and need for risk sharing. \ \ High-speed Internet connections have become a de facto requirement of contracting with the federal government. However, many rural businesses in the West that wish to work with the government are hampered by lack of broadband. Although the Forest Service's Washington Office and Region Office have provided direction and training for front line personnel to collaborate, and we are seeing increased front line commitment to collaboration, there remain institutional structures--particularly systems of budget formulation and allocation and performance measures--that can create strong disincentives to collaborate. \ \ Federal land management agencies and economic development agencies do not work together consistently. Through the Northwest Economic Adjustment Initiative, the Pacific Northwest developed successful models of sophisticated collaboration among state and federal economic development and natural resource agencies. Unfortunately, these networks have weakened over time due to sustained downsizing and reorganization and a lack of focus. Quality jobs continue to be allusive for many workers performing labor-intensive forest work, and the markets for manual thinning are highly competitive. . Recommendations A. Reauthorize stewardship contracting to allow for continued use of one of the most effective tools available to the Forest Service and BLM for undertaking forest restoration, encouraging business innovation, and creating local benefit. B. Support community-based organizations and collaboration in public lands communities by creating a grant program administered by the national forest system to allow national forests and community partners to foster community, business, and land management agency capacity to collaboratively work to integrate climate change adaptation, public lands restoration, and rural community development. C. Develop Forest Service budget structures that meet today's challenges by allowing for integrated management of national forest system lands. The President's proposed Integrated Restoration and Resource line item moves in the right direction. D. Develop strategies for performance evaluation that reflect the complexity of federal land management and the interconnected goals of ecological health and community well being. Over the past several years, the Forest Service has revamped their performance evaluation system, particularly associated with fire and fuels management. Their performance measures are more sophisticated and their data collection systems are more fully developed. Yet, this target-driven system of performance measurement fails to capture the complexity of the problems facing the agency and fails to credit the agency when they develop and implement innovative solutions to those problems. Moreover, the system, while better at measuring biophysical outputs and outcomes, still lacks measure of socioeconomic outcomes. The recent tracking system created to monitor ARRA jobs and economic impact outcomes could be part of a strategy to incorporate socioeconomic measures into the current accountability system. E. Focus on job quality as a central component of green economic development. We need to focus attention on equal access to worker protection across all types and classes of workers in order to create quality jobs for workers and a level playing field for businesses contractors. This will require sustained attention on the part of Congress, the Federal government, and worker organizations.

I look forward to your testimony. STATEMENT OF JOYCE DEARSTYNE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FRAMING OUR COMMUNITY, INC., ELK CITY, IDAHO Ms. Dearstyne. Good morning, Chairman Grijalva and Committee members. Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to share our efforts in building community sustainability through restoration-based programs that grow value-added businesses. My name is Joyce Dearstyne, and I am the Executive Director of Framing Our Community, a nonprofit organization located in the Clearwater Mountains of north central Idaho. My county is larger than the State of Connecticut. It is percent Federally managed lands, and it depends on the natural resources that surround us for its economic base. Our strength lies in job creation in the woods and in the community. This is accomplished through an integrated program of work and delivered through our Jobs in the Woods and Small Business Incubator programs. The Jobs in the Woods program creates educational opportunities and full-time jobs in the field of forest and watershed restoration and hazardous fuels reduction. Agency professionals teach unemployed workers and college and high school students employable skills, enabling workers to provide cost-effective services like boundary marking, timber cruising, fitting, pruning, piling of woody biomass, and collection of water samples for land management agencies. In the process, we restore health to our national forest, create wildlife habitat, and reduce wildfire danger. As an example, our Sweeney Hill fuels reduction project reduces the risk of wildland fire danger to life, property, and the natural resources adjacent to our community. By removing insect- and disease-affected trees, we jumpstart the economy and employ and train local contractors and Youth Corps as they assist the agencies in meeting their land management goals. Stewardship contracts allow for these treatments, while partnership and assistance agreements allow for the agency staff to train willing workers. The logs and slash that result from this project were sent to our small business incubator for the production of wholesale and retail products, and provide logs to the remaining lumber mill in our county, while low-grade materials are used to heat the incubator facility in our new dry kiln. Our business incubator provides necessary infrastructure for the startup and growth of businesses that utilize small diameter standing dead and other timber in the manufacture of quality products, creating local jobs and diversifying our economic base. Providing this infrastructure is also critical to reducing high fuel loads and removing woody biomass from our national forest at affordable rates. To increase the success, the program builds capacity through business development and management courses, access to micro loan programs, and marketing of products. My region has been embroiled in conflict and gridlock, to the point of a zero cut and loss of industry capacity. That just doesn't work. We believe that solution-oriented collaboration is the way to reduce the conflict and the litigation that has adversely impacted the health and vitality of our forest and our communities. As a member of the Clearwater Basin Collaborative, I have seen lines of communication open among diverse stakeholders, from local community, environmental, and recreational organizations to county, agency, and tribal governments. Identification of common ground, mutual respect, and concern for the forest we all love has joined us in an effort to improve forest health and our rural economy. I would like to highlight two promising initiatives. The first is the Great American Outdoors Initiative, which will help us prepare the next generation of Forest Service, BLM, and National Park employees by engaging and training rural youth during summer employment. Our Youth Corps works in the forest on fuels reduction, as well as assist disabled and senior citizens to create defensible space around their homes, maintains recreational trails, and improves aquatic and wildlife habitat. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act is broadly supported by a wide array of interests that in the past rarely agreed on forest issues. It allows for landscape-scale treatments, provides consistent supply of raw materials necessary for private investment, and facilitates collaborative restoration. We are excited about the CFLR projects, and think that they will be a great tool to use in collaboratively restoring health to our forests and communities. I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. The way we manage our Federal lands directly affects the well-being of our rural communities, and when our forests are healthy, our communities are stronger. For us, there is a direct correlation between these degraded forests and poverty in our rural communities. We know this will take time, and its success depends on communities, land management agencies, environmentalists, industry, and others working together to find solutions and build these integrated programs. It will take Congress to provide the direction and authorities to conduct business in this new way, and to appropriate funds for agency budgets and allow those agencies to utilize existing programs like those in Titles II and III of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. Framing Our Community and the organizations that you will hear today on the panel are ready to conduct restoration-based business, and are excited to be working on this with you today. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Dearstyne follows:] Statement of Joyce Dearstyne, Executive Director, Framing Our Community, Inc. Dear Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am Joyce Dearstyne, Executive Director of Framing Our Community, a grass-roots community-based organization with eleven years of experience in regional collaboration, working in federal partnerships and creating jobs in my community. I appreciate the opportunity to testify on the potential of building rural prosperity in partnership with federal land management agencies and to share our hands-on experiences and perspectives regarding community involvement in restoration of our National Forests and on private lands. Framing Our Community (FOC), a nonprofit organization founded in , is located in one of the largest counties--in size--in the lower forty eight states; % of our forest and rangeland is owned and managed by the Federal government. My town, Elk City, is surrounded by , acres managed by the Bureau of Land Management and . million acres of Nez Perce National Forest. Our community is, understandably, closely connected to these public lands and relies upon these resources not only for clean water, air and recreation, but also for jobs and is essential to our economic stability. Framing Our Community -who we are and what we do: Eleven years ago, the residents of Elk City formed Framing Our Community (FOC) to identify the community's desired path away from being ``suppliers'' for a commodity-based economy to entrepreneurs creating products with a higher margin of profit and offering ecological services that diversify our economic base. Focusing on value-added product development and increasing access to wholesale and retail markets will eliminate the boom and bust cycles of the past. Our vision is to sustain a ``Healthy Forest and Healthy Community.'' Our mission is to provide integrated programs that create jobs, improve forest and watershed conditions and increase educational opportunities. We are dedicated to working collaboratively to find solutions and end conflict over the natural resources that affect the prosperity of our community and others who share our challenges. Our strengths are in job creation in the woods and in the community, improving forest and water conditions, as well as wildfire fuel reduction. We have succeeded by training displaced workers and employing workers in forest restoration and related skills so they can find work on federal land management projects. We employ these workers as part of FOC's field crew or contract their services to collect water samples and monitor the streams and rivers; conduct plant, wildlife and archeological surveys; thin overcrowded forest stands to remove diseased and insect infested trees and reduce fuel loads; and revegetate degraded sites with native seed plants. We have also partnered with landowners to perform work on private lands, further expanding the market for these services. We have reduced the risk for business start-ups through our business incubator program by providing manufacturing space, business development and management courses and marketing assistance. We have sought out technical assistance and partnerships to ensure our projects incorporate advanced engineering and can engage in the global market place. We have done all of this collaboratively working in tandem with land management agencies, regional nonprofits, environmentalists, recreationists and county government. Over the past decade we have invested more than $ , , in ecosystem improvements, community infrastructure, and economic development in North Central Idaho. National Fire Plan, Economic Action program, state and private foundation funds have built business infrastructure at our Small Business Incubator/Business Park and capacity through consultants and agency expert staff who teach forest restoration and ecosystem management services. We foster the production and marketing of products that result from these activities, and provide business and natural resource education for community youth and adults. We have created a variety of jobs in our community, including hiring organizational staff, employing a field crew, sub-contracting to local contractors, and assisting with the creation of small businesses, who in turn hire local people. Our projects included forest stewardship, water quality monitoring, conducting ecological and archeological botany surveys and inventories, value-added wood production and sales by artisans through FOC's E-commerce website (www.framingourcommunity.org). In , we created seasonal and year-around jobs. Five successful highlights from our projects and activities: . Natural Resource Education and FOC's Youth Corps FOC's natural resource education program focuses on the health and vitality of the surrounding rivers and streams with water monitoring and testing, replanting along waterways which are spawning and rearing streams for salmon, steelhead, and bull trout. Displaced timber workers collect water samples for the Nez Perce National Forest under a five year agreement, while our youth engagement component focuses on college and high school students learning how to collect native seeds and cuttings, returning them to watersheds the following year. These plants are propagated by local nurseries and replanted to reduce sediment, pathogens and stream temperatures, improving aquatic and terrestrial habitat. Funding sources are scant, but our youth Corps has a workforce of ten. Corps members also assist disabled and older community members create defensible space around their homes. They educate landowners by distributing FOC's national award winning video ``Are We Safe from Fire? Protecting Idaho's Communities.'' This video shows land and home owners how to protect families and property from wildfires. . The Elk City Business Incubator We needed to build the infrastructure to train workers and contractors with the skills and knowledge that will make them competitive for work on public lands and we recognized the new role that we as a community-based organization had in facilitating the development of a newly focused private sector. In public lands communities, the private sector is reticent to invest in equipment needed to harvest and process material not traditionally used in the wood products sector due to an inconsistent program of work on federal lands. Community organizations, like ours, have stepped up to share the risk, enter into public-private partnerships to prove out new technologies and share the responsibility of working with a Federal agency. The Business Incubator was developed through a community-driven process and resulted in the establishment of an integrated wood utilization facility. We have focused on adding as much value to the raw material as possible to ensure we can capture the highest market value and in turn offer a better package to the Forest Service, enabling them to restore more acres within the confines of their budget. We have also created an integrated woody biomass utilization facility where value-added manufacturing is co-located with a small- scale energy facility. For example, using wood to create thermal energy - either in heat only or combined heat and power/biofuels applications - has more market value per unit energy than using it to generate electricity only. Creating this higher biomass value allows federal agencies and contractors to harvest and transport the material cost effectively and can reduce treatment costs per acre. Additionally our business incubator provides the infrastructure for the startup and growth of businesses that manufacture quality products from small diameter and dead trees and other natural resources from the forest. Tenant businesses utilize small diameter and standing dead timber in the manufacture of quality products, creating significant economic benefits through job creation. Providing infrastructure for the manufacturing of value-added products and full utilization of woody biomass is critical to removing high fuel loads from our forests at an affordable rate. We are able to provide the infrastructure, offer low cost tenant fees, assist entrepreneurs with connections to brokers and markets, accessing micro-loan programs, assistance to attend trade shows, the ability to conduct e-commerce and print professional grade marketing portfolios. This past Spring we began offering entrepreneurs an session business start-up course. The course is providing training and education to start a business, conduct market research, handle daily operations and human resources, access funding sources and understand finance options, and create a business and marketing plan. Our first class will graduate in November ; our second session starting this winter is already half full. These endeavors improve the quality of life through economic development and the creation of year-around employment. Federal funding for this infrastructure has come from several programs within the USDA Forest Service including the National Fire Plan, Economic Action Programs, Woody Biomass Utilization, and State and Private Forestry Cooperative Partnership Program. A grant from USDA Rural Development enabled us to acquire a dry kiln to support the needs of our business tenants, preparing their products for interstate and international markets. But the bulk of the funds come from private foundation grants. The very successful Economic Action Program has not been funded in the past few years and no replacement program has emerged. Requests for manufacturing space from five new and growing businesses require a tripling of incubator space to accommodate production needs. This growth would increase local employment by approximately percent. Since the closing of our timber mill in , the incubator has helped our community reverse its out-migration and has seen the start of a restoration-based and value-added products economy, but without the continuation of a federal program similar to the Economic Action Program, success stories like this are likely to be rare. . Training in natural resource stewardship FOC's ``Jobs in the Woods'' program creates educational opportunities and full-time jobs in the fields of hazardous fuels reduction and forest and watershed restoration. Natural resource professionals, unemployed timber workers and college and high school students learn how to apply treatments that restore health to our national forest and create defensible space on private lands. Where possible, this is accomplished with the use of low impact equipment that creates the least amount of soil and vegetative disturbance and at a low cost per acre treated. FOC has used turn of the century skills, like dry stone masonry, to repair wilderness trails and improve wildlife and anadromous fish habitat. . Agreements and Stewardship contracts with the BLM and FS. FOC and the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service have entered into several stewardship contracts to reduce the risk of wildland fire to life, property and natural resources in Elk City and the surrounding area. By removing insect and disease affected trees and addressing existing challenges through the creation or saving of jobs we are jumpstarting the economy. The acre Sweeney Hill project created four logging, eight restoration, four trucking and ten youth corps jobs. FOC has entered into several ``Partnership and Assistance Agreements,'' based on the Manpower Act, through which agency experts have trained and hired local workers to conduct boundary marking, timber cruising, thinning, pruning, hand piling and replanting of native species. Since , FOC has provided the BLM with trained and qualified people for field data collection for the biological, botanical and cultural resources programs. These are primarily recent college graduates who are building their resumes and gaining work experience. As an example, the South Fork Clearwater River Monitoring Project monitors water quality and aquatic habitat conditions along the mainstem of the South Fork Clearwater River. This monitoring plan addresses the sediment-related issues in the mainstem South Fork Clearwater River, regardless of the source of direction. Specific water column parameters sampled are suspended sediment, turbidity and bedload sediment, cobble embeddedness, particle size distribution, and pool depth. The fieldwork is conducted by two nonprofit organizations and lab work is conducted by the Elk City Water Laboratory; oversight and training has been done by federal and state agency personnel. Existing agreement authorities were used. This five-year project trained and employed - workers annually, monitoring of two additional rivers has created months of employment. . Local and regional collaborative efforts Collaboration is a great tool for resolving natural resource management conflict. It can break the gridlock, controversy, and litigation that adversely impact the health and vitality of our national forests and communities. It brings diverse stakeholders together (community, environmental, recreation, county and tribal governments) to solve a common problem or achieve a common objective. As a member of the Clearwater Basin Collaborative, I have witnessed the opening of lines of communication and growth of respect, identification of common ground and concern for the forests we all love. We have already seen the benefit of collaboration when an appeal was withdraw on a project reviewed and visited by CBC members. Conflict and litigation are down, moving treatments forward and using agency dollars for management rather than legal fees. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Act is an excellent example of collaborative processes and funding of landscape scale projects designed by federal land management agencies and collaborative groups. Challenges we still need to overcome: Despite our successes, North Central Idaho continues to face significant economic challenges; unemployment remains at . %, county budgets are declining, and our county poverty rates are . % with community rates at %. In a landscape predominately owned and managed by the federal government, we will need increased and sustained investment to retain and create new infrastructure that fits the restoration and stewardship work needed on our public lands. We need technical assistance and support to catalyze entrepreneurs and create conditions that will offer our young people a reason to return to the community and be part of our future. Key challenges include: Reduced agency staff and budget capacity impacts small and micro businesses across Idaho. For example, the combination of reduced and inconsistent funding (delays in budget approval) and the shifting direction of federal agencies have made it very difficult for the private sector to prepare to serve the restoration economy. Lack of infrastructure for manufacturing that makes use of traditionally low-value species feasible and economically viable makes it hard for businesses to get started. Being located in a high poverty, remote location that is distant from transportation corridors makes accessing urban markets challenging. Having both inconsistent offerings of restoration work and unpredictable supplies of wood sources from the surrounding public lands (from restoration projects or traditional timber projects) creates an environment where it is difficult to update, reestablish or create new businesses. Having a relatively small population density, it is difficult to recruit and retain a skilled workforce when there is no consistent program of work on federal lands. Given the uncertainty in federal land management and the surrounding large federal ownership patterns it is very difficult to raise private capital to support retooling of existing businesses or entice new businesses to establish in communities like ours. Federal contracting is inconsistent in providing a level playing field for rural businesses to compete for restoration contracts. Large contracts are written in the name of efficiency, but limit the ability of small and micro- businesses to successfully compete. A greater emphasis on quality of the work, rather than lowest bid is needed. Best value contracting can help federal agencies ensure excellent value for the federal government and American taxpayers. Recommendations: I would like now to offer some recommendations on what can be done to overcome the challenges noted above, support the momentum of the successes we have had and promote opportunities through the U.S.D.A Forest Service and Rural Development, Department of Interior, and Congress to encourage job creation in the forest communities. . Support the next generation of rural conservation leadership by supporting the President's Great American Outdoors initiative. This could help to create the next generation of Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service employees by engaging and training rural youth during summer employment. . Fully support and use existing programs to reach their potential. Federal agencies should work together to invest and provide grants, loans, and technical support to public land community training programs; increasing access to capital for low-impact or innovative equipment that can improve forest management; and building appropriately scaled manufacturing and energy facilities that can serve local markets and feed into regional, national, and even global markets, if appropriate. Existing programs such as the Forest Service Economic Action Program, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, Titles II and III, and the Community Wood Energy Program (CWEP), should be fully funded and utilized. . Level the playing field for rural businesses through improved federal contracting. The agencies need to ensure that work offered on public lands is awarded on a best value basis, including criteria for local economic benefit. Awareness, clarity, simplification and training on the full suite of available existing contracting and new authorities should be provided to the field. For example, Partnership and Assistance Agreements are great tools for the agency to work with nonprofits, providing for cost effective services, training and local jobs. . Support Investment in Conservation-based Businesses. Successful conservation-based businesses will require investment-- both on the land management and manufacturing sides--in new equipment, training and recruitment of new employees, and partnerships with communities and agencies. We also need to determine how the Small Business Administration targets forest-based businesses and whether they offer their services at the local level. The HUB Zone program seems to be one SBA program that is proving itself useful in helping local contractors win contracts. . Invest in Research and Technology Development. Creating a restoration economy necessitates that the public and private sectors develop new techniques and approaches to treat the land and handle restoration by-products. The Department of Energy needs to work with rural communities and help federal land management agencies with scalable energy solutions. For example, DOE's National Renewable Energy Lab needs to develop small-scale pollution control devices for wood-fired systems. The USDA Forest Service's Forest Products Lab in Madison, Wisconsin has been an excellent resource and has worked with rural communities and businesses. To ensure the success of the Forest Products Lab, it is essential that Congress provide adequate support and direction to enable its employees to work with more communities and small businesses to: Test and develop value-added products Create and understand light touch management techniques and equipment Understand the impacts of restoration forestry. . Foster and provide incentives for development of appropriately scaled energy facilities. By investing in the building of small distributed power and synthetic fuel facilities we can encourage long-term sustainability, in which demand is less likely to exceed supply and will provide for long-term employment and stability. Specifically, Congress should: Improve and extend production tax credits for new generation based on a minimum efficiency threshold to encourage the best use of wood for energy Account for thermal energy in renewable energy legislation such as qualifying the thermal energy output of a small combined heat and power (CHP) facility to fill a portion of any Renewable Electricity Standards. . Continue and Increase Support for the Forest Landscape Restoration Act. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act (FLRA) of facilitates collaborative restoration of priority forest landscapes using the best-available science. The FLRA is broadly supported by a wide array of interests that in the past rarely agreed on forest issues. The forming of collaborative processes like the Clearwater Basin Collaborative have opened lines of communication and identified common ground among industry, environmental and community organizations. Across the nation, community stakeholders are anxious to begin the important work that will restore forest landscapes, help to revive local economies, and reduce wildfire suppression costs and risks. FLRA will help reduce the risk of fire and costs associated with fire management and it will stimulate local economies through the creation of jobs. We hope that CFLRA projects will be fully appropriated in the future ($ million vs. $ million in ) and more widely applied. . Reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools legislation: Look at reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools Act with an eye towards economic development in those communities in or adjacent to National Forests. Title III Resource Advisory Council dollars could be used to transition the economic base of natural resource dependent communities. Currently these funds are used solely on the national forests to augment Forest Service budgets for wildlife studies, NEPA and other Environmental Impact Studies. Conclusions Thank you for the opportunity to share our experiences in building sustainability through a restoration-based program that fosters the growth of value-added businesses. While many of the issues I have raised relate to appropriations, I believe it is important that the Resources Committee advocate for these important programs in addition to providing the Forest Service with direction and authority to conduct its business. The main messages we would like to leave with you are: The way in which we care for the land directly affects the well-being of rural communities. When our forests are healthy, our communities are stronger. For us, there is a direct correlation between degraded land and poverty in rural communities. We need to restructure the way we take care of the land to create a healthy interdependence. This will take time and its success depends on communities, land management agencies, environmentalists, industry, and others working together to find solutions to building integrated programs and funding sources. ______ Mr. Grijalva. Mr. Wes Curtis, Vice President for Government Relations and Regional Services, Southern Utah University, Cedar City, Utah. Welcome, sir. I look forward to your comments. STATEMENT OF WES CURTIS, VICE PRESIDENT FOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND REGIONAL SERVICES, SOUTHERN UTAH UNIVERSITY, CEDAR CITY, UTAH Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Wes Curtis. I am Vice President for Government Relations and Regional Services at Southern Utah University, and formerly a point person for two Utah Governors on rural affairs and public lands issues. And I appreciate this opportunity to talk to you about Southern Utah University's outdoor initiatives and partnerships as they relate to the public lands, job training, and the land management agencies in southern Utah. Having been actively involved in Utah public lands issues for over two decades, I have learned that public lands are viewed by many in rural Utah as both a blessing and a curse. I have also come to recognize that regardless of how one feels about the Federal lands and their management, their existence and the agencies that manage them are a reality that we live with. And within that reality, in addition to the challenges, there are also many opportunities to be cultivated and developed. At SUU, we are trying to make the most of these opportunities. Without our service region, we count three national parks, five national monuments, a national recreation area, numerous state parks, and millions of acres of BLM and Forest Service lands. Eighty to ninety percent of lands that surround us are public lands, and these lands influence our lifestyles, culture, and economy in many ways, both positive and negative, in ways subtle and overt. Southern Utah University's location in the midst of these world class landscapes is one of the primary things that sets us apart from other institutions of higher learning, and we feel compelled to make the most of this unique setting, both for the enhancement of student experience and for the benefit of our regional community and economy. At SUU, we are actively engaged in what we call our outdoor initiatives. These initiatives are directed at outdoor education, career training, and recreation opportunities for our students, working together in mutually beneficial partnerships with Federal and state agencies, providing assistance to local government in addressing public land issues, developing career path opportunities for students within Federal and state agencies, and within tourism and recreation industries. We are also viewed in our region as a resource through the Federal land management agencies, providing them with research projects, artistic and scientific resources, and as a provider of numerous student interns to meet their staffing needs. We are currently working to bring all of these initiatives together under the umbrella of a Southern Utah University Outdoor Center, and have an appropriation request through Congressman Jim Matheson and Senator Robert Bennett to help us launch this center. And with the focus of this Subcommittee on jobs related to the public lands, I want to talk about some of our career path training opportunities. These include, number one, a bachelor's degree in hotel, resort, and hospitality management, and also a bachelor's degree in outdoor recreation and parks and tourism. The hotel, resort, and hospitality management degree gives students skills in the hospitality management industry, and they take jobs with hotels, resorts, food service operations, convention centers, and even in transportation. The outdoor recreation degree has three distinct areas of emphasis, which allows students to specialize their focus depending on whether they want to pursue careers in public lands management, outdoor education, or tourism. In only its fourth year of existence, this program has already placed students in full-time jobs within the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, with private sector companies, and with state parks in two different states. And it is interesting to note that almost every one of these job placements through the outdoor recreation degree program has been the result of a student participating in an internship with the hiring agency. Southern Utah University has emerged as a national model in the placement of student interns with Federal and state land management agencies. This is done through our inter- governmental internship cooperative, whose mission includes the development of public lands leaders for tomorrow. With grant funds through the National Park Service, including a shared National Park staff position, and in partnering with the Forest Service and BLM, we have placed dozens of students in paid internship positions, including such things as accounting, public affairs, visitor services, interpretation, forest management, and fuels reduction. In fact, as we speak, over students are benefitting from these full-time internship opportunities, including a National Park Service Service Corps crew. And as a spinoff of this, we now host a public lands employment day, a career fair that spotlights the numerous land management agencies, and helps students learn about the application process and how to apply for employment. With that overview, I would direct your attention to my testimony, which highlights many of our other outdoor initiative projects and partnerships. And from that, I hope you will see that the scope of SUU's outdoor programs and initiatives is very much more than just jobs training. It is a reflection of the impact that the public lands have on our lives in this region of the West. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Curtis follows:] Statement of Wes Curtis, Vice President for Government Relations and Regional Services, Southern Utah University Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the Sub-committee, my name is Wes Curtis. I am the Vice President for Government Relations and Regional Services at Southern Utah University, and formerly a point person for two Utah Governors on rural affairs and public lands issues. I appreciate this opportunity to talk to you about Southern Utah University's outdoor initiatives and partnerships as they relate to the public lands, career training, and the land management agencies in southern Utah. Having been actively involved with Utah public lands issues for over two decades, I have learned that the public lands are viewed by many in Utah as both a blessing and a curse. The controversies and contentions surrounding the management of these lands are almost as expansive as the lands themselves. I have also come to recognize that regardless of how one feels about the federal lands and their management, their existence, and the agencies that manage them, are a reality that we live with, and within that reality, in addition to the challenges, there are also many opportunities to be cultivated and developed. At SUU we are trying to make the most of these opportunities. Within the sphere of the Southern Utah University service area, we count three national parks (Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Capitol Reef), five national monuments (Cedar Breaks, Pipe Springs, Grand Staircase- Escalante, Grand Canyon Parshonts, Vermillion Cliffs), a National Recreation Area (Glen Canyon), numerous state parks, as well as millions of acres of BLM and Forest Service lands. Eighty to ninety percent of the lands that surround us are public lands, and these lands influence our lifestyles, culture, and economy in many ways--in positive ways and negative ways, in subtle ways and overt ways. Southern Utah University's location in the midst of these world- class landscapes and natural resources is one of the primary things that sets SUU apart from other institutions of higher learning, and we feel compelled to make the most of this unique setting, both for the enhancement of the student experience and for the benefit of the regional community and economy. At Southern Utah University, we are actively engaged in what we call our Outdoor Initiatives. These initiatives are directed at providing outdoor education, career training, and recreation opportunities for our students; working together in mutually beneficial partnerships with federal and state agencies; providing assistance to local government in addressing public lands issues and opportunities; and developing career path opportunities for students within federal and state agencies and within the tourism and recreation industries. Within our region we are recognized and serve as a resource to the land management agencies, providing them with research projects, artistic and scientific resources, a liaison to local communities, and a provider of numerous student interns to meet their staffing needs. We are also about to launch a Demonstration Forest Project on SUU's , acre mountain ranch property, to serve as a living laboratory and model for best practices in such things as forest health, fuels reduction, and range management. We are currently working to bring all of these various initiatives together under the umbrella of a Southern Utah University Outdoor Center, and have an appropriation request through Congressman Jim Matheson and Senator Robert Bennett to help launch this Center. With that overview, I would like to highlight some of our numerous outdoor initiative projects and partnerships. Hopefully, you will see that the scope of SUU's outdoor programs and initiatives is very much more than just job training. It is a reflection of the impact that the public lands have on our lives in this region of the West: First and foremost, Southern Utah University is a student-focused institution of higher education. With an enrollment of , students, we have a distinct niche within the Utah System of Higher Education. SUU is dedicated to giving students a private school type experience-- with personalized instruction, small classes, highly qualified faculty, and experience based learning--within the public institution structure of Utah's higher education system. Constantly cognizant of the grandeur of its setting, SUU has developed numerous academic and regional service programs that connect the university community to the surrounding lands and the economic, cultural, artistic and scientific opportunities they provide. Bachelors Degrees SUU offers two bachelor's degrees that have very direct connections to the tourism and outdoor recreation sectors of the state's economy. These are ) a Bachelor Degree in Hotel, Resort, and Hospitality Management, and ) a Bachelor's Degree in Outdoor Recreation in Parks and Tourism. The Hotel, Resort and Hospitality Management degree gives students the skills and training for successful careers in hospitality management in such areas as lodging, retail, restaurants and recreational activities. These students take jobs with hotels, resorts, food service operations, convention centers and even transportation. These students have also been involved in developing customer service strategies for large destination resorts, such as Ruby's Inn at Bryce Canyon National Park, and conducting extensive visitor profile research for the Utah Office of Travel and Tourism. The Outdoor Recreation degree has three distinct areas of emphasis which allow students to specialize their educational focus, depending on whether they want to pursue career opportunities in public lands management, outdoor education, or tourism. In only its fourth year of existence, this program has already placed students in full-time jobs within the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, with private sector companies, and with state parks in two states. Internships--The Intergovernmental Internship Cooperative Almost every one of the job placements through the Outdoor Recreation degree program as been the direct result of the student participating in an internship with the hiring agency. Southern Utah University has emerged as a national leader and model in the placement of student interns with federal and state land management agencies. This is done through the Intergovernmental Internship Cooperative (IIC), whose mission includes the development of the public lands leaders of tomorrow by providing students interested in agency careers with internships and other service and learning opportunities. With grant funds through the National Park Service--including a shared NPS/SUU staff position--and through working partnerships with the BLM, U.S. Forest Service, and Utah Department of Natural Resources, the Intergovernmental Internship Cooperative has placed dozens of students in paid internship positions within the partnering agencies. These internships include on-the-job experiences in such things as accounting, public affairs, visitor services, interpretation, forest management and fuels reduction projects. Many of these are specific career path placements. This summer, over students are benefitting from these full-time internship opportunities--including an NPS Service Corp crew. IIC's Public Lands Employment Day In cooperation with SUU's state and federal land management agency partners, IIC now hosts an annual ``Public Lands Employment Day'' career fair at SUU. While career fairs are the norm on college campuses, our Public Lands Employment Day spotlights the numerous land management agencies across our region and provides SUU students with the opportunity to learn about and begin the application process for agency employment, particularly in advance of the summer hiring season. Workshops on how to apply for federal jobs, along with other student training sessions provided by agency staff, are also part of this highly successful career fair. Experiential Learning and Outdoor Engagement Over the past year there has been much interest and excitement generated at Southern Utah University through the development of a new Academic Roadmap, under the direction of Provost Brad Cook. Central to this strategic academic direction is the soon-to-be-added experiential learning requirement for graduation. This will require that students participate in specific real-world learning opportunities as part of their SUU experience, and complete a capstone project through one of five Centers for Student Engagement. In recognition of the importance of the public lands in this region, one of these five centers will be the Center for Outdoor Engagement. (Other Centers include Leadership, Civic Engagement, International Studies, and Creativity and Innovation.) In addition to the broadened student experience opportunities that will be created through the Outdoor Engagement Center, SUU is also working with Bryce Canyon National Park to create a Semester in the Parks, giving students the rare opportunity to live and learn in a national park, with the park as their classroom. In fact, we already jokingly refer to Bryce Canyon National Park as our ``eastern campus.'' Alliance for Education Agreements with the National Parks The genesis of many of the projects and partnerships of the SUU Outdoor Initiative can be found in the formal Alliance for Education agreements executed between SUU and Bryce Canyon National Park and with the Zion Group, consisting of Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks National Monument, and Pipe Springs National Monument. These respective agreements establish a formal cooperative and mutually beneficial working relationship between SUU and the region's national parks and monuments. These partnerships provide a world-class education and research venue for SUU students and faculty. In return, the signatory National Parks and monuments get access to the resources and expertise of the University. As an example of how this agreement furthers the missions of all the entities involved, SUU staff participated on the Zion Centennial Planning Committee, and SUU faculty, staff, and students planned and participated in numerous activities as part of the Zion Centennial Celebration. Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument (GSENM) Memorandum of Understanding Patterned after the University's successful Alliance for Education agreements with Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks, the objectives of this Memorandum Of Understanding between SUU and Grand Staircase- Escalante NM are to establish a general framework of cooperation upon which mutually beneficial science, research, and education programs; service projects; training seminars; internships; and curriculum development opportunities and other activities may be planned and accomplished in such a ways as to complement the missions of the BLM, GSENM, and SUU, and in the best interest of the public. Since its signature in , numerous activities have occurred at the Monument that benefit students, faculty, staff, monument employees and surrounding communities and their residents. It is our contention that these unique agreements--the Alliances for Education and the GSENM MOU--positively enhance the University's relationship with our agency partners while formalize our commitment to providing service to the parks and monuments as well as the surrounding communities. In return, SUU students gain an undeniable competitive advantage in their post-education, professional endeavors. The SUU Mountain Ranch and Demonstration Forest Southern Utah University is fortunate to own , acres of mountain forest lands in Cedar Canyon, miles east of the main campus, and near Cedar Breaks National Monument and the Ashdown Gorge Wilderness Area. A resource management plan for the property has been developed over the past two years focusing on wise management of the property's forest, recreation, range, and grazing resources as well as its research and educational potential. Through SUU's planning leadership, we have reached out to adjacent landowners--including the U.S. Forest Service--to complete a Community Wildfire Protection Plan. As a result of this wildfire protection planning effort, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds are being used this summer to implement the objectives of this plan using SUU student labor. One of the outcomes of this planning process is a partnership between Southern Utah University and the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands to create a one-of-a-kind ``demonstration forest.'' Utilizing the expertise of the State of Utah, along with participation from other universities, sections of this property will be managed as living models of forest health and range management best practices. Forest Service and private property owners alike will be able to view and understand state-of-the-art management techniques, and monitor them over time. Colorado Plateau Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit (CESU) SUU joins non-federal partners along with seven federal natural resource management agencies to form the Colorado Plateau Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit (CPCESU). The CPCESU creates opportunities for research, education and technical assistance to support stewardship of natural and cultural resources by federal agencies on the Colorado Plateau. The CPCESU ensures that the expertise of academic and non-governmental partners is made available to assist federal resource managers in accomplishing their agency missions. SUU students, faculty and staff from across campus have benefitted from this positive relationship, and SUU is recognized as one of the most active CESU members with nearly contracts and agreements in place with agency partners in just the past four years. These agreements take advantage of SUU faculty and staff, and provide students with real-world experiences, to meet the research, work and service needs of the land management agencies. Intergovernmental Coordination--The Southwest Utah Planning Authorities Council With the belief that communication and coordination between various levels of government can lead to improved cooperation and better solutions to issues facing southern Utah, Southern Utah University hosts and chairs bi-monthly field trips and meetings during which federal and state agency directors meet with local government officials from throughout the region under the auspices of the Southwest Utah Planning Authorities Council (SUPAC). SUPAC was established in by then-Governor Michael O. Leavitt to serve as a non-binding forum for discussion of issues, grievances, misunderstandings, and disputes among the participants, and to serve as a clearinghouse for the exchange of information relative to the planning processes and activities of the participants. Over the years, this forum has proved to be very beneficial in improving intergovernmental relationships and establishing comfortable lines of communication between public land managers and state and local government leaders. County Resource Management Planning Southern Utah University is working with three counties within the region to develop County Resource Management Plans for the public lands within these counties. This is a nationally significant effort to collaboratively and pro-actively address planning and management issues from the local level, utilizing a planning model developed by SUU personnel. This planning model mirrors in many ways the BLM's Resource Management Planning process, but it is driven by local government and by local perspectives on the impacts and management of public lands resources. It is important to note that these county planning processes are not done in a vacuum, but are done in collaboration with the land management agencies. The Utah Prairie Dog Recovery Implementation Program The Utah Prairie Dog--protected as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act since --has long been a vexing issue for land owners and developers in parts of Southern Utah. Southern Utah University is playing a leading role in bringing together over federal, state, and local partners as part of the Utah Prairie Dog Recovery Implementation Program (UPDRIP). The UPDRIP partners have two primary goals: The first is to recover the Utah prairie dog so that it no longer requires protection under the Endangered Species Act; the second is to allow landowners to develop lands historically inhabited by the prairie dog. SUU houses and provides administrative support to the Director of UPDRIP within the College of Science. This proximity to the science faculty provides the director with convenient access to academic and scientific expertise to assist in developing and implementing a recovery plan for the prairie dogs. Zion National Park Artist in Residence The re-emerging Zion National Park Artist in Residence initiative is a new and exciting partnership between SUU's College of Performing and Visual Arts' Arts Administration Program, Braithwaite Fine Arts Gallery, graduate students in the Master of Fine Arts Program, and Zion National Park. Through the program development and arts expertise of these SUU entities, Zion has been able to re-establish this defunct program and artists from around the world have applied to be selected as an artist in residence. The new and improved Zion NP Artist in Residence Program hosted its first artist in early at the Park's recently restored Grotto House. Partners in the Parks Southern Utah University manages the Partners in the Parks program for the National Collegiate Honors Council. This program is currently recognized by the National Park Service as a NPS Centennial Initiative Project. This program gives honors students from across the nation the opportunity to have week-long academic and learning experiences within the National Parks. The Utah Rural Summit For the past years, Southern Utah University has hosted the annual Utah Rural Summit. This Summit began as a forum for discussing public lands issues, and has since evolved to include economic and community development components as well. At the core of each Summit gathering is a public lands track, in which local and state leaders from across the state have the opportunity to engage in discussion with key leaders and experts on public lands matters from throughout the West. Zion National Park/Danxiashan World Geopark Sister Park SUU's Office of Government Relations and Regional Services has been an active partner with Zion National Park in the development of a ``sister park'' relationship with Danxiashan World Geopark in Guangdong Province, P.R. China. Higher education is a key component of this relationship, which includes Sun Yat-sen University and SUU. Visits to both parks and universities occurred in late and early by delegations from each country. Youth Science and Outdoor Education Director at SUU This position at SUU was created in early . Along with oversight of the Cedar Mountain Science Camp program and the University's new Voyager Science Lab, positive success is also being achieved by working with local school districts and public lands agency partners to develop new programs such as the U.S. Forest Service's More Kids in the Woods program, National Park Service's First Bloom program, and numerous other agency-desired partnership projects. In fact, assisting local public lands offices develop these agency-funded programs is a priority for this position. Local agency offices typically do not have the capacity to develop and/or manage these programs that can greatly benefit the community. Zion National Park/Danxiashan World Geopark Sister Park SUU's Office of Government Relations and Regional Services has been an active partner with Zion National Park in the development of a ``sister park'' relationship with Danxiashan World Geopark in Guangdong Province, P.R. China. Higher education is a key component of this relationship, which includes Sun Yat-sen University and SUU. Visits to both parks and universities occurred in late and early by delegations from each country. SUU Outdoors Founded in Spring , SUU Outdoors is home to the publicly accessible Outdoor Center, which offers a wide variety of year-round trips, equipment rentals and training, and other outdoor resources and expertise. The Outdoor Center also manages the on-campus low ropes challenge course and the popular new indoor climbing wall. Other special events are scheduled throughout the school year such as gear swaps and the annual Warren Miller ski film. SUU Outdoors maintains many formal partnerships and affiliations including local organizations such as the Color Country Cycle Club, Cedar Mountain Nordic Ski Club, and the Southern Utah Climbers Coalition. Conclusion In conclusion, it is evident that Southern Utah University plays a vital role as a partner and resource in public lands matters, bringing personnel, knowledge, talent and leadership to the table. SUU is fully engaged with the federal land management agencies, and with state and local government, in maximizing the opportunities for students, faculty, communities, and the regional economy that flow from our proximity to the vast and beautiful national parks and public lands that surround us. ______ Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, sir. Mr. Bebo Lee, New Mexico Federal Lands Council, New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association, Alamogordo, New Mexico. Welcome, sir. I look forward to your comments. STATEMENT OF BEBO LEE, NEW MEXICO FEDERAL LANDS COUNCIL, NEW MEXICO CATTLE GROWERS' ASSOCIATION, ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO Mr. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee. My name is Bebo Lee. I live in southeastern New Mexico, and I am here before you today representing myself, the New Mexico Federal Lands Council, and the New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association. I thank you for the opportunity to testify before you on some concerns that have been raised by the people that live on Otero Mesa and by the Otero County Commission itself about the possibility of a national monument designation on Otero Mesa. The lack of involvement of the local government and residents in the whole process has the potential of eliminating jobs rather than creating them. Grazing of livestock has occurred on Otero Mesa for over years. The longevity of these businesses show the economical viability of the management practices. There are numerous families that have been grazing continuously on Otero Mesa at least years prior to New Mexico becoming a state in . They are proponents of multiple use, not limited use. When word first came out about the possible designation of the national monument, the agricultural community again had concerns about their livelihood and their investments. We all wondered what happened to an open and transparent government. A number of these individuals have been there through the creation of the National Forest condemnation of lands by the Holloman Air Force Base, the eviction of ranchers and condemnation of lands at White Sands Missile Range, the establishment and the eviction of ranchers of MacGregor Range, the elimination of all private holdings, and the establishment of the White Sands National Monument, which they were never compensated for, and the continued expansion of Fort Bliss Military Range. And they believe they were on the receiving end again possibly. As was experienced in past actions, there has been no official notice of a possible monument designation given or an explanation why a designation is possibly needed. It has been rumored it is to stop further oil and gas drilling, which probably makes sense because the environmental communities have cornered the ranching industry since a producing well was completed on Otero Mesa. But they have not gained any inroads, probably because of the natural trust. Several groups have proposed to make Otero Mesa a natural conservation area or wilderness, and have published considerable literature about Otero Mesa and the need to protect it. Most of these do not tell the whole story. Otero Mesa has been portrayed as . million acres of Federal domain. As you can see by a map provided, which is under Attachment A-- I believe it is up over here on the left of me--there is New Mexico State Trust land and private property intermingled with Federal land. It would be difficult to get . million acres, even including all the state trust land and private property. You may also notice there are a number of allottees who live on Otero Mesa and the surrounding areas, which are not geographically considered Otero Mesa. Was the New Mexico State Land Office or the private landowners notified about the possible designation? Shouldn't they be, as it will directly affect them if the state trust lands are traded out because of a monument designation? In the past, the New Mexico state land traded out their lands that were located within what is now MacGregor Range and Holloman Air Force Base. If the land is not swapped out, it would be landlocked and unable to generate income from wind or solar activities, leading of hunting rights, and the proposed wind and water projects, Attachment B, could be affected. In turn, the improvements agriculture had made on state lands by the lessees would be under increased scrutiny from the BLM, Bureau of Land Management, subject to new rules and regulations and possible abandonment because they may not fit into the monument's position. For that reason, the local residents should know upfront about this and be involved in the whole process. The thought is, if a monument is designated, that eventually the special rules, permits, or not meeting the goals of the mission, livestock would be removed permanently, as is the case in some national monuments. If a monument is created, it would not allow for an economic way to maintain, repair, or make new improvements, and then cattle would be sold, which would incur a loss of jobs and a tax base for Otero County. In a county with a limited tax base already because of Holloman Air Force Base, MacGregor Range, White Sands Missile Range, and the Mescalero Indian Reservation, what would the Federal Government do to compensate Otero County's tax base with? Tourism? A study from the range improvement task force at the New Mexico State University suggests that tourism would not generate that much income, which is under Attachment C. The study shows agriculture returns two dollars for every one dollar that is spent in the local community. These are some of the items that were discussed before the Otero County Commission passed ordinance - , Attachment D, so that possibly the administrative and Federal agencies would coordinate with the county before any process starts and throughout an entire process if a designation is made. One of the questions that has arisen is why the Administration trying to protect Otero Mesa from or for. When the environmental groups first came to Otero Mesa, they started promoting to protect the area. They said it was as pristine as the savannahs of Africa. At the time, Otero Mesa was in the fourth year of an eight-year drought. If they truly believed this, would it not mean that the ranchers and the BLM had been good stewards of the land for over years? As I prepared to come before you today, I inquired about the total number of power lines and meters that would fall under the designation--yes, sir. Oh, I am sorry. Yes, sir. That is all I have.

At the time Otero Mesa was in the fourth year of an eight year drought. If they truly believed this, would it not mean that the ranchers and the BLM have been good stewards of the land for over years? As I prepared to come before you today I inquired about the total number of power line miles and meters that would fall into and around the designated area. To my surprise I was told that the Department of Homeland Security would not release the number of miles and number of meters that would need to be serviced if the Monument was designated. How can you plan for routine maintenance, repair and expansion of the lines if you do not have a current data at the starting pointing? On this point, Dell Telephone Company has several hundred miles of fiber optic lines that will need to be serviced. People in rural communities rely on good communication on a daily basis for several different reasons one of which is emergency services. If a line is not working it literally could mean the difference in life and death. There are gas lines running through the area as well as the potential for wind generation. What will a monument designation do to these projects? There is a lot of misinformation regarding Otero Mesa. I would encourage Congress, the Administration and agencies to personally look at the areas and coordinate with the local government and residents before making a judgment. Why is this designation being brought forward? To protect grass land, stop oil & gas development, protect wildlife and limit grazing or for the wild lands project? (attachment E). Thank you again, for the opportunity to address the committee. I will stand for questions. Attachments: A. Otero County Map B. Wind & Water Prospectus C. Range Improvement Task Force Report D. Otero County Ordinance E. Wildlife Corridors Map [NOTE: Attachments have been retained in the Committee's official files.] ______ Mr. Grijalva. Mr. Lee, your full testimony is part of the record, and members of the Committee will have access to that full record. I want to thank you for your comments. Mr. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Grijalva. Let me begin with some questions. Dr. Moseley, what can the land management agencies--because that is part of the partnership--do with their community partners to create the long-term jobs, not the project by project jobs, but the long-term jobs. Dr. Moseley. That is a very important question. I think it is one of the critical questions we need to be asking ourselves. One of the realities of working outdoors is that the work is seasonal. Different kinds of activities can be done in different times of year. And so in that context, we really need to be thinking about how you string work together. And one of the things about contracting businesses or restoration businesses is that they are contracting firms. And typically, like many contracting firms, they have many projects, and part of their task is to string those projects together into a program of work. They keep their business open and their workers working. So part of the task is in the hands of the contracting businesses themselves. But there is a lot that the Federal land management agencies can do as well. The way they structure their contracts has a lot to do with how this can function. One thing we learned from the study that we did of the forest and watershed restoration businesses in Oregon was that for these watershed businesses, working in the streams actually extended their work season, that in the height of the summer they often were not doing restoration work. They were doing construction work, but that the forest and watershed work added to a work season a seasonal work in other industries. So that is actually a very good sign of adding restoration. In the case of the Forest Service and the BLM, one of the key things in rural communities is to think about how you structure contracts so that they are what we talk about as long and skinny rather than short and fat. You can have guys work for a month, or you can have five guys work for four months, if I am doing the math right. And in a rural community, that longer, skinnier contract is really much more valuable because getting people to show up for one month means that the next month those people are going to be working in a different community. So that is a key piece. I think the other key piece with stewardship contracting, the integration of the work on the ground and the removal allows you to put together into a single contract a large number of different activities. And as long as those activities are related to each other, you can have contracts where people can work over longer periods of the season, and you can add the removal, and then that has downstream job effects. And then I would say, third, for the communities themselves, a key task is doing worker and contractor training so that those contractors and workers can't just do--aren't able to just do one thing. They can't just thin, but they can also do the timber cruising and the surveys, and, and, and, so that you have a workforce both like on the business side and the workers who can do a variety of tasks. You can match that up with contracts where there are a variety of activities, and you keep them sized for the community, and you have a pretty good formula. Thank you. Mr. Grijalva. Yes. The question for me--because one of the points was that you mentioned at the beginning. They are not long-term, they are seasonal. And I think one of things we are probing with this hearing is how you---- Dr. Moseley. Right. Mr. Grijalva.--extend the life of the job and the project. Ms. Dearstyne, you state that reductions in staffing and Federal agencies are impeding your ability to grow jobs in the private sector in your area. Can you explain that? Ms. Dearstyne. Yes. It has been critical for us to have agency staff that is accessible and knowledgeable, and that has become more and more rare. Frequently, in our communities, we will find that a contracting or an agreements staffer is either miles away or has very little experience. And it is hard to put agreements together with people who aren't sure what their authorities allow them to do. And it makes them nervous and risk-adverse. We also find, because we do so much training on the ground, that when we started this in , that we had easy and ready access to fish biologists, hydrologists, and fire management officers. And that again is becoming more and more rare for us. We are having to put training off for months and, in one case, reschedule it for the following year--just because of the availability of staff. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. We hear so much that you need to reduce, you need to cut back. And when you lose an investment, I think there is a corresponding loss on the private sector as well, and I appreciate your answer. Mr. Curtis, in the testimony--and before I do that, I just wanted to say that Leigh von der Esch--did I say it right? Yes, thank you--of the Utah Office of Tourism will not be testifying today. She had to cancel at the last minute. Her written testimony is very compelling. I want to enter it into the record if there is no objection. And obviously, there won't be any, so it is in the record. [The statement of Leigh von der Esch submitted for the record follows:] Statement submitted for the record by Leigh von der Esch, Managing Director, Utah Office of Tourism Good morning, I am Leigh von der Esch, Managing Director of the Utah Office of Tourism in the Governor's Office of Economic Development. It is my pleasure to speak to you regarding ``Gateways to Prosperity: Managing Federal Lands to Create Rural Jobs.'' I am happy to be here to speak to you about two economic development efforts that are important to Utah on and around federal lands, tourism promotion and film production, both important economic development activities that create jobs and prosperity in our state. Utah is known worldwide for its scenic beauty. We have an abundance of riches with our natural beauty showcased within National Parks, National Monuments, National Recreation Areas, National Forests and additional beauty found on thousands of acres of Bureau of Land Management land in addition to State Parks and other state sovereign and state trust lands. Our summer advertising commercials reflect the myriad of activities that one can enjoy in Utah and on our public lands, from hiking and biking, fishing and kayaking, camping and wildlife viewing, and many other outdoor opportunities. It is truly a summer wonderland for the outdoor recreationist. With over million people visiting the state in , tourism spending in the state accounted for $ . billion dollars to our economy. Traveler spending in is estimated to have generated $ million in state and local tax revenues, and tax relief per household of the yearly amount of $ . In addition to having ``The Greatest Snow on Earth'' in the winter, with over million skier days, our summer visitors account for approximately percent of our visitation. Tourism is big business. And Utah's scenic beauty is not just a destination for the traveler, seeking outdoor recreation or reflection; it is also a destination for the filmmaker. Utah's locations have been the backdrop for the motion picture industry, originating even before director John Ford shot the iconic mittens of Monument Valley which has resulted in global recognition for that area of our state. Movies from ``Stagecoach'' and the ``Searchers'', and other John Wayne westerns, to ``Geronimo'', ``Thelma and Louise'', ``City Slickers II'' and ``John Carter of Mars'', have all relied on our scenery to move the narrative. ``John Carter of Mars'', is the largest movie ever shot on location in Utah and recently finished shooting by Disney/Pixar. The motion picture industry has brought over movies to our state, and accounted for thousands of jobs and millions of dollars to our economy. But it hasn't always been easy shooting on location, and many films and commercials were lost to other jurisdictions due to slow and confusing processes and regulations. Both tourism visitation and motion picture production provide ``Gateways to Prosperity'' and require mutual cooperation in working on and respect for our natural resources, in order to be successful economic development efforts as well as sustainable. Mutual agreement to generate any segment of our local and state economies requires communication and cooperation, as we have seen in so many communities throughout the west, no one single industry can be relied on to sustain an economy indefinitely. Prior to becoming the Managing Director of the Office of Tourism, I served for years as the state film commissioner. Since so many of the movies shot in Utah are location specific, written to capitalize on the uniqueness and beauty of our landscapes, our office interfaced with public land agencies on a regular basis. Many times our interface was frustrating, when filming schedules collided with permit processing times. In the 's the perception, if not the reality was that you could not film on Utah's public lands, or if you tried, it would be costly and complicated. Because of the regulatory perception, our motion picture production in the Moab and Monument Valley area decreased significantly in the 's. Other states in the West were finding significant and similar frustrations and we all watched as movies that could easily be shot in the United States go to other countries for their productions, where permits to film were more manageable and predictable. As Director of the State Film Commission and President of the Association of Film Commissioners International, I and others reached out to the public lands agencies to forge partnerships that allowed us to create forums to discuss the needs of the motion picture industry while in preparation for and during the shooting of films, television productions and commercial productions. As a result of those efforts, several of us participated in training sessions for film permitting, location monitoring and possible mitigation efforts that would assist the land agencies in their efforts to manage their respective natural resources, while assisting the motion picture industry. The dialogue that was created between the motion picture industry and federal land managers, allowed the motion picture industry to recognize the multiple demands placed on our public land managers in the efforts they were making with underfunded capital projects and manpower shortages. It also created an understanding of industry needs by land managers. As a result of talking and understanding, I saw many instances where motion picture companies went beyond mitigation for their activities on public lands and left instead repaired roads and facilities in areas where they shot and other contributions to the local communities. We need to continue to have dialogue about filming on public lands and forums to discuss mutual needs to assist filming on location. Filmmaking is a resource sustaining activity. Filming on location, like tourism, is big business. ``John Carter of Mars'', which I initially mentioned, resulted in $ , , dollars spent in our state over the course of months of preproduction and production and created jobs in rural communities in some of the least populated areas of the state. And for the gateway communities located near national recreation areas, national parks and BLM land, where the majority of the film's scenes were shot, those millions of dollars were left in lodging, grocery stores and lumber yards and hundreds of other purchases, in addition to being paid to hundreds of extras and crew hired locally. Movies shot on location are also the biggest promotional billboard a state could hope for in showcasing our unique and breathtaking public lands. But we can't have that promotion or resource sustaining job creation unless we work together and regulate our public lands with a process that provides for clarity, consistency and a more expeditious process. We can work together and create a process of permitting and assistance on public lands, which can provide the appropriate stewardship of our natural resources. As I mentioned earlier, tourism is big business in Utah and our visitation numbers are increasing. Our scenery in our National Parks and public lands is recognized throughout the world. Delicate Arch, in Arches National Park, is on our state license plates. Our state slogan, our brand, is ``Utah Life Elevated''. We believe our brand experience can be found any day of the year on our federal and state lands, and those public lands are showcased in our commercials, our travel publications and our calendars. In Utah, we don't just provide the scenery for the experience; we also are providing the equipment. The Outdoor Recreation industry is a major economic industry cluster in the Governor's Office of Economic Development and we are growing outdoor recreation businesses and seeing them relocate to Utah in metropolitan and rural communities. They love to test, as well as enjoy their newest outdoor recreation equipment in our state. Each January and August, Salt Lake City, Utah hosts the Outdoor Recreation Industry for their winter and summer equipment convention. In addition to bringing the latest outdoor equipment to Utah, the Outdoor Industry Association also brings those leaders in the outdoor industry who are working locally and nationally to encourage the next stewards of our public lands, as well as encourage healthy lifestyles of the young and the old through outdoor activities. Our own summer advertising kickoff included a ``get out, get active, get healthy'' message. There is no doubt that our natural resources on federal lands are a gateway to prosperity. Parks and federal lands attract visitors that energize local economies, support jobs and economic growth. Quality of life is always an attribute cited for relocation of business. We have to continue to invest in our infrastructure and continue to talk to all interested stakeholders of federal land use to continue prosperity. The economy of the West has been evolving and tourism and motion picture making has played and can continue to play a part, along with other economic development efforts for economic prosperity. We can build on relationships between federal lands and local communities. We can work with environmental groups and businesses. Future prosperity requires all interests to reach out and work together. It all begins with communication, there are hundreds of successes we can share and thousands more we can create together. Thank you. ______ Mr. Grijalva. And also for the record, and correcting Mr. DeFazio, Plymouth Rock will be celebrating its th birthday, and not its th. But anyway. Thank you. One of the points that she did make in her testimony, the state director, was that parks and Federal lands attract visitors, energize local communities, support jobs and economic growth. From your perspective, does the proximity to national parks and forests affect the economy of Cedar City? And to follow up, you have worked extensively on rural affairs for Governors of Utah, as you mentioned. How do national parks and forests help or hinder preserving the historic and rural culture that one finds in places like Cedar City? Those two questions. Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Answering your second question first, regarding preserving the history and culture of the area, that is an interesting question because the public lands and how they affect our culture, our lifestyles, and way of thinking is something that is really ingrained within us in this part of the state. It is part of our lifestyle. It is part of our way of thinking. And that is why people are so passionate for how these lands are managed, and of course, availing ourselves of these vast tracts of public lands for various purposes is something that is very much a part of our nature. But at the same time, many of our historic uses and the jobs associated with these lands are disappearing. The lifestyles associated with grazing, with logging, some of those kinds of things that are very much a part of our culture are no longer so much a part of that, and the new outdoor recreation economy is indeed new, and the technologies involved there, with ATFs and whatnot, with rock climbing type things, these are a very recent phenomenon, and it will be interesting to see how this becomes incorporated into our culture and our approaches to things. In terms of the jobs themselves and how these lands affect that, of course, we know intuitively that these lands have a lot to do with what happens there, but it is hard to measure just how much these things factor into decisions by those who locate there with second homes or retire there, or bring businesses there. We do know that the tourism industry jobs are very much a part of our economy and very much appreciated. However, they are very much low-skill, low-paying, seasonal type jobs. In fact, our neighboring county, Garfield County, which relies more on tourism than any other county, the average monthly wage there is only percent of the state's average wage. So these jobs really--we seek for higher paying jobs than we find in the tourism industry. And in fact, we get more bang for our buck in terms of dollars spent per tourist visitor day from locally sponsored attractions like our Utah Shakespearean Festival in Cedar City than we do from visitors who come to the public lands. So I hope that answers your question, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Grijalva. Mr. Lee, I don't have a question. Just thank you. And you remind me, when I had a much more pleasant job, and I was a supervisor in Pima County in southern Arizona, we put together something called a Sonoran Conservation Plan, in response to having to deal with an endangered species listing. And one of the components of that was ranches, because we felt that it was better in the long term to cooperate and set up partnerships with the stewardship that would be occurring on those ranches, and have occurred for generations, than getting into a protracted battle over the conservation plan. The alternative was that ranches, as they decline in their profitability, begin to sell off their land for development. And that development then begins to encroach on the conservation strategy. It has worked very well, and I think particularly in the West, ranching and farming have to be integrated in the long-term conservation strategies. So I appreciate the work that your colleagues did in southern Arizona in helping us get that plan done, and I thank you for your testimony. And we will invite the next panel up. [Pause] Mr. Grijalva. Welcome. Thank you for your patience, and we are looking forward to it. Rachael Mondragon, owner, Urban Interface Solutions, Taos, New Mexico. As part of the introduction--you were already introduced by our colleague, Mr. Lujan--my wife is from Penasco, up there north, and while she enjoys living in Arizona, she still considers us second class to northern New Mexico. So welcome, and we look forward to your testimony. STATMENTS OF RACHAEL MONDRAGON, OWNER, URBAN INTERFACE SOLUTIONS, TAOS, NEW MEXICO Ms. Mondragon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank you all for the opportunity to speak to you regarding something that I have had the good fortune to personally experience and be part of, the positive relationship between rural economics and forest health restoration. I decided to start my own business in . I knew that like every person out there who embarks on that journey, I was taking a huge leap of faith. The reason I pressed on was because I was convinced that not only could I make it in this industry, but that if I worked hard enough, I could build my business to a point that I could have several people working with me and be able to bid on larger projects. I wanted to take my business to the next level. When I started out, friends and family helped me, and I envisioned the day when I would be able to hire a crew and purchase the equipment that I needed to take on larger projects. That day came. I hired a crew. I began to purchase the equipment. My business was growing. And as much as I would like to tell you that hard work alone made all of this possible, I can't. I had help. The project that really opened the doors for me in my business were projects that I was able to implement on public lands. The contracts and programs that I was able to take advantage of provided me with the opportunities that I would never have had otherwise. These were the projects that introduced me to the power of partnership and collaboration. I met the people who would later become resources for future projects, and it was then that I understood that there are many organizations, groups, and individuals out there that are working together toward common goals, and they seem to want to help each other. They call and e-mail each other. They meet at project sites, and they support each other. You don't find that very often in the private sector, but when the Forest Service or the BLM provide an opportunity for these resources to work together, it seems to happen, and it seems to benefit everybody, including the Forest Service and BLM. A Forest Service CFRP grant awarded to the village of Questa allowed them to hire me as a contractor in . Thirty other workers were also hired for that project. In a village of , people, creating that many jobs for that many people is significant. To date, I still look on that project and consider it to be my big break. Grants through the Forest Service that provide funding for contractors like me to work on public lands made it possible to purchase equipment that would otherwise have taken years to acquire. The same equipment now makes me more competitive as a small business. I recently applied for and was awarded my own CFRP grant on the Carson National Forest. I now have the opportunity to create jobs for people in northern New Mexico for the next three years. And given the amount of work in the Urban Interface just in Taos County alone, I plan to keep this crew working for many years to come. This is sustainability, and that is what every business strives for. As a contractor, it is incredibly rewarding to be able to do that, not because it speaks to the success of my business or allows me to make more money with a bigger crew, but because I am creating jobs in my community. The work we are doing is rewarding. We are lowering the risk of wildfire next to a beautiful community. We are improving wildlife habitat. We are restoring health to a dense, overgrown forest. All of these are great accomplishments. But at a time when our economy is struggling to recover, and unemployment remains a concern nationally, it means the world to me that I am in a position to be part of the solution. Not only am I working, but so are several others who otherwise may not be. I am helping people to provide for their families. In closing, I would like to say that I have been very fortunate to have been involved in some of these projects on public lands. As a contractor, they have opened doors for me that once were closed. There are other business owners out there like myself who are not looking for easy money or handouts. They are looking for the opportunity to be part of something that will help them build capacity and provide for the future success of their businesses. Our public lands hold the key to many of those opportunities. By fostering strong relationships with land managers and reinforcing the value of these partnerships through successful, responsible project accomplishments, we all stand to gain something for generations to come. Again, I thank you for this opportunity to speak to you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Mondragon follows:] Statement of Rachael R. Mondragon, Urban Interface Solutions, Taos, New Mexico My name is Rachael Mondragon, and I am the owner of a small company in Taos, New Mexico called Urban Interface Solutions. I will be testifying on July , before the House Natural Resources Committee, Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands on, ``Locally Grown: Creating Rural Jobs with America's Public Lands.'' Background: With the exception of living in Wichita, Kansas for the first six months of my life, I am a life long resident of Taos. I attended public schools in Taos, and I graduated from Taos High School in . In , the country experienced catastrophic wildfires in many of the western states. At the time, I was working as a financial consultant for a national investment firm. It was then that I began to develop an interest in wildland fire. In , I left my job at the investment firm, and began taking courses that were offered locally by the Forest Service, BLM, BIA, and State Forestry. Once I completed the required courses to become a Wildland Firefighter, I signed up with the Carson National Forest's SWFF Program (Southwest Forest Firefighter). I went out as a crewmember on several crews, and had the opportunity to fight fire in several states, and in various fuel types. I developed a strong working knowledge of fire suppression tactics, fire behavior, tactical suppression operations, and a solid understanding of the Incident Command System used by the various interagency resources and Incident Command Teams. Later that same year, I took the S- Wildland Fire Chainsaw training, and became certified to operate a chainsaw on the fireline. That winter I attended the S- Helicopter Crewmember training so that I may begin working towards that qualification the following fire season. In , I took the S- Advanced Firefighter Training. I also took the S- Interagency Incident Business Management class, and decisively charted a course to make this a career. I applied for a position with the Red River Fire Department, and was hired as a sawyer on their thinning crew. I obtained my ``B faller'' certification, and worked daily with a highly skilled, and well trained thinning crew on various hazardous fuels reduction projects. While working on this crew, I maintained my wildfire qualifications, and responded to wildland fires with the crew. By my second year on the thinning crew, the Fire Chief promoted me to Crew Boss for demonstrating initiative, and leadership skills. I was then responsible for the program of work, scheduling, organization, mobilization and all logistical considerations for the entire crew on a daily basis. At this point, I was also working closely with the Asst. Fire Chief to perform more of the administrative tasks associated with the projects that we were implementing. I began to understand the grant process, and many of the fiduciary responsibilities associated with the administration of these grants. This was a pivotal point in my career. It was during my second year with the Red River Fire Department that I also began to look at the areas that we were treating more as ecosystems and landscapes, as opposed to ``properties that we were thinning.'' My background as a firefighter had allowed me to witness first hand the devastating effects that can and will occur when fire meets an unhealthy, overgrown, dense forest. We weren't just thinning trees, we were improving forest health. By doing so, our work also restored watersheds, improved wildlife habitat, reduced diseases in stands, and reduced the risk of catastrophic wildfire. The benefits of the work we were doing were countless. In , I sustained an injury while on a training exercise with the Red River Fire Department. I was unable to work for some time after the accident. It was during the time that I was recovering from my injury that I began the business plan for ``Urban Interface Solutions.'' In , I began my business, and it is the countless, positive, rewarding experiences to date, that I will be basing my testimony to this committee on. Socio-economic Benefits: When small businesses, or fledgling contractors can collaborate or enter into any type of partnership with any of the various land management agencies, everybody wins! Jobs are created, local economies thrive, and sustainability is made possible for contractors or small businesses. This is quantifiable, and my business is a textbook example of how these partnerships can benefit an entire region in ways that may not be apparent to those unfamiliar with the various programs and grants responsible for these successes. In , the Village of Questa, in Northern New Mexico applied for and received a CFRP (Collaborative Forest Restoration Program) grant. I, along with several other local contractors, was hired as a subcontractor to perform the thinning work. Not only were over jobs created locally, but also large quantities of firewood were processed and distributed to elderly people in the community through the local ``Ancianos'' Program. Local businesses benefited as a result of the contract crews working daily in the community. When the project was complete, acres had been thinned to prescription specifications, marking the beginning of the implementation of the Questa/Lama Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) project, a , acre project planned by the Questa Ranger District of the Carson National Forest, adjacent to the area that in was ravaged by the ``Hondo Fire'', forcing the evacuation of three communities, and destroying several homes. The accomplishment of these critical acres cost the Forest Service little more than some technical and administrative support (maps, layout, site visits, etc.). For those unfamiliar with the CFRP Program, it was established in , and is unique to the State of New Mexico. It provides cost-share grants to stakeholders for forest restoration projects on public land designed through a collaborative process. ``Within its legislative authority, the Act provides Federal appropriations of up to $ million annually towards cost share grants to stakeholders for experimental forest restoration projects designed through a collaborative process. These projects may be entirely on, or any combination of, Federal, Tribal, State, County or municipal forest lands and must include a diverse and balanced group of stakeholders in their design and implementation. Each project must also address specific restoration objectives, including: wildfire threat reduction; reestablishment of historic fire regimes; reforestation; preservation of old and large trees; and increased utilization of small diameter trees. Projects must also include a multiparty assessment and efforts to create local forest-related employment or training opportunities.'' This program helps small businesses. Not just by giving them a project to work on for a while to earn money, but also by helping them purchase equipment, provide crucial trainings for employees, increase and enhance their workforce, and develop the necessary experience to become and remain competitive in their respective industry. Sustainability, in the truest sense of the word. This program helps rural communities. The emphasis this program places on core value objectives ensures benefits to the surrounding community. It requires applicants to include an education component, and a youth component. Schools and Boy Scout Troops become involved in these projects. Small diameter forest product utilization is required and monitored. Socio-economic monitoring reports are required periodically throughout the project, quantifying the number of jobs created, and revenue being generated by the project. The socio-economic benefits of this program are undeniable. Coupled with the biological benefits of restoration, CFRP has been a success. That success is leading to expansion and adaptation. I have recently learned of a new program of the Forest Service that seems to be modeled on the CFRP. This national program, the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP), has many of the same components that the CFRP has. Like the CFRP, the CFLRP requires the organizations that want to do restoration on federal land to collaborate with others in their community, to the extent that preference is given to projects that span ownerships. Like CFRP, CFLRP projects are evaluated by a panel; the first CFLRP panel will meet next week in Washington. The biggest differences are the CFLRP targets large landscapes--greater than , acres--with a strong emphasis on Forest Service land, and not just in New Mexico but anywhere in the US. The similarities are so great that people in New Mexico that are familiar with the CFLRP call it ``CFRP on steroids.'' I trust it will be as successful as the CFRP. Forest Health Benefits: Each year Federal land managers spend a considerable amount of time and money to plan projects that once approved, they may not have the time, money, or resources to implement. This is a reality of declining budgets, reductions in workforce, or possibility shifting priorities. Allowing contractors to work with our land managers through programs like the CFRP program, enables the work to get done sooner than it would have otherwise. Project oversight is still provided by the agency, so quality work is assured. As with any other contract, the scope of work is clearly outlined, and the contract is administered by agency personnel. There are multiple benefits associated with this method of implementing these projects. The most notable is the fact that land managers are able to move forward with implementation of their projects before NEPA gets stale, and collectively we move towards improving forest health one project at a time. On July , , I met with Kendall Clark (Forest Supervisor, Carson National Forest) to discuss the CFRP projects that have been implemented on her forest, as well as her thoughts on the connection between rural economics, and the principal land management agencies in those areas. She felt that the CFRP Program created ``capacity'' that would otherwise not exist for implementing these projects in the region. She also felt strongly about agencies creating opportunities through collaboration with rural resources that would both meet the needs of the agency, and provide contract and job opportunities in these communities. Partnerships and Collaboration: Any program, project or process that allows multiple parties to combine resources and ideas, has a greater chance of success than any one entity working independently to accomplish the same goal. My personal experience as a business owner is that the measure of success comes not with high profits, but with the quality of work that is produced. High quality work is easier to accomplish when you have the proper mix of skill sets involved. Often times that means collaboration and partnerships with others who share a common goal. Fortunately for businesses like mine, there are many local groups and organizations who share the same desire to see quality work being performed on the ground, by people who care about the land. I feel that the resources available to me locally have played a significant role in the success of my business. In turn, I feel that they are able to consult with me and request assistance when they need it. The result is a strong, mutually beneficial working relationship, and the benefactor of this cohesiveness is the project or client. The following are groups or organizations who I have had the pleasure of working with in various capacities on local projects. These are the people who contribute to the tremendous success of local projects, and actively seek out partnership opportunities to better serve the people of the Southwest Region: New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute (NMFWRI): ``The New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute (NMFWRI), which is located at New Mexico Highlands University, is a statewide effort that engages government agencies, academic and research institutions, land managers, and the interested public in the areas of forest and watershed management. The New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute is one of three Institutes formed by the Federal Southwest Forest Health and Wildfire Prevention Act of . Their partner institutions are the ecological Restoration Institute, located at Northern Arizona University, and the Colorado Forest Restoration Institute, located at Colorado State University.'' Kent Reid and his staff have been instrumental in promoting training and supporting businesses like mine on several projects over the past few years. They have sent trainers and instructors out to project sites, and have supported my efforts both directly, and indirectly. Having resources like these available to businesses like mine can make the difference between success and failure for a business. It is a perfect example of why collaboration and partnerships are such an important part of land management. Rocky Mountain Youth Corps: ``Rocky Mountain Youth Corps (RMYC) was created in to revitalize community, preserve and restore the environment, prepare young people for responsible and productive lives, and build civic spirit through service. Modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 's, RMYC provides creative approaches to problems stemming from poverty, youth substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and violence. RMYC works with youth from various backgrounds, providing a strategy for young adults to better their communities and their own lives. With this in mind, they not only work to restore trails, watersheds, and fire safety corridors, they also use these activities as the means to positive youth development. RMYC has hired more than , Taos youth, between the ages of - , providing them with employment readiness programs, violence and substance abuse prevention education, GED attainment, and continuing educational scholarships. These youth have completed over , hours of meaningful community service that have benefited hundreds of school children, low-income families, elderly citizens, local government and non-profit agencies, and users of public land in Taos. RMYC members become heroes and heroines in the community, transforming negative images of youth into success stories about youth making a difference. By providing a safe, structured environment for learning that promotes citizenship, RMYC builds stronger communities in northern New Mexico.'' Local Culture: In rural communities such as those found in Northern New Mexico, you will not find big, industrial or commercial operations working on forestry projects. With all due respect to the big operations found in the Northwest, and in other parts of the country, many areas in the Southwest don't lend themselves well to the heavy equipment and industrial machinery used in areas where commercial timber is harvested by the millions of board feet. The successful projects that I have been involved in were smaller, more manageable projects. The work was done by groups like the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps, Boy Scout Troops working with volunteers, and small contractors like myself. The end result was a completed project with attention to detail, and aesthetics. Having a sense of ownership in the area, the same local contractors who performed the work take great pride in the finished product. Many of the local contractors have families that date back several generations in these rural areas. To them, it isn't just about cutting trees, and making money. It epitomizes the term ``caring for the land''. These are families that belong or once belonged to land grants, ranchers and farmers who were raised here, and families who have hunted, fished and camped on these public lands for generations. When I met with Kendall Clark on July , she commented on the value of sharing the stewardship of our public lands with those who have a personal connection to the land. Room for Improvement: As with any program, there is always room for improvement. The concept is great, but it is not without its flaws. As I have spoken to my peers in preparation for this hearing, two topics seem to surface repeatedly. The first is the evaluation and selection process. Granted, if it was easy to get through this process, everybody would be submitting applications. I understand that it has to be a stringent process, but it does seem that it has become more of a technical review with subject matter experts dissecting specific language in the proposal, rather than an objective evaluation of a proposal that may have merit with a few changes. I realize that every applicant thinks that their project should be funded, and that it is a great project. My comments are directed more towards applicants who have a great idea for a project, but that may not be able to afford a grant writer, or be able to articulate their idea in a manner that allows them to be competitive in the selection process. There is a growing perception that the CFRP Program is developing into a ``battle of the grant writers''. Maybe there is a way to level the playing field for those who are more comfortable behind a chainsaw than a computer. The second issue that surfaced repeatedly was the administration or oversight provided by the agency to the contractor. Several contractors mentioned that there is no formal opportunity to provide feedback relative to how they feel they were treated as contractors. In true collaboration there should never be a ``take it or leave it'' relationship. Most contractors are acting in good faith, and deserve the opportunity to not only provide feedback, but to have that feedback heard, and acted upon in the interest of improving the program. Agency officials should be responsive to contractors, and accept feedback positively and productively as it was intended. It could potentially lead to changes that create efficiencies in how the projects are implemented. The last item was shared with me by Kendall Clark, who felt that two phases of funding in the grant process may allow for some monies to be used for the planning of the proposed project, with a second phase to be used for implementation. I would offer that a third phase could be planned for follow up or ``maintenance'' treatment several years later. This would ensure that the effectiveness of the initial treatment could be restored in the future. I respectfully ask that consideration be given to my testimony, as it is intended to provide the members of this committee with possibly a different prospective than they may have previously had. There are many like me who take great pride in the work that they do, and consider it an honor to be a part of any effort that moves us closer to healthier forests, and helps our land managers reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire. Partnerships, collaboration and programs like the CFRP and CFRLP are instrumental in making that possible. Thank you. ______ Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. Ms. Kristin Troy, Executive Director, Lemhi Regional Land Trust, Salmon, Idaho. Welcome, and thank you. STATEMENT OF KRISTIN TROY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LEMHI REGIONAL LAND TRUST, SALMON, IDAHO Ms. Troy. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for this invitation and the opportunity to share with you how the management of Federal land in my community is potentially retaining several generations of jobs, and is creating jobs in the process as well. My name is Kristin Troy, and I am the Executive Director of Lemhi Regional Land Trust, which was started by ranchers, and is based in Salmon, Idaho. Salmon is also one of the most rugged--or excuse me, remote communities in the lower , and it is also one of the most rugged. We are flanked to the west by the Frank Church Wilderness, and to the east by the Continental Divide. Our county has about million acres; percent of those acres are publicly owned. And the cattle outnumber us by about seven to one. Given that ratio of public-to-private land, our ranchers depend heavily on public lands for grazing. And ranching currently is one of our few natural resource industries to survive. And we know about challenges and survival in my county because as I grew up there, I watched as our timber mills closed down, as did our mines. And what I now know is that once that infrastructure and skilled labor is gone, starting over gets complicated and expensive. It is not unlike the decline of a species. Once you become threatened and endangered, you become complicated and expensive. There is opportunity in all of this, though, and my organization embraces the idea that conservation and economic needs can in fact be compatible. And this is what I do. I work at the intersection of working lands and endangered species, and together with willing landowners and Federal partners, we are finding ways to keep our working lands working, while at the same time conserving land and water for the endangered Chinook salmon and Steelhead trout that make a , mile round-trip journey from Salmon, Idaho to the Pacific Ocean, and back again. One of the groups we are working with is the Upper Salmon Basin Watershed Project that was started as a collaborative by ranchers in the early ' s. This group helps to prioritize projects that benefit fish, and they carefully consider both the ecological and social aspects of the project. One of the sources of fish funding for these projects is Bonneville Power Administration. And what works in that particular program is that we have a state point agency that helps to manage those funds. It is the Office of Species Conservation. And as the Governor's representative, they are really motivated to help craft projects that have community support and recognize the good return on investment by allowing for project implementation and administration costs. That is incredibly important in my world, and it is all too rare. We are working on a large-scale land conservation project right now that has over $ . million designated to it, and $ , has been designated for hours of staff time necessary to make the project work on the ground. And that money allowed me to hire my first time local part-time employee. We have also utilized the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, and that was used to conserve a multi-family, multi-generation parcel of a ranch right at the base of the Continental Divide, by the way--really beautiful--and it gave that family an option to keep the ranch viable instead of subdividing. While that is a really well-intentioned program, and we are really happy to use it, it does have a very steep cash match, or a steep match, I should say. It is a percent cost share program; percent of that needs to be cold, hard cash. And there is no mechanism in there for implementation or on-the- ground staff time. And while the land trust focus has been primarily on conserving private lands, a forestry collaborative in my community is working to achieve the same balance on public lands. They are trying to get past nearly two decades of gridlock on the Salmon-Challis National Forest, and they are focusing heavily now on forest health and local economic benefit. In fact, their first -acre Hughes Creek project has pumped $ , into our community, with percent of that going directly to Lemhi County workers. So I guess this story is meant to portray a few things. First of all, collaborative efforts and community-based organizations have a pretty unique ability to set politics aside and to focus on our landscapes, and to get our good work done. And like it or not, through this process, we really get to know one another, and we learn to trust one another, and that is what is working. But please hear me when I say that community-based organizations are not seeking to become another arm of the Federal Government. We are valuable because we are small, nimble, efficient, and we are tied to the land. I hope that Federal agencies can recognize us as valuable partners to get the work done in a really meaningful way. So thank you for this invitation and opportunity. I hope this has been helpful, and I am happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Troy follows:] Statement of Kristin Troy, Executive Director, Lemhi Regional Land Trust Good Morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: Thank you for this opportunity to share with you how the management of federal and private lands is retaining and creating jobs in my community. My name is Kristin Troy and I serve as the executive director of the Lemhi Regional Land Trust, a non-profit organization that was founded by ranchers and is based in Salmon, Idaho. Salmon is one of the most remote communities in the lower , and it is also one of the most rugged. We are flanked to the West by the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness and to the East by the Continental Divide. Context: Around percent of Lemhi County is in public hands and managed by United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The remaining percent of private lands are, as one would expect, situated in the valley bottoms along the Salmon and Lemhi Rivers. Given the small amount of private land we have in our valley, ranchers depend heavily on access to these public lands for grazing. Ranching is one of the few natural resource based industries in our community that has survived. But that survival is tenuous at best for a variety of reasons - aging landowners, the rising cost of doing business, and pressure to subdivide. I grew up in Salmon and in my lifetime, I watched as the mainstay timber and mining industries dried up and blew away. The lost jobs meant lost tax revenue, lost families, a drop in school enrollment, and an increase in despair. As with many other rural communities across the West, we are committed to finding solutions that will maintain working landscapes, blurring the line between public and private lands in light of overall conservation objectives. We know from the loss of our timber industry that once the infrastructure and skilled labor is gone starting over is complicated and expensive. In a way, the decline of a rural economic sector is not so different from the decline of a species. By the time you are threatened and endangered, you are complicated and expensive. The opportunity: Rural communities are the front line stewards of our public lands. My organization embraces the idea that meeting our conservation and economic needs can be compatible. This is what I do - I work at the intersection of working ranch lands and endangered species and together with willing landowners and federal partners, we are looking for and finding ways to keep our working lands working while at the same time achieve conservation goals. The community is behind our efforts to conserve our working lands and our rural lifestyle for social and economic reasons, but the outcomes have impressive ecological implications as well. Although most of our county is public land, adjacent private lands harbor some of the richest wildlife habitat, including some of the most important habitat in the West for Chinook salmon and steelhead trout. These fish have traveled to the ocean and back - a round trip of about , miles - for thousands of years. Salmon were the staple for the Lemhi-Shoshoni tribe who inhabited the valley when Lewis and Clark came through the area, and salmon fishing continued to be part of the traditional way of life for ranching families who were early settlers. Today, dozens of landowners in this valley are voluntarily working with federal and state agencies and community-based organizations like Lemhi Regional Land Trust to make sure that when the wild salmon and steelhead return, they recognize home. Three project examples: In this context, I'd like to share some of my community's experiences with federal programs intended to motivate private landowners to conserve land for the benefit of threatened and endangered species, and the multitude of other wildlife that rely on intact pieces of land to thrive. Upper Salmon Basin Watershed Project Lemhi Regional Land Trust is one of the organizations participating in a collaborative group called the Upper Salmon Basin Watershed Project. The group works together to prioritize projects meant to enhance this critical fishery. Members include fish biologists, ranchers, conservationists, agencies, and tourism industry representatives, just to name a few. The group's recommendations put a powerful stamp of approval on proposals and let potential funders know that both ecological and social aspects of the plan have been carefully and thoughtfully considered. One of these funders is the Bonneville Power Administration. Bonneville Power mitigates the impacts of the massive hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River system, allocating revenue to fund the Pacific Coast Salmon Recovery Fund, established by Congress in to protect, restore, and conserve Pacific salmon and steelhead populations and their habitats. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manages the program that provides competitive funding to states and tribes of the Pacific Coast region, including Idaho. We have successfully used some of this funding to help conserve private working lands adjacent to the Lemhi River. I would like to make a few comments about what worked with this federal program: When the funding is awarded to the eligible states, there is a state contact and in Idaho's case, this is the Office of Species Conservation. As the Governor's representative on these issues, the Office of Species Conservation is highly motivated to make sure projects have community support. Federal agencies with far away offices and staff might not share this same sensitivity. The Office of Species Conservation also manages other sources of federal funding, such as the Snake River Basin Adjudication Habitat Trust Fund, which allow funds to be used for project administration and implementation costs. This is incredibly important, and all too rare. We are currently working on a project to conserve land and water on two separate ranches located on valuable tributaries to the Lemhi River. Between three different funding sources, all public money, over $ . million dollars has been designated for this project and $ , for the hours of staff time necessary to make such a project work on the ground. Additional funds for long-term monitoring were allowed to make sure project benefits continue to be realized over time. In this example, the $ . million would not have gotten to the ground (or to the river) without the allowance of $ , in implementation funding. Saving Carmen Creek Ranch Another project involved the Natural Resources Conservation Service Farm and Ranchland Protection Program. In partnership with the Nature Conservancy, we used this program to purchase a conservation easement on a -acre parcel that is part of a multi-family, multi-generational ranch along Carmen Creek, an important fish-bearing tributary to the Salmon River just miles from town. As one of the most scenic properties in the valley, the land was getting serious and focused attention from real estate developers. The three brothers who are the principals of Carmen Land and Livestock knew they valued the land for its productivity, its scenic qualities, and its undeniable importance to fish, birds, and other wildlife. The Farm and Ranchland Protection Program gave the brothers another option to keep their ranch viable other than subdividing. The Farm and Ranchland Protection Program was vital in the preservation of not only the acres along Carmen Creek, but also for the intact working ranch that will now endure for generations to come. However, Lemhi Regional Land Trust will only approach this funding source again with caution, because the significant costs for implementing the project cannot be recovered through the program itself (and the cash match requirement puts this well-intentioned program beyond the reach of many of the most vulnerable farmers and ranchers). This is one of the many federal programs targeted at communities like ours that lacks funding for implementation. This project, and so many others like it, could not have been accomplished without a community- based organization. \ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Community-based Organizations: Strategic Assets for Western Conservation. April . Sustainable Northwest. http:// www.sustainablenorthwest.org/resources/rvcc-issue-papers/ -issue- papers/Community-based% Orgs% Final.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lemhi County Forest Restoration Group While Lemhi Regional Land Trust's focus is mostly on conserving private lands in the valley, a partner organization is working to achieve this same balance on our public lands. Salmon Valley Stewardship and the Lemhi County Forest Restoration Group are working to get past nearly two decades of gridlock on the Salmon-Challis National Forest, a forest that lately has retained more outside attorney jobs than community forest practitioner jobs. The Lemhi County Forest Restoration Group is successfully building social agreement around the dual concepts of forest health improvement and local economic benefit. The group is carefully tracking jobs and revenue created by their first , -acre Hughes Creek project. Last I knew, even before the first commercial stick of wood has been cut, the project has put $ , into the local community, with more than percent going to Lemhi County workers. Because the Lemhi County Forest Restoration Group has placed importance on local economic benefit, they carefully monitor the project to ensure this benefit is realized. Surprisingly, few federal agencies--although endowed with millions of dollars--can report the same. The diverse group is working hard to bring additional dollars to forest restoration work. The collaborative's coordination activities and support staff is completely funded by private philanthropies. The group's members have been successful in raising money and using volunteers to help implement their projects, but these funds and volunteer hours are not guaranteed, and therefore keep the successful efforts of these organizations in an ever tenuous financial state. Although leveraging funding and human resources seems to be the best hope for the Forest Service's future, the agency is willing but woefully unequipped to manage grants and agreements with community- based organizations. The Salmon-Challis National Forest shares one grants and agreement employee with two other national forests and her desk is miles away. Because they are understaffed, agreements can easily take four months or longer to put into place, creating frustration and sometimes jeopardizing the funding the partner group brings to the table. The solutions: Public and private partnerships, as well as groups of diverse stakeholders working together to solve economic and environmental challenges, is the only way we can move forward with innovative solutions that will create pathways to prosperity and address our nation's conservation challenges. Federal programs and the land management agencies need to better organize their business operations to be effective partners to rural community-based organizations, to fully utilize the federal programs that are currently in place, and to be truly effective and sustainable over time. For example, the time and resources it took to see our Farm and Ranchlands Protection proposal for the Carmen Creek easement from start to finish, as well as meet the monitoring requirements, far exceeded the amount of the grant or my organizations ability to raise funds from other sources; the program does not make good business sense. Federal programs need to recognize that getting money to the ground takes time, energy, and a degree of trust. Community-based organizations are often in the best position to offer these resources and in many cases can amplify the effect through public outreach, volunteer support, or leveraged funding. Some programs require a percent match with half of that needing to be cold, hard cash. Flexibility that recognizes the value of in-kind match would remove significant barriers to these funding sources. Collaborative efforts and community-based organizations have a unique ability to put politics aside and focus on these incredible landscapes. As we work together to find solutions, we get to know and trust one another. Going out on the range with a rancher or walking in the woods with a forester, you get a chance to hear the wisdom that comes from working and living on the land. Involving relevant members of the community in these important discussions as equals adds an element of respect that is too often missing outside the collaborative process. In Lemhi County and all over the West, we are motivated to create a balance between our environment and our livelihoods. When we figure out how to keep enough water in the streams for fish but still allow the rancher enough to irrigate his hay while providing an option other than subdividing, we know we have succeeded in achieving this balance. We have retained not just a few jobs, but potentially several generations of jobs, and the vibrancy of our small towns. Community-based organizations are not seeking to become yet another arm of the federal government. We are valuable because we are small, nimble, efficient, and tied to the land. My hope is that federal agencies can be enabled to recognize the importance of partners who are willing and able to get federal dollars on the ground in the most meaningful way possible. Recommendations: . Make grant programs, such as the Farm and Ranchland Protection program, more effective by making them more flexible. . Match requirements for federal grants should take into consideration the economic context of the grantee--public land communities are high in poverty and unemployment, raising private match in this context is a serious challenge. . Integrate funding to support long-term monitoring to be performed by community-based organizations or other entities to ensure the long-term objectives of projects can be successful. . Recognize that increasing partnerships and collaborative efforts enhances the agencies' capacity. . Continue to support and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Forest Landscape Restoration Act, which hold great potential for communities such as mine. Thank you for the invitation and opportunity to meet with you today. It is my hope that this testimony has been helpful and I am happy to answer any questions. ______ Mr. Grijalva. Thank you very much. Melanie Parker, Executive Director, Northwest Connections, Swan Valley, Montana. Welcome, and I look forward to your testimony. STATEMENT OF MELANIE PARKER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NORTHWEST CONNECTIONS, SWAN VALLEY, MONTANA Ms. Parker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for inviting me here today to share my experience from Montana's Swan Valley. My name is Melanie Parker. I am the Executive Director of Northwest Connections. We are a not-for-profit business that hires and involves local people in citizen science. We engage in restoration. We lead collaborative planning efforts. We teach field ecology courses actually to young conservation professionals from all over the country. I also help my husband operate a traditional hunting and guide service and manage our small private forest land. I am a mom, and I am the chair of the local school board. The unifying concept really at the end of the day that I came here to talk about more than anything else in my written testimony is the value to this country of conserving working landscapes. I really believe strongly that Congress and this Administration need to focus both their conservation efforts and their job creation strategies on investment in working landscapes. So what are working landscapes? They are vast areas outside of designated parks and outside of wildernesses that still have high biological values. They are private lands and they are public lands. And they provide food, fiber, clean water, and wildlife habitat. They are lands that support the lives and the livelihoods of rural farms, rural ranches, and rural forest communities. They are lands on which millions of Americans rediscover the great outdoors: camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, biking, climbing. Working landscapes are not parks, and they are not sacrifice zones. They represent in fact the next great challenge in conservation across the West. And that is to say, how do we use land and take care of it? It is also a concept, this working landscape concept, that resonates quite deeply in rural communities. The Swan Valley, where I live, is one such working landscape, a vast area of checkerboard land ownership that stretches between two great wilderness areas to the south of Glacier National Park. Our working landscape has been threatened by two main factors, the divestment of our corporate land base into real estate development, and the shutdown of active management on our public lands. We are struggling to keep the land in landscape and the work in working. So there are three keys to our success that I pulled from my written testimony that I wanted to underscore right now. The first really is to communities like ours that are facing this divestment issue and the fragmentation in the real estate development. I really hope that this Subcommittee does support full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. And in addition, I will tell you that what really helps working landscapes in the West--and it has occurred in some places--is to use those funds not necessarily just for straight-up acquisition, but for easement projects. That has happened in my state. And if you could encourage that flexibility and that tool, I think that would even improve it. Second, we need programs that invest in--you know, I guess I should back up and say--you probably saw this in my written testimony, but the way that we have utilized tools like that, right now, we are celebrating the conservation of , acres of former Plum Creek land in western Montana, and that is all the remaining corporate timberlands in my valley. So that is why I am kind of passionate about that one. The second is the investment in programs that fund restoration and stewardship for a long enough duration that our business owners can make those investments, and also programs that are rewarding the kinds of collaboration that our communities are bringing to the table. So most notably right now, the collaborative forest landscape restoration program. Our community, along with communities in the Blackfoot and the Seeley Lake area just submitted a proposal that will cover-- that will fund for years, right, our partners, our Federal partners, $ million a year for years if we are successful. That is a big plus for our small businesses to be able to invest. And so those kinds of programs, I think, are really important. So I want to support full funding for CFLRP, but mostly I want to say it could be a template for other kinds of strategic investments. Last, I want to underscore what others have said about the value of our community-based organizations. In the Swan Valley, the very first building block to economic success has come from pulling various stakeholders together to forge common ground because without the social agreement on what constitutes land stewardship in our specific site, we quickly get locked up in contentious appeals and litigation. We as citizens have formed organizations that have built the capacity to build that social agreement and partner with all our agencies and interest groups, but there are no Federal programs, or very few at least, that support community-based organizations. So we would really encourage that. And just before I conclude, I would like to say I was thinking just as I was sitting back here that, actually, legislative tools that integrate those three things all in one place would actually really help us so that we are not chasing different things. OK. So in conclusion, I hope that as you have listened to my testimony and those of my fellow panelists, you realize that we actually represent something very important. We are new voices. We are not the voices of industry, and we are not the voices of environmentalism. We are the third way. We are rapidly becoming the new way of doing business in the West. And now we are formalizing new networks that are more regional in nature. We are organizing. We are aggregating because we know something deep in our hearts. We know that land and people are inextricably linked, and that our country--and that as a country we have to figure out how to protect resources and use them responsible. We are in it for the long haul. We hope you will partner with us. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Parker follows:] Statement of Melanie Parker, Executive Director, Northwest Connections Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for inviting me here today to share my experience from Montana's Swan Valley. My name is Melanie Parker and I live and work in a rural, forested valley in Western Montana. My husband has owned and operated a traditional hunting and guide service there for years. My own background is in ecology and education. Together he and I formed Northwest Connections, a not-for-profit business that conducts citizen science, engages in restoration projects, leads collaborative planning efforts, and teaches field ecology courses to young conservation professionals from around the country. The Swan Valley is situated between two wilderness areas about miles south of Glacier National Park. The valley is home to grizzly bears, wolves, lynx, bull trout and many other threatened and sensitive wildlife species. This richness is in no small part due to the wetlands that are strung across the valley bottom. The culture of the Swan Valley is tied directly to the abundant natural resources. Logging and log home building, along with outfitting and other outdoor related businesses characterize the economy. Historically, the community had very close ties to the Forest Service, as the ranger station was located in the small town of Condon, but years ago that ranger station was closed as districts were consolidated and now all of the Forest Service personnel who administer the Swan Valley live and raise their families in the Kalispell area miles to the north. Life in the Swan Valley has been dominated by the checkerboard land ownership pattern. As a result of the railroad land grants of , nearly every other square mile has been owned and managed by corporate timber interests. In the mid- 's, roads were improved enough in the Swan Valley to make commercial timber harvest viable. While it was the Forest Service who was most active in the middle part of the last century, it was Burlington Northern, later Plum Creek Timber Co., that extracted the bulk of the timber in the 's and 's. Environmental concerns about the cumulative effects to the watershed, as well as a swell of environmentalism nationally, all but shut down activity on federal lands in the Swan Valley. This resulted in a landscape that we began describing in the late 's as the land of ``too much and not enough'' as nearly every acre suffered from either too much disturbance from road building and logging, or too little disturbance from the suppression of fire and the shutdown of active management. If the diminished Forest Service presence and the accelerated harvest of corporate lands were not enough, just over ten years ago we began to face a new challenge: corporate timber lands increasingly put on the real estate market and sold off for development. All of these challenges have driven our community to organize, to define our own vision of rural prosperity, and to develop strong partnerships with governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations to realize that vision. The dramatic success for which the Swan Valley is gaining notoriety at present, is our project to stem the tide of real estate development. After a decade of hard effort, we are celebrating the conservation of , acres of Plum Creek Timber Co. land in Western Montana including all of the remaining corporate lands in the Swan Valley. We succeeded at building partnerships between local and national groups, and at putting together federal, state and private funding sources to secure these lands. There are a lot of reasons this project has met with success, but I would like to highlight perhaps the most important and least visible reason. In rural communities all across the west we are speaking a new language. It is a language that has profound new meaning, and it is not the language of the past. We are talking more and more about the conservation of working landscapes. The conservation of working landscapes is something that resonates very deeply with rural communities and that vision is what has allowed us to garner such widespread political support for this Plum Creek lands project. What are working landscapes? They are vast areas outside of designated parks and wilderness areas that have high biological values. They are private lands and public lands that provide food, fiber, clean water, and wildlife habitat. They are lands that support the lives and livelihoods of rural farms, rural ranches and rural forest communities. They are lands on which millions of Americans rediscover the great outdoors: camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, biking, climbing. Working landscapes are not parks, and they are not sacrifice zones. They represent, in fact, the next great challenge in conservation across the West which is to say how do we use land and take care of it. When our community began struggling with the challenge of corporate timber land divestment, we did not know what the final outcome would be, but we did know that we wanted a working landscape, one where we could balance the use and care of the land. We had been weathering the boom and bust cycles for decades just like so many other rural communities across the West, the cycles that follow this country's alternating impulses to exploit or protect the resources of our region. Our community was not then, and is not now, interested in being the victim of this nation's polarizing wars on natural resource management; we are looking at every juncture for opportunities to chart our own destiny as leaders in a movement to prove that landscapes like the Swan Valley can provide good work, locally delivered resources and environmental stewardship. And so now, in , the Swan Valley finds itself in transition. The Trust for Public Land and The Nature Conservancy have worked with us to purchase and convey much of the former Plum Creek lands in the Swan Valley to the U.S. Forest Service. That is a dramatic conservation success of the first order. But our success will only be complete when we establish a long term program of stewardship work on those public lands. Our collaborative efforts in the Swan Valley have broken the gridlock on federal lands management and we have begun to see a few good projects employ local people, but our transition is tenuous at best right now. We have seen a steady erosion of economic vitality in recent years. The Swan Valley has roughly half the number of businesses it had years ago, and only one third the number of children enrolled in the local elementary school. Our ability to retain and create family wage jobs tied to public land management has never been so critical My testimony at this point divides into two segments. The first addresses the tools that are important to communities like ours to arrest the accelerating development of private lands that adjoin and are integrally connected to public lands across the West. These tools help communities secure the land base that support rural economic activity. The second segment addresses tools that can help us transition the old economies of extraction and protection into the new economy of stewardship. STEMMING DEVLEOPMENT PRESSURE The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is critical and I hope this congress supports full and permanent funding for the program. When Plum Creek put up their first ``higher and better use'' land sale in along the shores of Lindbergh Lake adjacent to the Mission Mountain Wilderness, the Trust for Public Land helped us secure LWCF dollars to acquire those acres and convey them to the Flathead National Forest. It continues to be an important program to our project and to many other landscapes and communities with which I am familiar. Congress should give direction to federal and state agencies to make LWCF more flexible for the purchase of conservation easements on private lands. In many public lands dominated communities there is a strong desire to retain valuable private landholdings, and for those areas an easement option is essential. In the Swan Valley, we have also made use of the Forest Legacy program as well as Habitat Conservation Plan programs to address development pressure and I see great value in maintaining and expanding those programs for western communities facing large scale land conversion issues. Rural communities like ours are also very interested developing new forms of land tenure. Because most of the forces that determine our fate are external and remote--whether the land base is federal, corporate, or state land--we are interested in programs that will help us acquire and manage community-owned lands. In the Swan Valley we have one such community conservation area which we are currently hoping to expand. Two programs will help communities like ours. The first, the Community Forest and Open Space Program provides funds to local governments and qualifying non-profit organization to purchase community lands. The second is the authorization of the Community Forestry Conservation Act, which would give communities the ability to issue bonds to purchase land and secure the bonds with future sustainable timber harvest. For the small private forest land owner who wants to stave off the temptation to sell or subdivide, we need to maintain programs like the Forest Stewardship Program within State and Private Forestry and the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program within NRCS. I have heard from several land owners that they would be more likely to use those programs if the matching requirement could be in the form of donated value, rather than cash. The cash match is simply too expensive for most traditional rural land owners. Investments in these kinds of programs are very strategic, and reduce costs to the American tax payer. I can tell you that the rural sprawl across every other square mile that we were facing in the Swan Valley would have meant huge increases in firefighting costs, as well as increased demands for wildlife recovery dollars. According to one Forest Service report if homes were built in only half of the private lands bordering public land the annual federal firefighting costs would range from $ . Billion to $ . Billion per year. Each of the programs I mentioned above help conserve working landscapes, curb future costs to the public, and secure the land base for rural economic activities. PROMOTING A LAND STEWARDSHIP ECONOMY In the Swan Valley, the first building block to economic success has come from pulling diverse stakeholders together to forge common ground. Without social agreement on what constitutes land stewardship in our specific site, we quickly get locked up in contentious appeals and litigation. There can be no economic stability for our community until all of the groups interested in our landscape can work hand in hand with state and federal agencies to chart a long term program of work. Federal programs that link federal investment dollars to successful collaboration are key. This past year, communities in the Swan Valley, in Seeley Lake and across the Blackfoot Valley have submitted a proposal to the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP). If we are successful, our federal agency partners will receive $ M/year for ten years to accomplish restoration work on public lands across . million acres. CFLRP is very good legislation that requires a broad coalition of interests to assess the landscape together, identify priorities and sketch out a plan for action in order to be successful. CFLRP should receive full funding for the next ten years. I should also be used as a template for other programs to invest in restoration and land stewardship across the west. Collaboration is the foundation for economic prosperity in the west, and yet it lacks support from federal agencies and from most federal programs. In many communities like the Swan Valley citizens have organized themselves into non-governmental organizations (NGO's) that have the capacity to partner with government agencies, private land owners and other associations and interests. Federal programs to support NGO partners, however, are few and far between. The National Forest Foundation has been an important support system for many community based organizations in our region, and congress should fully fund their appropriations, but we also need to look for other opportunities to invest in local and regional collaborative conservation efforts. Another key to success relates to the capacity of federal land managers to put the necessary staff time into collaborative conservation efforts. Right now federal employees have very few incentives to partner with our community organizations. Performance measures that put a value on collaboration in rural western communities need to be developed and strengthened. In the Swan Valley we have faced additional challenges related to the remoteness of our federal agency staff and by the turnover in key leadership positions. Federal agencies should recognize the value of keeping land management professionals in place over time. The resulting trust and understanding that is built between agencies, NGO's and rural residents sets the stage for successful design and implementation of land stewardship projects. Stewardship has become a key concept for us as it connotes both work on and care for the land. Stewardship contracting is one of the very best tools to come along in the past decade and it needs to be reauthorized and its use expanded across the West. In stewardship contracts, the government can choose the BEST contractor, not necessarily the one who delivers the highest dollar amount back to the government. This has really helped to incentivize our workforce to prove its capacity to do good work, not just fast work. We whole heartedly support the re-authorization of stewardship contracting and we hope to see the federal agencies use it as the dominant form of doing business. All of this said and done, we are still faced with a situation where the American people are asking agencies like the Forest Service to do stewardship, but the agencies are still funded through old categories like timber. We need a new integrated budget structure that incentivizes holistic integrated stewardship. This year the President's budget recommended the Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR) line item. I have talked to many on my district, my forest, and across Western Montana who think IRR has great promise, but they have fears that their particular special interest--timber, fire, wildlife--will lose funding. We need to hammer out the right guidelines for such an integrated budget structure, and that may take another year, but I do enthusiastically support such a budget structure reform and believe it will produce better projects that garner broader support. CONCLUSION In July I can report to you that we in the Swan Valley are making progress. We have built strong local and regional collaborations. Those diverse stakeholders have worked together to erase the checkerboard land ownership pattern and they have made strong progress in articulating goals for the restoration and stewardship of the entire landscape. Now we need federal agencies that are ready, willing and able to partner with us. And we need a firm commitment from congress to invest in the conservation and stewardship of working lands in our valley and all across the West. I hope that as you listen to the testimony of all my fellow panelists you realize that we represent something very important. We are new voices. We are not the voices of industry and we are not the voices of environmentalism. We are a third way and we are rapidly becoming the new way of doing business in the West. It may not be visible to you at this hearing, but many of us now know each other. We didn't used to, but we started bumping into one another, telling our stories, and realizing the parallels. Now we are formalizing new networks. My group, Northwest Connections, is a member of the Rural Voices for Conservation Coalition, convened by Sustainable Northwest. But for Sustainable Northwest's support, my voice and several others here would likely not be here today. Jim Stone's group the Blackfoot Challenge is also helping to coordinate a regional network known as the Partners for Conservation. We are organizing and we are aggregating, because we know something deep in our hearts. We know that land and people are inextricably linked and that until this country figures out how to protect resources and use them responsibly, we are sunk. We are in it for the long haul and we hope you will partner with us. Thank you. ______ Mr. Grijalva. Thank you very much. And just as a note, Ms. Parker, you need to be very careful. I started out as a school board member, and all your plans could go awry overnight. Ms. Mondragon, one of the things you mentioned and you talk about generations of families living off the lands in New Mexico, and there is a checkered history of Federal land management and the conflict between communities, history, land grants. And so how do national forests fit into that preservation of the way of life that has been there for generations and generations in New Mexico, and particularly in some parts of the north? Ms. Mondragon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, nationally, I can't really speak to how it would nationally. But I do know that, you know, in our area, it is very important to see and to have these lands that we can preserve. We can go out and we can thin. We help against wildland fire. We, you know, help preserve against some of the other diseases that the trees are now getting. And it really connects the community that for a long time--and still do; there are some areas that folks have a real hard time with because they feel that it is their land. They feel that, you know, my great grandfather owned that, and it was stolen from me, things of that nature. And so it really helps connect them back to the land and make them feel like it is still theirs, and they can help preserve it. They can help treat it so that it is healthier. I am not sure if that answers your question. OK. Thank you. Mr. Grijalva. In your written testimony, Ms. Troy, you mentioned saving the Carmen Creek Ranch. And it couldn't have been done, as you accurately pointed out, without community- based organizations. You started to talk a little bit about that. But what does an organization, community-based like yours, bring to the table to help facilitate that conservation effort? And we can use the Carmen Ranch as the example. Ms. Troy. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That particular program, we used the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, and within that program, one of the tools that we used for conservation in my community are conservation easements. Within Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, we are able to use conservation easements to protect the land on the ground that will then keep the land in private land ownership. What I think we were able to bring to the table is both capacity skills and the experience necessary to get what is a very complicated, long, perpetual document and agreement in place to create that land protection. Our local natural resources conservation service office is wonderful, but they don't have the kind of skills and experience to negotiate an agreement like that, I think, or the time really to do it. So that is what allowed that project really, I think, to get done. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. Ms. Parker, what could Federal land management agencies do to assist new businesses and workers in learning not just about restoration, but also the stewardship on public lands and the long-term commitment to the development of that relationship between the Federal land management and those surrounding communities? Ms. Parker. OK. Thank you for the question, Chairman. Mr. Grijalva. You know, your point about consolidating some of the legislative initiatives---- Ms. Parker. Yeah. Mr. Grijalva.--is a point well taken, and thank you. But-- -- Ms. Parker. Yeah. Mr. Grijalva. OK. Ms. Parker. And I hope I answer the question. Before I do, I want to acknowledge that I am actually a native of the great State of Arizona, so I am especially pleased to make your acquaintance. OK. Well, I guess I am going to break that into two things. First of all, I want to acknowledge that the learning goes two ways. It is not just Federal agencies sort of, you know, teaching the working contractors, which I know you know, but what we really appreciate and like is the kind of collaborative relationship where everybody standing around a circle, out in the winds, and we are learning from each other. And so I think just having--the Federal Government--just having a program of work where local contractors can access it over time creates that long-term relationship where that cross- learning is happening. B, another thing Federal agencies can do that will help that is just to keep their people in place over time to develop those relationships with local communities. One of our big obstacles, actually, is the bungee jumping of Federal employees through our rural community. And so that breaks down that long- term trust building. So the learning is important there. And then the third thing I just want to sort of throw in there, like Joyce, we also have quite a few youth volunteer corps programs that are scaffolding the next generation, not the people who are working right now, but the ones that are just behind them, into the programs where they are doing, you know, stream monitoring, wildlife monitoring, those kind of things. And our Youth Corps program is not like an SCA type program, where you are building trails. It is more a knowledge creation program. And so I would encourage Congress, as you are integrating with the Administration on the America Great Outdoors Initiative, to really look at some homespun youth corps programs in our rural communities, as well as the big national groups, because I think we are actually trying to promote our local youth into the workforce to stay there over time. Mr. Grijalva. And you answered my other question. Ms. Parker. Oh, good. Mr. Grijalva. Which was about youth. As a community-based organization having to bring diverse parties together for discussions--this is just my curiosity--do you find your role as an organization or as an individual leading that organization to be more of an arbiter of what is going on, or kind of more of a leader in a direction? Just a curiosity on my part? Ms. Parker. Who do you want to answer? Mr. Grijalva. Either one, all of you, in fact. Ms. Parker. You go first. Ms. Troy. Thanks. I think the short answer is it is certainly not always easy. But in our particular case, it is really important to understand that my organization was created by ranchers. So it is starting from the ground up. And the reason it is starting from the ground up is because there was a need for an organization like ours. We were seeing turnover of some of our really especially notable ranches in the community. And I think that really alarmed folks deep down, and, you know, really questioned whether our traditional way of life was going to stay intact. So for my organization, landowners come to us. We don't go knock on doors. So that is how it starts. And then because we are trying to with some of this endangered species funding, when they come to us as a local group, we basically sit down, and I tell them, OK, here is the deal. This is Federal money, and it has strings attached. There are specific conservation outcomes that need to happen if we are going to use this money. And then the next question they ask me is, well, can we keep ranching. And, you know, another complicated answer is, yes, probably. But we need to figure out how to do that in a way that is compatible, you know, with these conservation objectives. I think the next step is the really important one. I say, how do you think we can do that? And I think that is what is missing when we don't have a collaborative process in place. You miss that wisdom from the people who live and work on the ground, because, guess what, they have some of the best ideas about how to accomplish conservation on their particular ranch. So at that point, then it goes to this larger collaborative, and we try to figure out if those are compatible, those two--if the landowners' goals and the goals of the program are in fact compatible. So it is a lengthy process. Mr. Grijalva. Thank you. Anybody else? Ms. Parker. No. Mr. Grijalva. Well, I want to thank the panel, and in expressing my gratitude, tell you that, you know, some of us are very, very passionate about conservation and preservation. And unfortunately, the discussions become an either-or proposition. And so I welcome your testimony because in reality, it is not. But sometimes you are forced to put up the barracks because that is what the war has been about, either- or. And so your testimony today, we don't all have to jump in, that there is another way to create dialogue, painful as it is sometimes, compromise. And particularly, I like the point that you made about the working landscape of the West. And it is absolutely true. And so thank you very much. You know, sometimes our Federal land managers and our special places and public spaces are seen as job killers. They are seen as the enemy. And I don't believe that is true. We can revive many of the communities that you work with. But I think that also requires the Federal agencies, and the two departments, Interior and Agriculture in particular, to think outside the way they have been thinking about this for a long, long time. And as we begin to craft a response, not only to the Great Outdoors Initiative, reauthorizing the public school support, and reauthorizing other pieces of legislation, some of the input that we have had from people that are actually on the ground today is going to be very, very valuable. And so as we craft that legislation for the future, your input is going to be valuable, and it is going to be useful. So thank you very much. The meeting is adjourned.

ENHANCING AND IMPLEMENTING THE CYBERSECURITY ELEMENTS OF THE SECTOR- SPECIFIC PLANS ---------- Wednesday, October , U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology, joint with the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at : p.m., in Room , Cannon House Office Building, Hon. James R. Langevin [chairman of the Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology Subcommittee], presiding. Present: Representatives Langevin, Etheridge, Pascrell, Jackson Lee, Clarke, McCaul, and Lungren. Mr. Langevin. The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology, and the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection will now come to order. The subcommittees today are meeting to receive testimony on enhancing and implementing the cybersecurity elements of the sector-specific plans. I will begin by recognizing myself for the purpose of an opening statement. Good afternoon. Over the past few months, the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology has held numerous hearings to assess how far-reaching our cybersecurity vulnerabilities are and how best to address them. Today, we will be focusing on the extent to which cybersecurity has been implemented as part of our different sector- specific plans. We are joined today by the Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee led by Chairwoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and Ranking Member Lungren. Though this is our first joint hearing on the subject, I very much look forward to working with the chairwoman and ranking member, along with my ranking member on the subcommittee on these issues of the th Congress as it continues. Although critical infrastructure protection is usually associated with physical protection of facilities, there is a growing realization that cybersecurity must receive equal attention. This holds true especially since the Nation's critical infrastructure relies extensively on computerized information systems and electronic data. As we learned weeks ago in a hearing on control systems and the electricity grid, many elements of our Nation's critical infrastructure are vulnerable to cyber attack in part because the computers are connected to the Internet. A cyber attack against a portion of our critical infrastructure could have devastating consequences that could cascade across the country. Similarly, an attack on our control systems could cause serious physical harm, for example, through the introduction of raw sewage into drinking water systems or through the catastrophic failure of critical electrical generators. One of the most important ways we can secure our infrastructure is through the implementation of the sector- specific plans. These plans, one for each critical infrastructure sector in the U.S., are supposed to describe how each sector will identify, prioritize, and protect their physical and cyber assets. These plans are based on the high level of Federal guidance in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, or NIPP, released by DHS in . The NIPP is the roadmap for the sectors to follow when developing their sector-specific plans. The completion of the sector-specific plans will allow DHS to write a national annual report on critical infrastructure protection which is designed to give us a general assessment of the security of our infrastructure. This firsthand report is scheduled to be released next week. Today, we will focus specifically on the cyber aspects of these plans. I have two significant concerns about the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security in this area. First, according to the Government Accountability Office report, released today, many of the plans are incomplete when it comes to cybersecurity. The GAO rated these sector-specific plans according to three categories--either fully addressed, partially addressed, or not addressed at all--and found that none of the plans fully addressed all cybersecurity criteria. GAO reports many plans have no way of identifying the consequences of a cyber attack or reporting metrics of progress in implementing the plans to DHS. GAO concluded that without comprehensive plans, certain sectors could be ill prepared to respond to a cyber attack. Now, the plans are supposed to be the easier part of this process, but if we are struggling just to get the plans right, we are going to have an even tougher time achieving true security. Our main goal, of course, is actually protecting our critical infrastructure or at least making it resilient to attack; that should be the primary focus of our efforts. But as the first step, DHS must improve the current state of the cyber elements of the sector-specific plans. What we have now is simply unacceptable. My second concern is with the implementation of the plan. Today's sector witnesses will describe the varying degrees to which they have begun translating their plans into actual improvements. It should be noted, of course, that the sector- specific plans were officially released in May , so there has not been a great deal of time for action. While sectors have started implementing their plans, much work clearly remains to be done. Under the Department's current public-private partnership approach, I don't believe the Federal Government can adequately ensure the security of our critical infrastructure. Thus far, DHS has adopted a laissez-faire approach, it seems, towards critical infrastructure owners and operators. The sector- specific plan process is entirely voluntary and there are no regulatory requirements attached to it. Many would argue, however, that protecting critical infrastructure is an issue of national security, a core constitutional responsibility of the Federal Government. Under this viewpoint, laissez-faire is arguably not the appropriate model. This observation is not intended to be an argument for more regulation or a criticism of our private sector partners. In a perfect world, we either wouldn't have to worry about security or would have an unlimited amount of money to spend on it, but this is clearly not a perfect world. The Federal Government and the American people want to ensure that there is a high level of cybersecurity protections on our critical infrastructure. But, as Dr. Gordon notes in his testimony, private sector owners and operators have a hard time making the business case for increased cybersecurity investments. Recognizing there may, in fact, be a market failure when it comes to private sector cybersecurity, I have asked the second panel of witnesses to discuss ways to incentivize owners and operators of critical infrastructure to better protect their systems. Some believe that with the proper incentives, the private sector can respond faster and more efficiently to future threats. Clearly, without appropriate consideration of all available public policy tools, the private sector's participation in critical infrastructure efforts may not reach its full potential, but I do think we need to look at a broad range of options in this area. I have great apprehension, though, about the current framework DHS is creating with the sector-specific plans as they relate to cybersecurity. But I am hopeful that today's discussion will be a valuable tool in trying to strike the right balance that will ensure a high level of security with a low level of government involvement. Mr. Langevin. That concludes my opening statement, and the Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. McCaul, for an opening statement. Prepared Statement of the Honorable James R. Langevin, Chairman, Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science Good afternoon. Over the past few months, the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology has held numerous hearings to assess how far reaching our cybersecurity vulnerabilities are and how best to address them. Today we will be focusing on the extent to which cybersecurity has been implemented as part of our different Sector Specific Plans. We are joined today by the Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, led by Chairwoman Jackson-Lee and Ranking Member Lungren. Though this is our first joint hearing on the subject, I very much look forward to working with the Chairwoman and Ranking Member on these issues as the th Congress continues. Although critical infrastructure protection is usually associated with physical protection of facilities, there is a growing realization that cybersecurity must receive equal attention. This holds true especially since the nation's critical infrastructure relies extensively on computerized information systems and electronic data. As we learned two weeks ago in a hearing on control systems and the electricity grid, many elements of our nation's critical infrastructure are vulnerable to cyber attack in part because their computers are connected to the Internet. A cyber attack against a portion of our critical infrastructure could have devastating consequences that cascade across the country. Similarly, an attack on our control systems could cause serious physical harm, for example through the introduction of raw sewage into drinking water systems or through the catastrophic failure of critical electrical generators. One of the most important ways we can secure our infrastructure is through the implementation of the Sector Specific Plans. These plans----one for each critical infrastructure sector in the U.S.--are supposed to describe how each sector will identify, prioritize, and protect their physical and cyber assets. These Plans are based on the high level Federal guidance in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan--or NIPP--released by DHS in . The NIPP is the road map for the sectors to follow when developing their Sector Specific Plans. The completion of the Sector Specific Plans will allow DHS to write a National Annual Report on Critical Infrastructure Protection, which is designed to give us a general assessment of the security of our infrastructure. The first annual report is scheduled to be released next week. Today we will focus specifically on the cyber aspects of these plans. I have two significant concerns about the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security._First, according to the Government Accountability Office report released today, many of the plans are incomplete when it comes to cybersecurity. The GAO rated the Sector Specific Plans according to three categories: fully addressed, partially addressed, or not addressed, and found that none of the plans fully addressed all cybersecurity criteria_GAO reports that many plans have no way of identifying the consequences of a cyber attack or reporting metrics of progress in implementing the plans to DHS. GAO concluded that without comprehensive plans, certain sectors could be ill prepared to properly respond to a cyber attack. Now, the plans are supposed to be the easier part of this process. But if we're struggling just to get the plans right, we're going to have an even tougher time achieving true security. Our main goal, of course, it actually protecting our critical infrastructure, or at least making it resilient to attack. That should be the primary focus of our efforts, but, as a first step, DHS must improve the current state of the cyber elements of the sector specific plans. what we have now is simply unacceptable.

But I am hopeful that today's discussion will be a valuable tool in trying to strike the right balance that will ensure a high level of security with a low level of government involvement. Mr. McCaul. I thank the chairman, and Chairwoman Jackson Lee and Ranking Member Lungren. Let me first say how honored I was yesterday to announce with you the creation of a commission to study this issue of cybersecurity, which has the top and brightest minds in the country on cybersecurity participating. It will be chaired by Admiral Inman, who is a former Director of NSA, Deputy Director of CIA, a good friend of mine, one of the brightest individuals I think I have ever met; and Scott Charney, who I had the opportunity to work with at the Department of Justice, who headed up the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property section. I look forward to working with you in a bipartisan way. It is actually a nonpartisan commission that will provide recommendations for the next administration and the Congress on this very important issue. This hearing today will bring attention to the importance of protecting the Nation's critical information technology infrastructure. In response to the President's seventh Homeland Security Directive, the Department of Homeland Security has developed the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. It is designed to provide a coordinated approach to establish national priorities, goals, and requirements for all sectors of our economy that own and operate critical infrastructures across the country. Since every sector depends to a certain extent on IT systems and networks, it is very important that each sector's plan includes its approach to securing its information infrastructure. The sector-specific plans have undergone what some might call a tortuous evolution. Even so, it is important to realize that these plans are one piece of developing a common framework across the diverse sectors. What this subcommittee has discovered in its hearings is that each of the sectors is dependent upon information infrastructure in one way or another. Some are more dependent upon it than others, but each sector could be vulnerable to cyber threats and cyber attacks if appropriate steps are ignored. For example, a hacker could infiltrate the billing system of a hospital or retail store or affect credit numbers or health information for a vast number of individuals. This would inject the financial and/or health care system with uncertainty. Similarly, we learned earlier this month that industrial control systems could cause very real physical damage if not properly secured. We need to make sure that all the sectors are aware of their inherent interdependencies, and also that all sectors have critical information infrastructure, even if they don't think they do, that needs to be evaluated and appropriately secured. The sector-specific plans are the first step in securing this country's critical infrastructure. Again, Chairman Langevin and I--I was pleased to announce yesterday that we are participating in a commission to develop recommendations on cyber and information security policy for the next President. It is important to evaluate the actions of the current administration, build upon its successes, and incorporate its lessons learned as we move forward to improve our Nation's overall cybersecurity. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Langevin. I thank the gentleman. And the Chair now recognizes the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection, the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee, for an opening statement. And let me just again, as I mentioned in private to the chairwoman, say how grateful I am that we are doing this joint hearing and how much I certainly look forward to working with you, Madam Chair, as we go forward. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And let me offer my equal appreciation of the opportunity to continue a topic that my committee, Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection, along with the ranking member of that subcommittee, has continued to have a keen eye. And as I do so, might I just acknowledge the existence of the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. In meeting with a number of those from the private sector, we know that the work that we are doing today, the work that you have done, is extremely important and is an urgent topic of the private sector's participation in protecting our country's critical infrastructure. So, again, I am grateful to Chairman Langevin for inviting the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection to participate in this hearing; and I look forward to our future collaboration where our issues of concern interact. Today's hearing regards the implementation or existence of the cybersecurity elements of the sector-specific plans, SSPs, under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. Ranking Member Lungren and myself take particular interest in this topic as DHS protection falls under our subcommittee's jurisdiction. We have been and continue to be very vigilant about the Department's protection of our Nation's critical infrastructure, beyond cybersecurity to also address physical and human considerations. Thanks again to Chairman Langevin, however, we will learn today about how the Department is protecting critical infrastructure from a cybersecurity perspective, and I look forward to seeing how the lessons learned today apply to other critical infrastructure protection programs. Thus far, I have been disappointed with DHS SSP efforts, but I look forward to learning more today and continuing the journey so that we can work together public and private sector. SSP is a massive and unprecedented undertaking. According to the Homeland Security Act of , critical infrastructure includes systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of these matters. Based upon this definition, critical infrastructure is not just bridges and water utilities, but also financial centers and transactions. It is therefore clear that when such a vast and important mission is combined with a young agency, it is incumbent upon it and its oversight committee to have frank and honest discussions about the efficacy of our SSP efforts. Protecting our systems and assets from natural and human- made disasters is exclamated by the fact that approximately percent of the country's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. Furthermore, this administration did not encourage the government to regulate the private sector owners and operators, and for them, instead--to protect their critical infrastructure, but instead it encouraged voluntary partnerships. I raised the question earlier this morning about whether or not there needs to be regulation or should we continue in the voluntary effort. How well the Department manages this voluntary relationship with the private sector to protect our critical infrastructure is and will continue to be a major priority for our committee and my subcommittee specifically. Recently, Chairman Thompson and I directed committee staff to investigate the implementation of the NIPP and SSPs to learn whether they are motivating private industry to protect our critical infrastructure. Because such a large task is based upon a voluntary partnership, we need to give great attention to whether actions are indeed being taken. That will be the focus of my attention at today's hearings. And might I also say that I believe there is a great interest in the private sector to be engaged. They know that they have a large share of the private infrastructure or the infrastructure of this Nation. Then, what is the vehicle, what is the formula, what is the structure that should be utilized to engage the private sector and to make this work? After all, we are responsible for securing America collectively, and this committee, the full committee, knows full well the question will be asked, maybe only of this committee, if the possibility occurs of a terrorist act in this Nation. The release of the NIPP and SSPs was delayed significantly. Unfortunately, the threat to our critical infrastructure was not simultaneously delayed. As a result, we have to quickly determine whether these plans are being implemented by owners and operators to better protect our critical infrastructure. It is not enough to create large, nearly unreadable documents and to discuss processes. Instead, we must focus on implementation and execution. For instance, we must have effective and efficient communication between private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure at all levels of government. On September , Chairman Thompson and I sent a letter to Assistant Secretary Stephan and Director Caboli about the implementation of the SSPs and the standards of the national annual report that is supposed to describe the implementation of protection efforts. Based upon the Department's responses, we are quite concerned about whether verifiable action is being taken by the private sector. I am not here to reprimand the private sector or to officially call for its regulation; but as I indicated, can we collaborate and can we work together? Because of the mission, however, I believe that all options should be on the table, and I believe that we need to give these partnerships a chance. We need to know whether the Department is executing them effectively; and what can we do to help make them work better? I believe the owners and operators of these assets will in most cases act without regulation if an effective case for action is made and there is adequate and necessary follow- through by the Department, oversight, and the opportunity to share how we can do better. I want to learn from our witnesses, from the private sector how the Department can be more effective in encouraging this necessary and urgent activity. It is now time for an open and honest conversation about protecting our critical infrastructure. We are done with documents and verbiage; it is time for action. It is time for us to learn about the tools that you need and how this Congress can be helpful. We may not need a regulatory hammer, but we certainly need a national discussion about civic and corporate responsibility and cooperation. I believe, Chairman Langevin, that today's hearing is the beginning of establishing that cooperation and dialogue on behalf of the American people. I thank you. Mr. Langevin. I thank the gentlelady for her comments, and particularly the sentiment of our cooperation, I know that will continue, and I look forward to that. [The statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:] Prepared Statement of the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee, Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the urgent topic of private sector participation in protecting our country's critical infrastructure. I am particularly grateful to Chairman Langevin for inviting the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection to participate in this hearing, and I look forward to future collaboration where our issues of concern intersect. Today's hearing regards the implementation--or existence--of the cyber security elements of the Sector Specific Plans (SSPs) under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). Ranking Member Lungren and I take particular interest in this topic as DHS' infrastructure protection efforts fall under our subcommittee's jurisdiction. We have been--and continue to be--very vigilant about the Department's protection of our nation's critical infrastructure beyond cyber security, to also address physical and human considerations. Thanks to Chairman Langevin, however, we will learn today about how the Department is protecting critical infrastructure from a cybersecurity perspective, and I look forward to seeing how the lessons learned today apply to other critical infrastructure protection (CIP) programs. Thus far, I have not been very impressed with DHS' CIP efforts. CIP is a massive and unprecedented undertaking. According to the Homeland Security Act of , ``critical infrastructure'' includes ``systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, nation public health or safety any combination of these matters,'' Based upon this definition, ``critical infrastructure'' is not just bridges and water utilities, but also financial centers and transactions. It is, therefore, clear that when such a vast and important mission is combined with a young agency, it is incumbent upon it and its oversight committee to have frank and honest discussions about the efficacy of our CIP efforts. Protecting theses systems and assets from natural--and human-made disasters is exacerbated by the fact that approximately percent of the country's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. Furthermore, this Administration did not encourage the government to regulate and mandate private sector owners and operators protect their critical infrastructure but, instead, it encouraged voluntary partnerships. How well the Department manages this voluntary relationship with the private sector to protect our critical infrastructure is--and will continue to be--a major priority for our Committee, and my subcommittee specifically. Recently, Chairman Thompson and I directed Committee staff to investigate the implementation of the NIPP and SSPs to learn whether they are motivating private industry to protect our critical infrastructure. Because such a large task is based upon a voluntary partnership, we need to give great attention to whether actions are, indeed, being taken. That will be the focus of my attention at today''s hearing. The release of the NIPP and the SSPs was delayed significantly. Unfortunately, the threat to our critical infrastructure was not simultaneously delayed. As a result, we have to quickly determine whether these plans are being implemented by owners and operators to better protect our critical infrastructure. It is not enough to create large, nearly unreadable documents and to discuss processes; instead, we must focus on implementation and execution. For instance, we must have effective and efficient communication between private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure and all levels of government. On September , , Chairman Thompson and I sent a letter to Assistant Secretary Stephan and Director Caverly about the implementation of the SSPs and the status of the National Annual Report that is supposed to describe the implementation of protection efforts. Based upon the Department's responses, we are quite concerned about whether verifiable action is being taken by the private sector. I am not here to reprimand the private sector or to viscerally call for its regulation. Because of the mission, however, I believe that all options should be on the table. I believe that we need to give these partnerships a chance. We need to know whether the Department is executing them effectively. I believe the owners and operators of these assets will, in most cases, act without regulation if an effective case for action is made and there is adequate and necessary follow through by the Department. I want to learn from our witnesses from the private sector how the Department can be more effective in encouraging this necessary--and urgent--activity. It is now time for an open and honest conversation about protecting our critical infrastructure. We are done with documents and verbiage. It is time for action. It is time for us to learn about the tools you need and how this Congress can help. We may not need a regulatory hammer, but we certaintly need a national discussion about civic and corporate responsibility. Perhaps today's hearing begins that conversation and will lead to concrete steps that will make america truly safer. Mr. Langevin. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from California, Mr. Lungren, for the purpose of an opening statement. And, likewise, I look forward to working with the gentleman from California. Mr. Lungren. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the gentlelady and I thank the gentleman from Texas, Mr. McCaul. First of all, let me say that I believe that the Department of Homeland Security did a good job in putting together the sector-specific plans and coming up with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan under the direction of Colonel Stephan. I know, when he first came in, he was dissatisfied with what was then in the works, and asked us for extra time to make sure that we could put a good product together. And I think the Department has; I congratulate you on that. Frankly, it is a good piece of work. I am, as my colleagues are, dismayed by the recent GAO review which did find that most of the sectors lacked a process for identifying the consequences of cyber attacks against their assets. That is probably not surprising, because most Americans and most in Congress look at guns, gates, and guards as the traditional means of protecting our critical infrastructure; and it is only after stepping back a ways that we realize the importance of the cyber world in all of this. It is my feeling that a public-private partnership is absolutely essential, not just because , , , whatever percentage you want to say of our critical infrastructure is privately owned and operated; but the agility with which the private sector is able to adapt in the area of technology is at least the equal of those of us in government. We would do ourselves a disservice if we in any way followed procedures on the bureaucratic side or the regulatory side which denied us that agility, that creativity, and that ingenuity in responding to what are threats that change, not yearly, not monthly, not weekly, not daily, but, frankly, minute by minute. So I am very interested in the testimony we will receive today from both the public and the private sectors. But I hope that we will find a way to reach that balance that is necessary between government regulation and private ingenuity and effectiveness. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Langevin. I thank the gentleman for his opening statement. Mr. Langevin. Other members of the subcommittee are reminded that under the committee rules, opening statements may be submitted for the record. I now welcome our first panel of witnesses. I want to begin by thanking the panel for their patience and willingness to stick around. We wish we had a little more control over the schedule around this place, but it doesn't seem to work out that way. But I do want to begin by welcoming our first witness, Mr. Greg Garcia, Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications. Assistant Secretary Garcia oversees the Department of Homeland Security's mission to prepare for and respond to incidents that could degrade or overwhelm the operation of the Nation's information technology and communications infrastructure. So I welcome you, Mr. Secretary. Our second witness, Dave Powner, is the Director of Information Technology Management Issues at the Government Accountability Office. Thank you for your participation, and we welcome you here today, Mr. Powner. Our third witness is Mr. J. Michael Hickey, the Chairman of the Communications Sector Coordinating Council. Mr. Hickey is also the Vice President of Government Affairs and National Security Policy at Verizon. Welcome, Mr. Hickey. Our fourth witness is Mr. George Hender, the Chairman of the Banking and Financial Sector Coordinating Council. Mr. Hender is the Vice Chairman of the Options Clearing Corporation. Welcome to you, Mr. Hender. Without objection, the witnesses' full statements will be inserted into the record. Mr. Langevin. And I now ask each witness to summarize his statement for minutes, beginning with Assistant Secretary Garcia. The floor is yours. STATEMENT OF GREG GARCIA, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, OFFICE OF CYBERSECURITY AND TELECOMMUNICATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. Garcia. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, Madam Chairwoman, members of the subcommittees, thank you very much for inviting me again to speak about the Department of Homeland Security's effort to strengthen the security and resilience of our Nation's critical infrastructure. My comments today will focus on three areas: first, how my office has worked with each of the critical infrastructure and key resource sectors to ensure cybersecurity is integrated into their sector-specific plans, or SSPs; Second, I will report on the findings from our cybersecurity review of each SSP; and Third, our plan for continuing to increase attention that each sector gives to cybersecurity. Under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, or NIPP, my office, the Office of the Cybersecurity and Communications, works to reduce cyber risk and enhance cybersecurity in two ways. We serve as the Federal lead for the IT and communications sector infrastructure protection efforts, and as the lead for addressing the cross-sector cyber element for all sectors. Throughout the development of the SSPs, my office provided cybersecurity guidance and support to the sectors. This included providing sector-specific agencies with resources for identifying cybersecurity practices and protective programs, helping them identify cyber R&D priorities, and developing a comprehensive cyber guidance checklist which gave each sector a framework for integrating cybersecurity into their SSPs. In addition, sectors asked us to review drafts of their SSPs, and we provided recommendations on ways to address cybersecurity. My office also conducted a review of the cyber elements in each plan to determine sector-specific efforts and identify cross-sector trends. Our review was generally consistent with the findings of the GAO's analysis. In particular, I am pleased that the GAO found that out of the sectors were comprehensive in addressing cybersecurity and their SSPs. This is clear evidence of all the hard work that has been done to date. Since the development of the SSPs, sectors have been implementing their plans and enhancing efforts to address the security of their cyber infrastructure. Our review of the sector annual reports revealed an increased integration of cybersecurity considerations across the sectors. For example, more than half of the sectors identified at least one cybersecurity goal and/or priority. This is a significant improvement from the sector annual reports, and it is a strong indication of increased understanding about the importance of cybersecurity. Additionally, sectors are incorporating DHS-sponsored cybersecurity measures, such as our cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tool, into their risk assessment efforts. I would add, no discussion of cybersecurity and infrastructure protection efforts would be complete without mentioning the cross-sector cybersecurity working group. This group is composed of experts from each sector and serves to enhance cross-sector understanding of mutual dependencies and interdependencies. It is currently focused on addressing common cybersecurity challenges identified in each sector's initial SSP and developing improvements that can be leveraged across the sectors. Overall, while we are seeing greater attention given to cybersecurity, there is still more work to do. Each sector must consider their own cybersecurity posture and balance against other sector-specific risk management efforts. Specifically, sectors should continue to focus on identifying their critical cyber infrastructure, assessing their cyber risk, implementing protective programs, and measuring the effectiveness of their efforts. My office is currently engaging with sectors that may not have fully captured the good cybersecurity work they are already doing in their initial SSPs. We will work with them to more fully document their efforts as they update their SSPs and develop their sector annual reports. We will also continue to work with individual sectors to implement the cyber aspects of their SSPs in order to measurably enhance security within their sectors. We will conduct workshops with sectors to identify incentives, cyber metrics, and current and future cyber R&D requirements. The development of the SSPs represented a significant milestone for public and private sector national protection and preparedness activities. My office is committed to promoting cybersecurity strategies that can address the evolving risks we face. We are thankful for the work that has been done to date, and we encourage all sectors to continue working with us to address cybersecurity and their infrastructure protection activities. Thank you all for your time today, and I am happy to address any questions that you may have. Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Secretary Garcia, for your testimony. [The statement of Mr. Garcia follows:] Prepared Statement of Gregory Garcia Good afternoon, Chairman Langevin, Chairwoman Jackson-Lee, Ranking Member McCaul, Ranking Member Lungren, and Members of the Subcommittees. Thank you for inviting me to speak about our efforts to work with all critical infrastructure and key resource (CI/KR) sectors to address the security of the cyber elements of their infrastructures, including the incorporation of cyber security into their Sector-Specific Plans (SSP), progress in advancing mitigation actions, and plans for continuing to engage with the CI/KR sectors to further address cyber security. One of the most pressing challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is preparing for cyber attacks against our CI/ KR. Threats to the Nation's CI/KR are numerous and constantly evolving. The ability of threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities is facilitated by the widespread availability of tools, techniques, and information. A variety of cyber threats could exploit vulnerabilities in the Nation's CI/KR assets, systems, networks, and functions, potentially threatening national and economic security, public health and safety, and confidence in the government. The President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace recognized the importance of assessing threats and vulnerabilities and determining how likely or significant those attacks could be on critical infrastructure. It called for public-private partnerships to address five critical priorities: ( ) a national cyberspace security response system, ( ) a national cyberspace security threat and vulnerability reduction program, ( ) a national cyberspace security awareness and training program, ( ) securing governments' cyberspace, and ( ) national security and international cyberspace security cooperation. The first three priorities speak directly to the development and implementation of the SSPs. In implementing the National Strategy DHS' Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C), working in partnership with the Office of Infrastructure Protection (OIP), Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs), and public- and private-sector security partners, is committed to preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from cyber attacks and their consequences. CS&C's strategic goals include preparing for and deterring catastrophic incidents by achieving a collaborative risk management and deterrence capability with a mature partnership between government and the private sector. One example of this partnership is CS&C's National Coordinating Center (NCC). Since , the NCC has served as a forum through which the Federal government and private sector communications providers can interact face-to-face on a daily basis. This strategic goal also encompasses tactical efforts to secure and protect the Nation's cyber infrastructure from attacks and disasters by identifying and mitigating threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Our vision, philosophy, and strategy for preventing, responding to, and recovering from cyber attacks reflect the expanding and widespread importance of the cyber infrastructure. Policies that advance a safe and secure infrastructure rely on the valuable relationships between the public and private sectors and on public trust and confidence. The key to continued success is partnering strategically with the private sector to identify, prioritize and protect critical cyber assets, systems, networks and functions. Even though the private sector builds, owns and operates most of the cyber infrastructure, CS&C takes an active role in its protection by building public-private partnerships that are vital to our strategy to secure cyberspace and to facilitating efforts to raise cyber security awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces to secure cyberspace, improve technology through the identification of cyber research and development requirements, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, and exchange information. CS&C works to reduce cyber risk and enhance cyber security in two primary ways under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) framework: ( ) as Federal lead for the Information Technology (IT) Sector's infrastructure protection and preparedness responsibilities (in partnership with the Communications Sector); and ( ) as a cross- sector cyber element that involves DHS, the SSAs for each of the CI/ KR sectors, and public and private sector owners and operators. Homeland Security Presidential Directive designates DHS as the SSA for both the Communications and IT sectors. CS&C's National Communications System (NCS) and the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) carry out the SSA responsibility for the Communications and IT Sectors, respectively. Both sectors recently released their Sector Specific Plans (SSPs), which are planning documents that focus on overall sector preparedness, including managing risk to the sectors' critical functions and infrastructures that support homeland, economic, and national security. Under the NIPP framework, the Internet and its associated services are identified as a shared key resource of the IT and Communications Sectors, reflecting the convergence of voice and data communications networks and services. In their respective DHS- designated roles for the Communications and IT infrastructure sectors, the NCS and NCSD share responsibility with public--and private-sector security partners for the availability of the Internet and its associated services. Recognizing the synergies between IT and Communications, the chair of each sector's Government and Sector Coordinating Councils also participates in the other sector's council. In addition, representatives from the IT and communications sectors participate in each other's risk assessment methodology development efforts. Cyber Security in the Sector-Specific Plans In support of the cross-sector cyber responsibility, NCSD is working closely with OIP, the SSAs, and other security partners to integrate cyber security into the CI/KR sectors' protection and preparedness efforts. During the SSP development process, NCSD provided cyber expertise to the sectors, including reviews of draft SSPs and participation in sector-specific cyber security meetings. Specifically, as sectors were developing their SSPs, NCSD developed and provided information to SSAs on resources for cyber security practices and protective programs that are applicable across all sectors, as well as some that are more focused on individual sectors, to help inform the identification of cyber security-related protective programs. For each protective program, a brief description and the specific activities they supported within the preparedness spectrum were provided. NCSD also developed information on cyber research and development (R&D) requirements and priorities to help SSAs in the identification of cyber-related R&D priorities. A description of Federal organizations that support cyber R&D and several references to R&D documents that outlined specific cyber security initiatives were provided. NCSD also offered to work directly with any sector that requested assistance and worked with responding sectors to develop and review cyber security content for the SSPs. NCSD also developed a comprehensive SSP Cyber Guidance Checklist, which provided sectors with a framework for integrating cyber security throughout each section of their SSPs. The checklist complemented DHS' CI/KR Protection SSP Guidance developed by OIP and was intended to provide a starting point for SSAs as they integrated cyber into their SSPs. The checklist included an outline and guidance for the development of cyber content for the SSPs. NCSD shared the checklist in OIP-sponsored technical assistance sessions with SSAs to provide expertise and answer questions regarding the inclusion of cyber security in the SSPs. NCSD personnel also met individually with those SSA representatives who expressed an interest in determining approaches for incorporating cyber security into their SSPs and sector risk management efforts. In December and January , NCSD conducted a review of the final draft SSPs as part of OIP's review process to ( ) assess each sector's plan for securing its cyber infrastructure and ( ) understand the coordination between NCSD and the sectors needed to better secure the sector's cyber infrastructure. In addition to considering the full content of the SSPs, this review focused on specific areas where future coordination between NCSD and the sectors might be necessary to address the security of the cyber elements of the Nation's CI/KR, including the critical initial action to identify the sectors' cyber security partners that NCSD should engage with to manage cyber risk. NCSD also determined that coordination may be required in understanding how each sector plans to identify and assess risk to its cyber infrastructure. Coordination is also required when assisting sectors in the development or refinement of methodologies intended to identify critical cyber elements and to assess cyber risk. Finally, the review identified protective programs specific to cyber security that fall within NCSD's responsibility and cyber R&D priorities requiring coordination across the sectors and with DHS' Science and Technology Directorate. After the SSPs were finalized, NCSD conducted a second review of the documents on behalf of the Cross-Sector Cyber Security Working Group (CSCSWG). The CSCSWG provides a forum for exchanging information on common cyber security challenges and issues (i.e., threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences) and enhancing the understanding across sectors of mutual dependencies and interdependencies. The working group includes cyber security experts from the CI/KR sectors collaborating to identify systemic cyber risks and mitigation strategies for the Nation's CI/KR sectors. The CSCSWG held its inaugural meeting on May , , and determined that an initial area of focus would be reviewing the cyber security components of the SSPs to better understand the various efforts to protect cyber elements of the CI/KR sectors and identify trends in cyber infrastructure protection that cut across the sectors. Using the NCSD review as a starting point, the group provided input on sectors' cyber content and on cyber activities not fully captured or initiated after the drafting process. The group has begun to share successes, best practices, and lessons learned to help the development and implementation of more effective cyber risk management activities across the sectors. For example, through the CSCSWG, members learned about the Roadmap to Secure Control Systems in the Energy Sector. As a result, the Water and Chemical Sectors have chosen to initiate similar efforts to address the unique concerns of control systems security within their sectors. Progress in Advancing Mitigation Actions Many of the SSPs were created in summer and fall of . Sectors have been implementing the plans, continuing or initiating efforts to address the security of their cyber infrastructure. Sectors are not uniformly comprehensive in their cyber security efforts and should not necessarily be. Each sector must consider its cyber security posture and balance that against other risk management efforts, in consideration of the unique aspects of its infrastructure. Cyber risk varies by sector, based on its dependence on cyber elements. For example, the extensive use of control systems in the Energy Sector and of business systems in the Financial Services Sector must factor into the extent, sophistication, and unique implementation of mitigation and protection strategies within those sectors. Other sectors do not have cyber infrastructure integrated as ubiquitously in their essential services, a fact that influences the focus and maturity of their cyber security efforts. The length of time a sector's public and private partners have been working together on infrastructure protection issues is another factor in the comprehensiveness of their plans. These observations regarding the cyber security position of the SSPs are generally consistent with the findings of the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) analysis. The integration and maturing nature of cyber security across the CI/KR sectors was clear when NCSD reviewed and contributed to the Sector Annual Reports (SARs). The sectors' SARs were much improved over their initial efforts. For example, more than half of the sectors identified at least one cyber security goal and/or priority in their second SAR. This represents a significant increase in the number of sectors from the SAR, suggesting that the understanding of the importance of cyber security is becoming more pervasive in the sectors. Further, more sectors are implementing DHS-sponsored protective measures, such as the Comprehensive Review, the Risk Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection (RAMCAP), and the Site Assistance Visit programs. NCSD collaborates with OIP to incorporate cyber security into these DHS risk and vulnerability assessment programs so that sectors implementing them would address the cyber elements of their infrastructure. We encourage sectors to assess cyber risk by using the Cyber Security Vulnerability Assessment (CSVA), a flexible and scalable approach that analyzes an entity's cyber security posture and describes gaps and targeted considerations that can reduce overall cyber risks. It assesses the policies, plans, and procedures in place to reduce cyber vulnerability in categories (e.g., access control, configuration management, physical security of cyber assets, etc.) and leverages various recognized standards, guidance, and methodologies (e.g., International Organization for Standardization , Information Systems Audit and Control Association Control Objects for Information and related Technology, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication series). The CSVA tool is being used by six sectors in their tailored vulnerability assessments: five through their sector specific RAMCAP modules and another, the Transportation Sector, in its customized cyber security assessment. Plans for Continuing to Engage with the CI/KR Sectors to Further Address Cyber Security Our review of the SSPs and SARs found that sectors are paying attention to cyber security, but more needs to be done. Over the next year, sectors need to focus on identifying their critical cyber infrastructure, assessing cyber risk and promoting voluntary assessments, implementing protective programs, and measuring the effectiveness of their efforts. NCSD has created an action plan and is engaging with sectors in addressing cyber security issues not fully addressed in those sectors' initial SSPs. This action plan includes working with sectors to review cyber security priorities, assess effects of cyber attacks, develop protective programs, and evaluate R&D requirements and initiatives to identify areas where additional capabilities are needed. NCSD has already worked with the cyber experts of the Chemical Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) and the SSA to identify cyber security content needed for the update to their SSP. Some of the opportunities for engagement are based on sector specific needs, but others address more common challenges. The action plan will address both individual and more universal steps. While all sectors have established SCCs and Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs), the degree of examination of specific cyber risk and of cyber information sharing varies. Some sectors--such as Financial Services--consider cyber security as critical to their core business functions and integrate cyber security into all of their SSP implementation activities. In fact, the Financial Services SSA, the Department of the Treasury, sits on the IT GCC because of its interest and expertise in cyber security. Other sectors have historically had less focus on cyber security due to the lack of prominence of IT in the business of the sector. Representation from the sectors' SCCs and GCCs are participating in the CSCSWG provides a mechanism for two-way information flow on cyber concerns across all sectors. Participation in the CSCSWG may help less-mature sectors make more rapid progress in identifying cyber goals, gaps, and interdependencies, as well as developing programs to deter, respond and recover from cyber attacks by enabling them to leverage the experiences, work, and cyber functional expertise that exists in many sectors. In addition, the reliance of some sectors on control systems highlights an area for increased coordination of risk management efforts. NCSD's Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) and the Process Control Systems Forum (PCSF) are resources to help address control systems risk. The CSSP coordinates efforts among Federal, State, local, and tribal governments, as well as control system owners, operators, and vendors, to improve control system security within and across all critical infrastructure sectors. In support of risk mitigation efforts, the CSSP developed the Control Systems Cyber Security Self Assessment Tool and provides training in control systems cyber security. The PCSF, a standing group under the CSCSWG, works to develop solutions for process control systems security, aggregate information, connect decision makers, and leverage other groups' work. Sectors may leverage the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to share information on cyber threats and vulnerabilities and enhance situational awareness. The timely detection and analysis of cyber attacks further helps to assess operational risk and mitigate the impact on our Nation's critical infrastructures of cyber vulnerabilities. US-CERT is working with the Information Sharing and Analysis Center Council to expand this operational interaction. Finally, most sectors are taking on the challenge of identifying or developing metrics to measure the effectiveness of all infrastructure protection efforts, including those for cyber. Since sectors have different overall approaches to infrastructure identification and risk management, NCSD will work with the sectors to develop some cross- sector qualitative measures that correlate to cyber security to help measure the effectiveness of sectors' cyber security efforts. Conclusion The development of the CI/KR SSPs represented a significant milestone in sectors' protection and preparedness activities. Sectors varied in how they addressed the security of the cyber elements of their infrastructures, including the incorporation of cyber security into their SSPs, but demonstrated increased understanding of the importance of cyber security in the SARs and implementation activities. As the sectors work to address the feedback from the GAO on the cyber security aspects of the SSPs, CS&C, and specifically, NCSD will continue to execute its cross-sector cyber responsibility to work with sectors to reduce cyber risk and enhance cyber security. Our goal is to create a clear and actionable path forward with the sectors and to work together to secure our critical cyber infrastructure. NCSD will continue to schedule regular interactions with individual sectors as well as meetings with multiple sectors. For example, we plan to meet with each SSA at least twice a year, once before the sectors update their SSPs and once in early spring of as sectors are preparing their SARs. NCSD will develop guidance on cyber elements that should be considered for inclusion in the SSPs and SARs. This guidance will complement guidance from the Office of Infrastructure Protection. NCSD will also work with sectors through their coordinating councils to identify cyber subject matter experts within their sectors and raise awareness of the sectors' reliance on cyber infrastructure. NCSD is piloting this approach by convening a small group of cyber security experts with security clearances from across the sectors to support the SSA risk assessment process for the National CI/KR Protection Annual Report. NCSD also plans to offer workshops in with sector partners and other invited subject matter experts to address incentives to encourage voluntary risk assessments, develop cross-sector cyber metrics, and identify existing cyber research and development projects. The outcome of these workshops will provide sectors with ideas for incentives for investing in cyber security, metrics that enable realistic evaluation of cyber security, and cyber R&D priorities. NCSD will also continue to support the efforts of the CSCSWG as it addresses opportunities to enhance cyber security across the sectors and share information about strong cyber programs and practices. Further, NCSD will continue to roll out important efforts like the CSVA, software assurance, and control systems acquisition guidance, training, and cyber exercises to our sector partners. We encourage sectors to continue to work collaboratively with NCSD on addressing cyber security in their infrastructure protection activities. Through participation in the CSCSWG, individual meetings with NCSD, and various NCSD-sponsored workshops and programs, sectors can make significant progress in the future to address or more fully address cyber security. We must reinforce a culture of preparedness, shift from a reactive to a proactive stance, and prepare by promoting effective cyber security strategies that evolve as the risks evolve. There is much work to be done, but progress continues every day. We rely on the support and expertise of the sectors to advance this mission. I would like to thank the Subcommittees for their time today, and I appreciate this opportunity to discuss these important cyber security priorities. Mr. Langevin. I now recognize Mr. Powner to summarize his statement for minutes. Welcome. STATEMENT OF DAVID POWNER, DIRECTOR, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT ISSUES, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE Mr. Powner. Chairman Langevin, Chairwoman Jackson Lee, Ranking Members McCaul and Lungren, and members of the subcommittees, we appreciate the opportunity to testify on our report being released today on cybersecurity elements of the sector plans to protect our Nation's critical infrastructures. Chairman Langevin and Ranking Member McCaul, I would like first to thank you for your leadership and oversight of the Nation's cyber critical infrastructure. As the focal point for SSP, DHS has many cyber-related roles and responsibilities that are called for in law and policy that we have previously testified on before this subcommittee. These are highlighted in detail in my written statement. One of these is the development of a comprehensive national plan that requires each of the sectors to develop sector-specific plans that include how each sector will identify, assess, and protect its cyber assets. Today's request is--I will discuss how well these plans address key cyber aspects of cybersecurity and GAO's observations and recommendations to move beyond the planning phase. The extent to which the sectors address aspects of cybersecurity and their plans varied. The strongest plans were the ones from the IT and communications sectors, while the weakest included the agriculture and commercial facilities sectors. The banking and finance sectors assessment fell near the middle of these plans. DHS has acknowledged these shortcomings and has stated that these are only early efforts by sectors to develop their respective plans. DHS attributed the variations to several items, including the maturity of the sector and the extent to which the sector worked with DHS to develop their plans. Nevertheless, until these plans fully address the key cyber elements, infrastructure sectors may not adequately identify, prioritize, and protect critical cyber assets. Another reason why these plans are incomplete is that based on our broader work for the full committee and for the subcommittee chaired by Ms. Jackson Lee, some of the sectors claim that these plans are not that useful. In particular, some sectors believe that they have progressed beyond these plans. In these cases, then, this is just a paper exercise. It is important to note that these are just plans. They do not identify actual assets and vulnerabilities; rather, they identify approaches the sectors will pursue. Moving forward, if in fact these plans are truly to be used to identify gaps in our Nation's cyber protection efforts on a national level, as intended, these plans need to be improved, meaning that they comprehensively address cyber elements and, even more importantly, the plans need to be effectively implemented. From an oversight perspective, it will be important to track how these plans evolve and are implemented in the critical infrastructure protection annual report due to the Executive Office of the President each September, although we hear that this year's report will be issued in November. Beyond its involvement with developing and implementing these plans, DHS's national Cybersecurity Division needs to continue to bolster its capabilities so that it is viewed as a valuable service provider to infrastructure owners. Today, this is not necessarily the case. To its credit, DHS's efforts to lead cyber exercises, like Cyber Storm, provide valuable information to participants to improve response, and coordination mechanisms. However, our Nation still lacks a national threat assessment and a mature analysis and warning capability, an area that we are currently reviewing for you, Mr. Chairman. If DHS is to effectively fulfill its role as the focal point for cyber critical infrastructure protection, it must fulfill more of its responsibilities and build more capability. Our Nation continues to progress at a slow pace in implementing this sector-based approach to protecting our Nation's critical infrastructures. We are almost years into this approach, and although there is some progress in areas, we are not where we need to be. Unless we start making more progress and actually protecting our critical infrastructures, we may want to consider alternative approaches such as prioritizing and protecting by asset criticality regardless of sector. In summary, Mr. Chairman, and Madam Chair, if the sector- based approach to protecting our Nation's critical infrastructures is to be effective, we will need comprehensive plans. However, ultimately our Nation needs to move beyond the planning stages and into implementation of effective protective and recovery programs. Implementation of these plans is more likely if DHS can successfully fulfill its responsibilities and become a provider of valuable information on threats and analytical products to our Nation's critical infrastructure owners. This concludes my statement. I will be pleased to respond to questions. Mr. Langevin. I thank you, Mr. Powner, for your testimony. [The statement of Mr. Powner follows:]\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \See For the Record. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- M. Langevin. And the Chair now recognizes Mr. Hickey for his statement for minutes. STATEMENT OF J. MICHAEL HICKEY, CHAIRMAN, TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR COORDINATING COUNCIL Mr. Hickey. Good afternoon, Chairman Langevin and Chairwoman Jackson Lee, Ranking Members McCaul and Mr. Lungren. It is a pleasure to be here representing the communications sector and to testify on behalf of the sector in terms of what we are doing day in and day out to advance not only cybersecurity, but business continuity and emergency preparedness practice within our sector. What I would like to do in my few minutes with you is to discuss four areas of involvement. The first is focused on what companies like Verizon do day in and day out that really addresses not only cybersecurity, but broader asset protection within our companies. I would also like to spend a few minutes talking about the collaborative activity that is under way, again day in and day out not only within our sector, but with our partners in government. Third, I will speak briefly to the Communications Sector Coordinating Council structure and the work that we are doing on our sector-specific plan. And I will conclude with a few observations in terms of what I think we can do, what we must do, with government, going forward. Effective industry and government collaboration starts with the actions of individual organizations. The private sector owns and operates from to percent of this country's critical infrastructure. Because of industry's important role in national and homeland security, corporations like Verizon must dedicate the operations, experience, resources, and oversight necessary to be as self-aware and self-reliant as possible. Verizon's communications, voice, data, and video networks are touched by over million consumers and government and business customers daily. Because of this reach, we have a longstanding and growing commitment to national security and emergency preparedness. For instance, we have designed, built, and managed networks that are resilient and redundant. We have adopted best-practice business methods and security procedures. We have created and tested business continuity and emergency preparedness programs. We have responded successfully to a wide range of crises and have provided leadership to industry and government organizations dedicated to national security and emergency preparedness. From a structural standpoint internally, we have corporate policy statements that require attention to business continuity, emergency preparedness, and cybersecurity. We have a number of senior leaders within our business from a chief information officer, who is an executive vice president, to a new chief technology officer, again another executive vice president, to the announcement of a new chief security officer for Verizon Corporation who will start with us in January, who currently serves as executive assistant director of the FBI for Criminal, Cyber, and International Security. We have groups within our IT organization that serve as service bureaus to all of our business units to make sure that cybersecurity practices are designed, engineered, and adopted business unit by business unit. We actually focus on security within our company from more of an organic standpoint. We rely on ground-up business unit activity, identifying and dealing with issues; and beyond that, to coordinate activity across our corporation, we have executive security councils and a Verizon information security council that is responsible not only for oversight, but to make sure that best practices are implemented within our business organizations. We have a cyber intrusion response team that provides -by- coverage for the entire enterprise, supporting all business units and organizational points of contact to assess intrusion impacts, contain and control further dissemination of problem areas across the company, and capture and preserve evidence for law enforcement and legal purposes. So, within Verizon Corporation, as within many other corporations that I work with day in and day out, there are strong practices in place. There is a real focus day in and day out on cybersecurity and critical assets protection within our organizations. I would like to address, just for a minute, sector collaboration. Verizon and its peer companies within the communications sector have a long history of cooperation on national security and emergency preparedness. We have a -year history that stems back to the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis when the National Communications System was created to deal with issues of interoperability and sustainable communications. Since that time, in , the National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications was formed as a partner organization with the National Communications System. It was broadened. It was established when Executive Order created it, and it has focused since that time on making sure that industry and government work together closely day in and day out on a full range of asset protection measures. The focus is on facilitating information sharing among government and industry participants regarding vulnerability, threat, intrusion, and anomaly information affecting the telecommunications infrastructure. I might point to the recent Southern California fires where the NCC Watch took a real leadership role in coordinating private sector and government information, sharing real-time on what was happening within the field and how industry and government could respond together. That information developed there was shared with a joint field office when established on the West Coast. There is a network reliability and interoperability council established by the FCC back in . There have been a series of seven councils since that time. Most have focused on some aspect of security practice. Verizon and industry in general have been very active in working not only with the FCC, but with other government partners in advancing sound practice on a voluntary basis as a result of the work done within the NRIC. There is another organization called the National Security Information Exchange. In , the NCS focused on actions industry and government could pursue to protect critical telecommunications from the growing hacker threat. Ultimately, the NCS and NSTAC created national security information exchanges. These exchanges, since that time, have brought together expertise from government and subject matter experts on security practice from industry to address a full range of security practices relevant to the evolving risk environment. Pertinent to the Communications Sector Coordinating Council, I am very proud to be its chair for this year, and it points out the complexities, I think, of working together not just within our sector, but on a cross-sector basis; and we have focused very much on our interdependencies not just within our sector, but across sectors. The Communications Sector Coordinating Council became operational in calendar year . It was chartered to foster the coordination of policy initiatives to improve the physical and cybersecurity of sector assets and to ease the flow of information within the sector, across sectors, and with designated Federal agencies. We now embrace member companies that are broadly representative of the sector. I think that is a real benefit of the Sector Coordinating Council's having been established, because we are not just traditional wireline and wireless; we are satellite, we are undersea cable. We represent the National Broadcasters, the Association of Public Television Stations, a wide range of companies. To summarize, the sector has been very proactive through the Sector Coordinating Council, through other mechanisms, and we have really focused on our sector-specific plan, currently on the risk assessment which we plan to have complete by the end of this calendar year in draft form and in final form by the end of the first quarter next year. Thank you. Mr. Langevin. Thank you. [The statement of Mr. Hickey follows:] Prepared Statement of J. Michael Hickey Overview: Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, my name is Mike Hickey and I thank you for the opportunity to testify before you on measures we have taken to address cybersecurity in the Communications Sector Specific Plan. I serve as Vice President of Government Affairs for National Security Policy at Verizon and as Chair of the Communications Sector Coordinating Council. I also serve as Vice Chair of the Internet Security Alliance and am an active member of the US Chamber of Commerce Homeland Security Task Force. Of these organizations, the Communications Sector Coordinating Council is uniquely chartered to represent the breadth of the communications sector on policy issues relating to the protection of critical communications infrastructure and key assets. Since , it has emerged as an instrument for business engagement with government on policy matters relating to homeland security and emergency preparedness. My comments will address the roles that have been established for industry and government in protecting the nation's critical physical and cyber communications assets, steps taken to protect these assets, what measures have worked effectively and what needs to be done to sharpen the collective focus as we move forward. Tiered Approach to Critical Asset Protection: Effective industry and government collaboration starts with the actions of individual organizations. The private sector owns and operates nearly % of this country's critical infrastructure. Because of industry's important role in national and homeland security, corporations like Verizon must dedicate the operations experience, resources and oversight necessary to be as self-aware and self-reliant as possible. Verizon is obligated to its shareowners and customers to take the steps necessary to secure its cyber, physical and human assets from disruption or attack. We cooperate with peer companies in order to support communications sector mutual aid obligations. We also proactively address our interdependencies with other sectors to ensure continuity of operations in time of crisis. Finally, we continue to work with government agencies at the Federal, State, regional and local levels to support appropriate security and emergency preparedness initiatives. Strength from Within: Verizon Communications Inc. is a Dow company. It employs over , employees. In , the company generated $ billion in annual revenue and spent $ . billion on capital investments. Verizon's state-of-the-art voice, data and video networks are touched by over million consumers and government and business customers daily. Given its breadth of service and geographic coverage, Verizon's commitment to national security and emergency preparedness--grounded in corporate policy, sound business practice and hands-on experience--is long-standing and growing. In order to ensure the continuity of its own operations and to meet the requirements of its critical customers in time of crisis, Verizon has: Designed, built and managed network facilities that are robust and resilient; Embraced ``best practice'' business methods and security procedures; Created and tested business continuity and emergency preparedness programs that have served the corporation and its customers in times of stress; Responded successfully to a wide range of crises; and, Provided leadership strength to industry and government organizations dedicated to national security and emergency preparedness. Verizon's Internal Security Councils: Verizon takes a holistic approach to addressing information security by coordinating business unit activity around network and information protection. This effort is led by the Verizon Executive Security Council (VESC), established in to oversee all aspects of information security within Verizon. Reporting to the VESC is the Verizon Information Security Council (VISC), an enterprise-wide, cross-organizational working committee comprised of lead security managers and information security teams. The VISC is charged with instituting a secure environment for company network, information management, processing, transport and delivery. The Verizon business units that comprise the VISC are dedicated to providing coordinated information and network security services for Verizon. These services include firewall support, host (mainframe and distributed) management, virus protection, risk assurance, information security practices, information security awareness, Incident Response & Vulnerability scanning, and remote access security administration. Computer Intrusion Response Team (CIRT): The Verizon CIRT provides x coverage for the entire enterprise, supporting all business units and organizational points of contact to assess intrusion impacts, contain and control further dissemination of problems across the company, and capture and preserve evidence for law enforcement/legal purposes. The CIRT also provides restoration options, identifies and closes security vulnerabilities (exploited or otherwise), and uses secure communication channels during response. The CIRT's network of contacts and organizational breadth enable it to effectively work with the appropriate company personnel to coordinate incident response and resolution. A single point of contact is designated for all network or computer related security advisories to the enterprise, thus eliminating duplication of information and effort by quality checking all data prior to distribution. A historical repository of advisory data is also maintained for reference. Management Structure: Verizon has sharpened its focus in addressing its evolving challenges in network technology and security. Key internal organizations have been realigned to apply consistent, best practice solutions to IT and network technology across business units. Verizon's Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer has oversight over a range of technical support organizations serving the company's major business units. Meanwhile, a newly created position of Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer has responsibility for establishing and managing the overall direction, technology and planning of all Verizon networks. The CTO in each of Verizon's business groups remains responsible for the day-to-day execution of their network deployment strategies. Technical Support:T A full array of internal technical, consulting and R&D services are available to guide decision making and strengthen best practice within all major business units. For instance, the Verizon Information and Network Security organization advances security strategies that integrate people, process and technology (such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, virus protection, and remote access) with full adherence to information security policies and practices; while also providing technical and consulting services to business units--all with a primary focus on information asset protection. Verizon Information Security Focus is Crucial: In today's evolving threat environment, malicious insiders are the greatest threat to our critical national infrastructures. Today's geo-political climate will result in cyber attacks against national communications and control systems of economic, safety, or political significance. And politically (ideologically) motivated cyber attacks are increasing in volume, sophistication, and coordination. Verizon is addressing today's very real threats. Standards organizations must address carrier class security issues and architectures. The vendor community needs to produce equipment & software that meet Verizon's security objectives. And our customers and peer carriers need to work with us to mitigate security risks. Sector Leadership and Collaboration: Verizon, and its peer companies within the Communications Sector, have a long history of cooperation in national security and emergency preparedness. This history distinguishes the Communications Sector from most other critical sectors identified in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. The sector personifies cooperation and trusted relationships that have resulted in the delivery of critical services when emergencies and disasters occur. A strong bond between the private and public sectors exists today in large part because of several organizations that were created in response to earlier threats to the nation's critical infrastructure. National Communications System: The Sector Specific Agency for the Communications Sector is the National Communications System (NCS), currently housed within the Department of Homeland Security's National Cyber Security and Communications Division. The NCS was established by President Kennedy in the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis when communications problems between the United States and key international players threatened to further complicate the crisis. Since , the NCS has worked to strengthen the communications facilities and components of various Federal agencies, focusing on interconnectivity and survivability. National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications: In , telecommunications industry and Federal Government officials identified the need for a joint mechanism to coordinate the initiation and restoration of national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications services. In , Executive Order broadened the NS/EP role of the National Communications System and created the National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications as a central public-private sector organization to coordinate response to emergency communications situations. In January , the NCC was designated an Information Sharing and Analysis Center for Telecommunications in accordance with PDD- . The NCC-ISAC facilitates information sharing among government and industry participants regarding vulnerability, threat, intrusion, and anomaly information affecting the telecommunications infrastructure. The National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC): The NSTAC was created years ago, in , by Executive Order . NSTAC provides another highly successful example of how the private sector helps direct government decisions around national security and emergency preparedness communications (NS/EP). This advisory committee to the President brings together industry chief executives representing major telecommunications companies, network providers, information technology companies, finance and aerospace businesses. NSTAC provides industry-based advice and expertise to the President on a wide range of telecommunications problems related to implementing NS/EP communications policy issues. These include, but are not limited to, information security, information assurance, and critical infrastructure protection. NS/EP communications enable the government to make an immediate and coordinated response to all emergencies, including cyber attacks. NS/EP communications allow the President and other senior Administration officials to be continually accessible, even under stressed conditions. The impact of today's dynamic technological and regulatory environment is profound with new technologies and increasing competition bringing both new opportunities and new vulnerabilities to the information infrastructure. The NSTAC is strongly positioned to offer advice to the President on how to leverage this dynamic environment to enrich NS/EP communications capabilities and ensure that new architectures fulfill requirements to support NS/EP operations; and to avoid introducing vulnerabilities into the information infrastructure that could adversely affect NS/EP communications services. The NSTAC's current work plan includes issues ranging from information sharing and the security and reliability of converged networks to research and development (R&D) issues related to converged networks. The Network Reliability and Interoperability Council (NRIC): Government-imposed solutions may hinder the ability of business to adapt and respond effectively to the changing threat environment. So it becomes critical for business and government to work collaboratively towards solutions that are meaningful, adaptable and sustainable. The voluntary development of and compliance with ``best/sound practice'' approaches to physical and cyber security is a model that is time tested. It is illustrated through the work of the Federal Communications Commission's Network Reliability and Interoperability Council. The NRIC is a successor to the National Reliability Council, first established in . Through the work of seven successive councils, subject matter experts from business and government have come together to address network reliability and interoperability issues of concern, develop best/sound practices and encourage voluntary adoption. The NRIC will soon merge with the Media Security and Reliability Council (MSRC) to create a new organization, the Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC). National Security Information Exchange (NSIE): In April , the Chairman of the National Security Council's Policy Coordinating Committee requested the NCS Manager identify what actions industry and Government should pursue to protect critical NS/EP telecommunications from the growing ``hacker'' threat. The NCS Manager subsequently requested that the NSTAC provide industry's perspective on the network security issue. Ultimately NSTAC created a mechanism for security information exchange and produce a corresponding implementation plan. The NSTAC and NCS Manager also established separate, but closely coordinated, Network Security Information Exchanges (NSIEs). In May , the NSIE charters were finalized, and NSTAC companies and government departments and agencies designated their NSIE representatives, chairmen, and vice-chairmen. The NSTAC and government NSIEs held their first joint meeting in June . Industry and government coordinate through their respective NSIEs to voluntarily share sensitive information on threats to operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning systems supporting the telecommunications infrastructure. Government NSIE members include departments and agencies that use national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications services, represent law enforcement, or have information relating to network security threats and vulnerabilities. NSTAC NSIE representatives include subject matter experts who are engaged in prevention, detection, and/or investigation of telecommunications software penetrations or have security and investigative responsibilities. The Communications Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC) and its Sector Specific Plan (SSP): Verizon recognizes its critical operational dependence on other sectors and has established the necessary vendor relationships to meet both normal and extraordinary continuity of business requirements. In turn, all critical sectors are heavily reliant on the Communications Sector to support their own continuity of operations. The Homeland Security Act of provided the basis for DHS' role in the protection of the nation's critical infrastructure and key resources (CI/KR.) The Act assigned DHS responsibility for developing a comprehensive national plan for securing CI/KR in conjunction with other Federal agencies, State and local agencies and authorities, the private sector and other entities. The complexity of cross sector independencies was recognized in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, resulting from Homeland Security Presidential Directive . HSPD- focused on the identification, prioritization and protection of the nation's critical assets. It prescribed the development of the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and corresponding Sector Specific Plans. Perhaps most significantly, the NIPP encouraged the establishment of sector coordinating councils. In so doing, it brought greater sector diversity to the table and significantly advanced the institutional capacity of sectors to formally and proactively address cross-sector dependencies. Communications Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC): The Communications Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC) became operational in calendar year . It was chartered to foster the coordination of policy initiatives to improve the physical and cyber security of sector assets, and ease the flow of information within the sector, across sectors and with designated Federal agencies. Through the CSCC, private-sector owners, operators and suppliers can engage Federal government entities to: identify and coordinate policy issues related to the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources; facilitate the sharing of information related to physical and cyber threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, potential protective measures, and best practices; and, address policy issues related to response and recovery activity and communication following an incident or event. The CSCC now embraces member companies and has become more representative of the diversity of the Communications sector. Members include wireline, wireless, cable, satellite, information service providers, as well as commercial and public broadcasters, service integrators, and equipment vendors. Small and medium size companies are represented through CTIA, USTelecom, ITA and NCTA. Verizon currently chairs the CSCC. CSCC members meet quarterly to review industry and government actions on critical infrastructure protection priorities, confer with Federal agency representatives, review cross sector CIP issues, and coordinate with industry participants in NSTAC and the NCC ISAC to ensure industry coordination. Council work groups meet frequently to engage industry and government SME's on task force initiatives. Top CSCC priorities include the sector's risk assessment of critical assets, cross sector pandemic planning and implementation of access and credentialing and emergency wireless protocols. The CSCC and IT Sector Coordinating Councils maintain close coordination on a range of policy and operational initiatives. Both sectors participate in a recently formed cross sector cyber security work group. Both have worked to heighten industry's role in NS/EP exercises such as last summer's ESF exercise in New Orleans and in TopOff . In the aftermath of Katrina, the Councils met to discuss ways of strengthening industry preparation and response to major events. Both participate in ongoing sector risk assessment activity. Both organizations have elected sector liaisons to attend each other's coordinating council meetings and they meet annually to confer, with government counterparts, on ongoing sector activity. Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCIS): The Communications Sector Coordinating Council is a member of the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security (PCIS.), a private sector organization. PCIS is comprised of the leadership from each of the Sector Coordinating Councils, which represent the owners and operators of the critical infrastructure and key resources sectors identified by the government in HSPD- . The mission of PCIS is to coordinate cross-sector initiatives that promote public and private efforts to help ensure secure, safe, and reliable critical infrastructure services. This mission encompasses physical, cyber, and human security that rely on strong infrastructure integrity and resilience. Accordingly, the PCIS mission spans the full spectrum of critical infrastructure matters from prevention, planning, and preparedness to business continuity, mitigation, response, and recovery. The PCIS has worked to encourage a productive industry partnership with the Federal government over the past six years. It was formally recognized as the Private Sector Cross-Sector Council in the National Infrastructure protection Plan when it was released in . The NIPP states that the ``cross-sector issues and interdependencies are addressed among the sector coordinating councils through PCIS. PCIS members, including the CSCC, continue to work with designated Federal agencies on implementation of their sector specific plans. Communications Sector Specific Plan (CSSP): The CSCC completed work on the CSSP for critical infrastructure and key resource (CI/KR) protection, as recommended by the NIPP, in December the plan was subsequently released in May . It was developed jointly by industry and the National Communications System, with input from Federal government agencies ranging from the US Department of Commerce to the Federal Communications Commission. The CSSP provides a framework for protecting the Nation's critical communications assets and key resources. It addresses asset identification, risk assessment and mitigation, protective programs and government measurements. The goals of the CSSP include the need to: Protect the overall health of the national communications backbone; Rapidly reconstitute critical communications services after national and regional emergencies; Plan for emergencies and crises by participating in exercises and updating response and continuity of operations plans; Develop protocols to manage the exponential surge in utilization during an emergency situation and ensure the integrity of sector networks during and after an emergency event; Educate stakeholders on communications infrastructure resiliency and risk management practices in the Communications Sector; Ensure timely, relevant, and accurate threat information sharing between the law enforcement and intelligence communities and key decision makers in the sector; Establish effective cross-sector coordination mechanisms to address critical interdependencies, including incident situational awareness, and cross-sector incident management. The CSSP acknowledges the lead role played by private sector owners and operators in protecting critical assets. The communications companies that own, operate and supply the Nation's communications infrastructure have historically factored natural disasters and accidental disruptions into network resiliency architecture, business continuity plans, and disaster recovery strategies. The interconnected and interdependent nature of these service provider networks has fostered crucial information sharing and cooperative response and recovery relationships for decades. The CSSP also articulates the role of the Federal government in providing the support and resources necessary to identify threats and help mitigate risk. The Communications Sector's strategy is to ensure the nation's communications networks and systems are secure, resilient, and rapidly restored after an incident. The approach outlined in the CSSP includes: Defining industry and government roles in protecting communications infrastructure by leveraging corporate capabilities and government programs; Adopting an architectural approach to infrastructure identification and risk assessment processes; Coordinating with other sectors and customers on critical infrastructure dependencies and solutions for mitigating risk; and Working closely with DHS to advance sector protection and mitigation measures. The CSSP defines the three major arenas where risk assessments are conducted: industry self-assessments; government-sponsored assessments and government-sponsored cross sector dependency analyses. Industry self-assessments of risk are ongoing. Such assessments are conducted to verify compliance with company policies, industry standards, contract agreements and regulatory requirements. Throughout , industry has turned its attention to working with government to define relevant government sponsored assessments through a National Sector Risk Assessment (NSRA) process. Through this process, industry and government have undertaken a qualitative risk analysis of Communications Sector infrastructure and have narrowed the scope of risk assessments to nationally critical network elements. This process will result in a draft government assessment by December , with a final report to be completed by March . Based on the outcomes of this government assessment process, government may conduct more quantitative assessments of selected architecture elements in conjunction with industry. The third and final element of the CSSP risk assessment process is the analysis that government will undertake with industry on cross- sector dependencies. Work will commence in , the process will identify high-level critical sector communications dependencies and will leverage NCS risk assessment methodologies to identify communications dependencies specific to a facility or function. The goal will be to assist other sectors in the assessment of communications dependencies for high-risk assets. The Communications and IT Sector Coordinating Councils have worked to ensure that respective risk assessment efforts, although distinct, are complementary where the sectors overlap. This cross-sector participation increases information sharing, including lessons learned. In each sector, cyber threats associated with the sector's functional or network elements will be identified and vulnerabilities and consequences associated with such threats will be assessed to determine risk. Whatever success the CSCC has achieved in the development of the CSSP has resulted from industry's singular focus on developing a critical asset protection plan that is designed by industry for implementation by industry. In order to accomplish this, the NCS stepped forward to advocate industry positions within the Department of Homeland Security and with DHS project contractors. A strong element of social capital exists among industry representatives and Federal agency personnel within the Communications Sector. This trusted relationship helped to produce a practical, meaningful asset protection framework that can now be used by industry and government partners to better meet the country's security requirements. The CSSP is realistic and well- grounded. Critical Asset Protection Over the Long Term: What cannot be underestimated by policymakers is the enormous amount of private sector resources that are being devoted to finding solutions--with government partners--to achieve greater effectiveness in our country's security and response programs. The Communications Sector continues to commit significant financial resources and subject matter expertise to strengthen critical business practices. It will continue to dedicate time and expertise to its work with the NCS and other Federal, state and local government partners to address emerging operational and policy issues. To ensure even greater effectiveness in protecting the Nation's critical communications infrastructure--both physical and cyber-- industry and government partners must be clear about their respective roles in getting the job done. Industry is the first line of defense in protecting assets and mitigating risks, and aggressive business continuity and security practice will remain critically important as the Nation's risk environment continues to evolve. Although the Communications Sector's long history of coordination will change as industry restructuring continues, close planning and coordination within the sector will continue to be a mainstay of efforts to fortify physical and cyber security programs. Government must continue to ensure clarity of roles and responsibilities among all levels of government and the private sector. It should continue to advocate for strong sector and cross sector collaboration on operational and policy issues and in providing the necessary intelligence and operational support to ensure effective industry preparedness and response, in particular by refining and improving roles and responsibilities in the National Response Framework. Although industry and government have made progress on long standing issues pertaining to protection of critical assets and key resources, much work lies ahead. There must be an even greater Federal government focus on effective engagement and integration of state and local authorities in all aspects of critical infrastructure protection and emergency response, including the rollout and coordination of initiatives ``on the ground''. For instance, practical steps on access and credentialing and emergency wireless protocols for shutdown and restoration of service must be taken to facilitate industry response to natural or man-made disasters. Myriad jurisdictional laws and requirements may be complex, but real world execution is overdue. Government must also continue to integrate industry more fully on operational planning, coordination and joint policy initiatives. Effective partnerships require early involvement of industry and direct engagement in government programs, including protection and response plans, which impact the private sector's critical industry assets. Although government has recognized the importance of sharing timely threat intelligence with industry, more needs to be done in this area to advance NS/EP interests. Finally, recent Congressionally mandated changes in organization and functions within DHS need to be fully implemented and understood by all stakeholders in the critical infrastructure protection and emergency response domain. In sum, Industry and the Federal government have much to do on the full array of critical infrastructure protection initiatives, while advancing transition plans for the upcoming change in Administration. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony. I would be happy to answer any questions you or the subcommittee might have about Verizon or the Communications Sector. Mr. Langevin. I now recognize Mr. Hender to summarize your statement for minutes. STATEMENT OF GEORGE HENDER, BANKING/FINANCIAL SECTOR COORDINATING COUNCIL, AND MANAGEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN, OPTIONS CLEARING CORPORATION Mr. Hender. Chairman Langevin, Chairwoman Jackson Lee, Ranking Members McCaul and Lungren, and members of both subcommittees, my name is George Hender, and I am Chairman of the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council, also known as FSSCC. I am pleased to appear today on FSSCC's behalf to discuss the important topic of cybersecurity. FSSCC was established by the Department of Treasury. FSSCC is a private sector coalition of the Nation's leading banks, financial firms, insurance companies, and their trade associations. FSSCC worked collaboratively with Treasury, our sector specific agency, and with FSSCC, our government coordinating council, to craft our sector-specific plan. Our plan identifies three specific goals: first, to maintain a sector strong position of resilience, risk management, and redundant systems; Second, to manage the risk posed by cross-sector interdependencies; and Third, to work with law enforcement, the private sector, and our international counterparts to track and arrest criminals. The remainder of my testimony will focus on FSSCC's efforts to meet these goals in the area of cybersecurity. Modern financial services are built on a foundation of informational technology. Financial firms' systems are a target for cyber attack because that is where the money is. As the nature and the complexity of attacks grow more sophisticated, FSSCC continues to implement a number of cyber-related initiatives. I would like to highlight some of those initiatives. A year prior to the National Infrastructure Protection Plan's release in , FSSCC formed the first sector R&D committee. In April , this committee published The Research Challenges, a report identifying eight specific R&D priorities. An overarching theme throughout this report is protecting the sector from cyber attacks. In October , the R&D committee published our research agenda to demonstrate how research challenges relate to the NIPP. Together with these two publications, the necessary steps to produce a robust cyber secure platform was formed. Another vital asset of FSSCC is the Financial Services Information Sharing Analysis Center, or FS-ISAC. Our ISAC has been an effective information-sharing tool in the fight against cyber attacks. Every day our ISAC forwards cyber and physical security risk updates from over sources to over , sector participants. Our ISAC also shares this information with Treasury and law enforcement to help stop and prevent attacks. FSSCC and our ISAC have also been active participants in several business continuity exercises, including the congressionally mandated Top Off exercises. Additionally, ISAC represented FSSCC in Cyber Storm and Cyber Tempest, two exercises focused on cyber-related issues. Our ISAC is also helping us to plan for Cyber Storm II, which is scheduled for March . FSSCC believes exercise participation is critical, and we encourage the planners of these exercises to include the private sectors during the planning phases of these exercises. FSSCC has been an active participant in the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security, PCIS. I am a member of the executive committee and board of PCIS. PCIS has a working group focusing on cross-sector collaboration on cybersecurity issues. Many cybersecurity issues are ongoing and there are still several issues to address. Two issues relate to the GAO's SSP report and the DHS's R&D budget. According to GAO, the banking and finance sector SSP was ranked somewhat comprehensive in addressing cybersecurity. Because the GAO did not consult with the Treasury or FSSCC when preparing this report, I respectfully disagree with their conclusions. Our SSP included the research challenge document which fully addresses the GAO criteria for cybersecurity R&D. For example, our R&D committee is identified as the primary mechanism to solicit information on R&D initiatives; and the research challenges report details the sector's goals and gaps related to cybersecurity. Examples of the SSP in my written testimony contradict GAO's finding that we failed to identify the programs to detect, deter, respond, and recover from cyber attacks. The GAO report also stated our SSP failed to describe the process for R&D investment priorities, but the R&D committee clearly identified a number of priorities where investment dollars could be directed. Without further guidance, it is unclear how the GAO reached these conclusions. We will welcome a dialogue with GAO on these important issues. Finally, FSSCC believes DHS should consult with the private sector when funding private research. FSSCC thinks it makes good economic sense to fund R&D industry experts and to use those experts to achieve this goal. Greater communication and consulting is necessary between DHS, Treasury, and FSSCC. Another option would be to provide direct grant authority to the Treasury. Currently, FSSCC can only influence R&D projects through comment letters. In short, FSSCC believes that the DHS cybersecurity R&D budget should be more closely aligned with the level of threat. An appropriation of only $ million is clearly insufficient. Our Nation would be better served by providing additional budget discretion and dollars to projects identified by the industry under attack. Thank you for the opportunity to provide FSSCC's views for this important hearing. I would be pleased to answer any questions. [The statement of Mr. Hender follows:] Prepared Statement of George S. Hender Chairman Langevin, Chairwoman Jackson Lee, Ranking Members McCaul and Lungren, and members of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology and the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection of the House Homeland Security Committee, I am George Hender, Management Vice Chairman of The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which is the world's largest derivatives clearing organization.\ \ OCC is a leader in business continuity planning in the financial services sector and was a founding member of the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC) and ChicagoFIRST, a regional public/private partnership addressing homeland security and emergency management issues in the financial services industry. I am pleased to submit this statement on the very important topic of cybersecurity on behalf of FSSCC.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ OCC, founded in , was the first clearinghouse to receive a 'AAA'credit rating from Standard & Poor's Corporation.

Thus, I am the Chairman of FSSCC. Prior to my appointment, I served as FSSCC's Vice Chairman from September through May . Additionally, I am on the Executive Committee and Board of the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security (PCIS), which is the private sector organization that coordinates homeland security issues for all national critical infrastructures. I have also formerly served as Vice Chairman of the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC). This is the organization responsible for communicating key cyberspace, physical security, and Homeland Security information to the financial services sector. I applaud the Committee for holding today's hearing on such an important topic. Before I focus on measures taken by FSSCC related to cybersecurity, I would first like to discuss the important role the financial services sector has in our economy and the role FSSCC plays in improving the sector's resilience through safeguarding its critical infrastructure and employees. Introduction and Background The United States financial services sector is the backbone of the world economy. With United States assets estimated to be in excess of $ trillion,\ \ this large and diverse sector accounted for over $ trillion in gross domestic product (GDP) or . percent of total GDP.\ \ The sector is primarily owned and operated by the private sector whose institutions are extensively regulated by Federal and, in many cases, state government. In addition to these public sector entities, self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the National Futures Association (NFA), and exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), also play an important role in industry oversight. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ http://www.financialservicesfacts.org/financial /today/assets \ \ http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn /gdpbyind_data.htm --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Working together, the public and private sector regulators encourage a highly competitive market where identifying and managing a myriad of financial and nonfinancial risks is essential to success. Through numerous laws enacted by Congress over the past years, federal financial regulators have implemented a complex regime that includes examinations of the sector's institutions' operational, financial and technological systems. These examinations are designed to determine the extent to which an institution is addressing its financial and non-financial risks, such as Internet and information technology vulnerabilities. They also evaluate the adequacy of controls and applicable risk management practices at the institution. Public-Private Partnership Both the public and private sector financial services organizations recognize the importance of business continuity planning in preparing for catastrophic events; however, our sector's organizations know they will not operate as independent entities during a real crisis. Therefore, planning for these events should be done in a coordinated fashion. FSSCC was established at the request of the U.S. Treasury Department in response to Homeland Security Presidential Directive , which required sector-specific Federal departments and agencies to identify, prioritize and protect United States critical infrastructure and key resources. We are a private sector coalition of the nation's leading financial services firms and trade associations that are working to reinforce the financial services sector's resilience to terrorist attacks, man-made and natural disasters, and other threats, such as cyber attacks, facing the sector's critical infrastructure. FSSCC closely interacts with its Sector Specific Agency (SSA), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC), its public-sector counterpart.\ \ We also strongly support regional public/private partnerships, such as ChicagoFIRST and DFWfirst. These organizations address homeland security and emergency management issues on a local level, where many catastrophic events are primarily managed. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ The members of FBIIC are the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS); the Department of the Treasury; the Farm Credit Administration (FCA); the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB); the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; the Federal Reserve Board (Fed); the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC); the National Association of State Credit Union Supervisors (NASCUS); the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA); the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA); the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO); the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS); the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The combined efforts and close interaction of these groups with FSSCC fosters a spirit of cooperation within our sector that facilitates effective preparation for a critical event, such as a cyber attack. Equally important, this collaboration creates a streamlined approach to working with other sectors where cross-industry interdependencies exist. The financial services sector is very dependant on a number of other sectors, especially the energy, telecommunications and transportation sectors. At the beginning of my term as FSSCC Chairman, I personally met with representatives from nearly every FSSCC member to solicit their ideas on how to further strengthen the resilience of the financial services sector and reduce vulnerability to cyber threats, terrorist attacks, criminal or illegal activities, and man-made or natural disasters. These conversations, as well as the large number of formal and informal meetings taking place each year within FSSCC and between FSSCC and FBIIC, help show how our partnership model addresses threats and risks posed by the Sector's dependency upon other sectors. FSSCC's general meetings provide an example of this model. Here members meet and hear from critical sectors on which our sector heavily relies. They also provide a venue in which to coordinate and prioritize sector initiatives. Another example is the FSSCC working group which is working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop an emergency credential for FSSCC members' use in extraordinary emergencies. Development of such a credential is a priority reflected in our overall research plan. Just this last summer, the FSSCC credentialing working group participated in the cross-sector exercise known as ``Summer Breeze.'' This exercise validated the use of First Responder Authentication Credential (FRAC) identification cards. Arguably, the most important example of collaboration within the sector is the ongoing effort to plan for pandemic influenza. On October , , FSSCC and FBIIC completed the most comprehensive exercise ever held for the U.S. financial services sector. This important exercise focused on the response of the sector's members to pandemic influenza; over , financial firms participated. FSSCC understands that effective business continuity planning must envision and prepare for a diverse range of issues and threats. This is encompassed in our mission statement and goals. FSSCC's Mission and Goals FSSCC's mission is to foster and facilitate the coordination of sector-wide voluntary activities and initiatives designed to bolster critical infrastructure protection and homeland security. FSSCC strives to improve sector awareness of critical infrastructure protection issues, to promote information sharing on these issues, and to find opportunities for improved coordination throughout the sector. Through its efforts, FSSCC seeks to enhance public trust and confidence in the sector's ability to withstand and recover from significant disasters. Treasury, in close collaboration with FSSCC and FBIIC, completed the Banking and Finance Sector's Sector Specific Plan (SSP) \ \ in December . This plan, combined with the other critical infrastructure SSPs, helps form the overall National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). Our sector's SSP outlines a strategy for working collaboratively with public and private sector partners to identify, prioritize and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure. FSSCC believes DHS appropriately guides each critical infrastructure sector in coordinating their SSPs. However, each sector specific agency should retain control over SSP implementation. Also, DHS and each sector should view the SSPs as a starting point for developing a comprehensive, nationally-oriented, critical infrastructure regime. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ https://www.fsscc.org/reports/ /Bank_Finance_SSP_ .pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Banking and Finance Sector's SSP, including its Research and Development (R&D) appendices, outlines three sector-specific goals. First, the sector seeks to maintain its strong position of resilience, risk management and redundant systems, in the face of a myriad of intentional, unintentional, man-made and natural threats. Second, the sector aims to address and manage the risks posed by the sector's dependency on telecommunications, information technology, energy and transportation sectors. Lastly, the sector plans to continue to work with the law enforcement community, the private sector, and our international counterparts to increase available resources used to track and arrest criminals. Specifically, to track and arrest those persons responsible for crimes against the sector, including cyber attacks and other electronic crimes. The remainder of my testimony will focus on FSSCC's efforts in addressing these goals in light of protecting against cyber attacks and other electronic crimes. Specific Actions for Cybersecurity Modern financial services are built on a foundation of information technology, including computing hardware, software and telecommunications. This foundation is afflicted by multiple vulnerabilities and an increasingly high level of threats. Our sector's cybersecurity strategy seeks to address these threats by generally focusing on people, process and technology. Ensuring our sector has the brightest minds, most efficient processes and state-of-the-art technology to protect against cyber threats is our highest priority because our sector understands our entities' systems and networks are a target because ``that's where the money is.'' \ \ In addition, as September , , showed us, our sector is a focus of terrorists because of our iconic status.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ The members of FBIIC expend considerable effort to ensure the information security platforms serving as our industry's cornerstone are not compromised. In the case of financial institutions, federal examiners are often permanently located within the entity being reviewed. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is the primary federal interagency body empowered to develop uniform principles and standards for the examination of financial institutions. The FFIEC operates an Information Technology Council devoted to addressing cybersecurity issues, and its recommendations are incorporated into the FFIEC Handbook. Examiners use the Handbook to determine the extent to which the institution has identified its financial and non-financial risks, such as Internet and information technology vulnerabilities. Also, it is used to evaluate the adequacy of controls and applicable risk management practices at the institution. Additionally, the federal financial regulatory authorities issue numerous guidance documents and Financial Institution Letters (FILs) specifically related to cybersecurity. Similarly, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the securities SROs review the cybersecurity programs of exchanges, broker-dealers and clearing organizations as part of their ongoing supervisory exams and related activities. \ \ For many years, the culture of our sector has emphasized strong internal controls, physical and cybersecurity, and a comprehensive approach to business continuity planning that recognizes the importance of recovering and resuming business operations as swiftly as possible. Business continuity planning in our sector follows an ``all hazards'' approach that focuses on the impact of a disruption, rather than its cause, to ensure that high impact but low probability events are incorporated into the planning process. After September , the Fed, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and SEC issued the Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System (Sound Practices Paper), Securities Exchange Act Release No. (April , ). This paper identified stringent resumption or recovery objectives for core clearing and settlement organizations providing services for critical financial markets or acting as large payment system operators, and for firms that play significant roles in one or more critical financial markets. The Sound Practices Paper sets out an objective of recovering or resuming clearing and settlement activities within the business day on which a disruption occurs and maintaining geographically dispersed resources sufficient to meet those recovery or resumption activities. Last year, the agencies that issued the Sound Practices Paper reported to Congress that ``the core clearing and settlement organizations, which present the greatest potential risk to the operation of the financial system, have made significant investments in their operating infrastructures, and all have achieved substantial implementation of the sound practices.'' Joint Report on Efforts of the Private Sector to Implement the Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the resilience of the US. Financial System (April ). GAO has also examined the preparedness of these organizations in the light of the Sound Practices paper, and has found continuing progress in protecting our nation's financial system from a variety of threats, including cyber attacks. See Financial Market Preparedness: Significant Progress Has Been Made, But Pandemic Planning and Other Challenges Remain GAO- - (March ); Financial Market Organizations Have Taken Steps to Protect Against Electronic Attacks, But Could Take Additional Actions GAO- - R (June ): Financial Market Preparedness: Improvements Made, But More Action Needed to Prepare for Wide-Scale Disasters GAO- - (September ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our sector faces a number of cyber-related threats such as, hacking, virus dissemination, software piracy, identity theft, account fraud, phishing,\ \ spoofing,\ \ and pump and dump \ \ schemes. FSSCC's members have responded to these challenges aggressively. For example, FSSCC member organizations have prepared a document to help financial institutions develop and execute response programs when confidential and sensitive information is accessed or misused by unauthorized individuals. The Identity Theft Assistance Center, developed by a FSSCC member, provides a free victim assistance service and provides data about identity theft to law enforcement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ ``Phishing'' is a fraudulent scheme where an e-mail directs its recipients to Web sites where they are asked to provide confidential personal or financial information. Reports of phishing attacks have risen dramatically in the last year. \ \ ``Spoofing'' is an attempt to gain unauthorized system access by mimicking, impersonating or posing as an authorized user. \ \ ``Pump and Dump'' is a fraudulent scheme involving artificially inflating the price of a stock or other security through false or exaggerated promotion. Then the stock or security is sold at inflated prices. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The financial services sector has always placed itself on the cutting edge of cybersecurity initiatives. Our institutions were among the first to have Chief Information Security Officers as part of their management teams. Also, the sector was among the first to use various authentication tools to protect against internet fraud. Similarly, many financial institutions embrace the concept of layered security by using multiple intrusion detection and prevention products. Firms regularly work with technology companies to improve these products. Without such security measures in place, customers would hesitate to use on-line products which are a central component of a financial firm's business model. In addition to the threat to individual customers, our sector is also focused on cyber-related threats to our financial structure. The nature and complexity of attacks are growing more sophisticated. As a result, our sector works in close collaboration with the nation's intelligence community to address this concern. FSSCC R&D Committee Prior to the NIPP's issuance in June , FSSCC recognized cybersecurity as a critical issue and formed a standing R&D Committee. This committee was established to identify and prioritize areas of need, in which the most promising opportunities exist for research and development initiatives. These initiatives significantly improve the sector's critical infrastructure protection. The R&D Committee began developing a list of priorities in . In April , the committee published Research Challenges,\ \ a document which identifies eight R&D areas the sector needs to address.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \https://www.fsscc.org/reports/ / Research_Challenges_Booklet .pdf \ \ The eight R&D projects are: ( ) Secure Financial Transaction Protocol (SFTP); ( ) Resilient Financial Transaction System (RFTS); ( ) Enrollment and Identity Credential Management; ( ) Suggested Practices and Standards; ( ) Understanding and Avoiding the Insider Threat; ( ) Financial Information Tracing and Policy Enforcement; ( ) Testing; and ( ) Standards for Measuring ROI of CIP and Security Technology. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- An over-arching theme throughout our Research Challenges is securing the sector's information technology infrastructure to prevent intrusion from unauthorized sources. In October , the FSSCC R&D committee, with Treasury advising, demonstrated for DHS how FSSCC's Research Challenges related to the NIPP by publishing FSSCC's Research Agenda. Together these two publications provide industry, academia, and the public with a shared insight into the opportunities and requirements necessary to produce a robust cybersecurity platform. FS-ISAC The FS-ISAC is another vital asset to FSSCC and the sector. It was created on October , , as a means of meeting the sector's information-sharing obligation under the Presidential Decision Directive on Critical Infrastructure Protection.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ http://www.cybercrime.gov/white_pr.htm --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FS-ISAC channels information from more than sources to reach over , sector participants daily and promotes information sharing between the public and private sectors. The FS-ISAC provides sector-wide knowledge about cyber and physical security risks faced by the financial services sector. Specifically, FS-ISAC's incident alerts notify members about the type of attack, its origin, and suggested remedial action. FS-ISAC information allows members to immediately receive threat and vulnerability information; share vulnerabilities anonymously and communicate within a secure portal; access new data feeds of threat and vulnerability information; and access a wide range of user data from which users can produce their own reports and metrics. The FS-ISAC also uses this information to work with Treasury and law enforcement in helping to stop and prevent attacks. Two important government information sources for the FS-ISAC's / Security Operations Center are DHS's Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) and the U.S.-Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT). Relevant information from these data sources is monitored by the FS-ISAC and shared with trusted sector representatives through FS- ISAC's notification system and web portal. Then reports from FS-ISAC approved members are uploaded through the system. Both sources provide a valuable service to the FS-ISAC. FSSCC and the FS-ISAC continue to work with DHS to coordinate these reports into the sector's information sharing structure. The FS-ISAC has been an effective tool in the fight against cyber attacks. For example, in November , an FS-ISAC member detected an unusually large number of unauthorized log-in attempts against its systems and anonymously reported this information to the FS-ISAC. Soon after, the FS-ISAC issued an alert to its members. Later, five more financial institutions reported similar activity. This information sharing proved the financial institutions were under attack from a single source. While the attack was relatively insignificant in terms of its potential sector-wide impact, it demonstrates how the FS-ISAC's collaborative model can be an effective means to quickly deliver real- time information so financial institutions may be alerted to act against real threats. The FS-ISAC was effective once again this past August when it alerted several member banks of suspicious web-site activity. The FS- ISAC then helped to avoid compromise of several major money center and regional banking institutions user accounts.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ FS-ISAC discovered use of Torpig Trojans, which use malicious code designed to place themselves into on-line banking applications for the purpose of stealing user login IDs and passwords. These Trojans evade detection by disabling security warning messages. Then they log open window sessions to capture user log-on information which is sent back to the attacker. After discovering use of the malicious code on several members' web sites, FS-ISAC was able to issue an incident alert that led to the discovery and eradication of this Trojan on web sites both in the U.S. and overseas. Cyber Syllabus In May , the U.S. Department of Defense sought a private sector partner to help develop an undergraduate studies curriculum designed to provide exposure to information technology cybersecurity issues. FSSCC, through its R&D Committee, took the initiative to partner with the National Terrorism Preparedness Institute at St. Petersburg College in Florida to complete the project. I am pleased to report the syllabus was completed in May , resulting in an on-line training program that can be made available to all universities. Additionally, FSSCC is working to identify an educational institution capable of making this program available to our members at no cost. It is our hope this type of public-private collaboration will help to inspire a new generation of ideas and resources devoted to protecting our nation's cyber space. Handbook of Science and Technology for Homeland Security Another joint DHS/FSSCC initiative currently underway is the drafting of a handbook designed to educate researchers on the critical needs of the homeland security and intelligence communities. It will also promote interdisciplinary dialogue in those fields. I am pleased to report FSSCC is on target to provide this information to DHS by year's end. Also, this handbook should be distributed worldwide in online and print formats next year. Cybersecurity Exercises FSSCC and FS-ISAC have been active participants in several business continuity exercises, including the congressionally mandated TOPOFF exercises and a number of regional and national cybersecurity exercises. In February , FS-ISAC represented our sector in Cyber Storm, the first government-led, full scale cybersecurity exercise of its kind. Ten months later, in December , FS-ISAC participated in Cyber Tempest, an exercise devoted to testing a wide area of cyber issues from a regional perspective. Both of these exercises provided positive benefits to our sector's business continuity planning, such as developing better integration between FSSCC and the FS-ISAC. FSISAC is now involved in planning Cyber Storm II scheduled for March . These opportunities are a vital resource to leverage. We believe exercise leaders would benefit by increasing our level of involvement in future exercises. PCIS Working Group FSSCC has been an active participant in PCIS, which was formally recognized in the NIPP as the Private Sector Cross-Sector Council. PCIS is dedicated to coordinating cross-sector initiatives aimed at promoting public and private efforts to improve the security and safety of our nation's critical infrastructure. PCIS has established a working group focused on cross-sector collaboration of cybersecurity issues. Each Sector Coordinating Council must appoint a sector representative to participate on the working group. The FSSCC has selected FS-ISAC Chairman, Eric Guerrino, for this task. The PCIS working group is another example of how the financial services sector is following a collaborative model to develop a strong cybersecurity network. Future Challenges FSSCC has achieved a great deal over the past few years. However, there are still many issues which must be addressed regarding cybersecurity. Some of these issues have been highlighted in a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report entitled Critical Infrastructure Protection: Sector-Specific Plans' Coverage of Key Cybersecurity Elements Varies. Another less apparent, but equally important, issue includes increasing the level of consultation between DHS and its SSCs and SSAs over research and development initiatives. I will take a few moments to highlight each issue. GAO Report The GAO recently conducted a review of each SSP to determine if key aspects of cybersecurity related to the NIPP had been adequately covered. The GAO's preliminary results have found none of the plans fully addressed all cybersecurity related criteria. Consequently, the GAO recommends that DHS require all SSPs be amended to address all cyber-related criteria by September . Based on the cyber-related criteria established by GAO for its report, the GAO concluded the Banking and Finance Sector's SSP ``somewhat comprehensively'' covers cybersecurity. We respectfully disagree with the GAO's analysis. Because the GAO did not consult the SSAs or Sector Specific Councils when conducting its review, I would like to take this opportunity to explain our view on several areas the report concluded our SSP did not address. Under section seven of the report, GAO stated our sector's SSP failed to ( ) describe a process to solicit information on ongoing cyber R&D initiatives and ( ) identifies existing cyber-related projects that support goals and identifies gaps. The sector's SSP highlights the R&D committee as the primary mechanism to solicit information on R&D initiatives, and the R&D Committee's Research Challenges outlines in detail the sector's goals and gaps related to cybersecurity. Further, our sector's priority on R&D is evidenced by the establishment of the FSSCC R&D Committee in and publication of its Research Challenges in April , well before the NIPP was issued last year. FSSCC believes the SSP and the Research Challenges document, which was incorporated into the SSP in an appendix, adequately addresses the GAO's criteria. We welcome a dialogue with the GAO on this issue. Additionally, GAO's review stated, under section five, that our sector failed to identify programs to deter, respond, and recover from cyber attack. The Banking and Finance Sector SSP used a deter, respond and recover approach throughout all sections. Our testimony today highlights a number of initiatives mentioned in our SSP aimed at this very issue--the R&D Committee, FS-ISAC, Cyber Syllabus, Cyber Threat Exercises, and PCIS. Consequently, without further guidance from GAO it is unclear how they reached a conclusion that our sector completely failed to address this issue. The GAO report, under section eight, also stated our SSP failed to describe a process for investment priorities. Although FSSCC does not have any budget authority, we believe our R&D Committee's Research Challenges and Research Agenda highlight a number of priorities where investment dollars are most needed for our sector. FSSCC, FBIIC and Treasury worked in close collaboration to develop our SSP, which we believe memorializes past and current initiatives into a living document serving as a guide for future action. In other words, we agree with DHS's assessment that the SSPs ``represent only the early efforts by the sectors to develop their respective plans.'' Consequently, we welcome all comments and dialogue from interested parties on how to improve our nation's critical infrastructure protection regime and believe that our sector is a model for less regulated sectors with less mature cybersecurity plans. SSC/SSA R&D Budget FSSCC believes DHS should consult with the SSCs, and, at the very least, their SSAs, on business continuity research projects to ensure optimal resource allocation is taking place. FSSCC would like to encourage the Subcommittees and Congress as a whole to work with DHS to ensure the same collaborative model used in our sector to generate business continuity information and reports extends to actual resource allocation for critical infrastructure programs. Failure to consult with experts from the organizations representing each sector severely limits the ability to maximize returns from investment dollars in an efficient manner. Over the past few years, FSSCC and its members have devoted significant resources to generating information, developing plans, and identifying issues related to cybersecurity and opportunities for research for the public sector. While much information has been collected, FSSCC fears this information risks being lost in a ``black hole.'' To avoid this result, FSSCC seeks to work with its public and private partners to develop a formal program that would channel resources to areas and programs that would provide the most positive impact for our nation's critical infrastructure. FSSCC thinks that it makes good economic sense to channel available sector and public research resources to programs supporting the Research Challenges and Research Agenda developed by industry experts on FSSCC's R&D Committee. To achieve this goal, greater communication and consultation about opportunities for R&D spending is necessary between DHS, Treasury and FSSCC. Another option would be to provide grant authority to SSAs such as the Treasury Department. Currently, FSSCC is limited to influencing R&D project funding through support letters. Recently, FSSCC R&D Committee members visited Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) with a Treasury official to introduce CMU officials to the FSSCC R&D Agenda. While at CMU, the FSSCC R&D Committee reviewed CMU research projects that CMU judged to be of interest to the financial community. Committee members found that CMU projects focused on Operational Resiliency, Keystroke Pattern Analysis, Device-Enabled Authentication, and Insider Threat Analysis specifically addressed major FSSCC research challenges, as well as the corresponding NIPP research agenda themes. FSSCC could not fund these research projects but wrote letters of support to encourage funding from other sources. FSSCC believes the DHS cybersecurity R&D budget should be more closely aligned with the threat posed. Twelve million dollars appropriated for this purpose is insufficient to cover the R&D demands within DHS and throughout the critical infrastructure sectors. Our nation would be better served by providing additional budget discretion and dollars to those most closely aligned with the work to be performed. Conclusion The financial services sector has a long history of thoughtfully and carefully preparing for threats to its critical infrastructure and employees. The members of FSSCC are proud of our progress since our inception in staying abreast of new and unexpected threats to the critical infrastructure of the financial services sector. The financial services sector is working diligently to refine best practices, business continuity plans, and homeland security efforts to better protect employees and financial assets from cyber attacks. We are grateful for the collaboration and coordination with our public sector partners, the Department of the Treasury and the other members of FBIIC, as we develop these plans. We will continue to work diligently, and I am confident that the financial sector's preparation for cyber attacks will meet the high standards of planning for which our industry is well respected. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide FSSCC's views for this important hearing. I would be pleased to answer any questions. Mr. Langevin. I want to thank the witnesses for their testimony. And I remind each member that he or she will have minutes to question the panel. I now recognize myself for minutes for the purpose of questions. Mr. Hender, thank you for your testimony. You discussed the R&D piece of your sector plan and your information sharing and analysis center. What I didn't hear, though, is how your sector protects its assets and what efforts are under way in that respect. Would you address that? Mr. Hender. Certainly. As I indicated in my testimony, our ISAC on a daily basis, a daily basis, receives well over sources of independent information which it analyzes, and then passes on that analysis every day before the markets open. Mr. Langevin. That is information sharing. What about--what steps do you take? What concrete steps are you taking? Mr. Hender. Well, part of the information that is fed to the , participants is, in fact, potential cyber attacks. They then take that information and use that information to look at their systems to see whether they have vulnerabilities. Also, attacks take place and they are able to pass on to the other participants the attacks that are ongoing and how those attacks can be mitigated. We also use that information to pass on to the other government agencies to make sure that those attacks are taken seriously and the government agencies can use their best efforts to stop them. Mr. Langevin. I think, clearly, what would be helpful to this subcommittee, for better understanding of the situation, is more concrete steps--instead of action plans, steps that they actually take as opposed to just being notified and sharing information. What steps are then taken to make sure that the attacks are not successful and then security mechanisms are actually put into place? I would have felt more comfortable--you spoke about intrusion detection devices and other beefing up, fire walls and things of that nature. Mr. Hender. Clearly, the members of FSSCC spend billions and billions of dollars building just those things that you have mentioned to prevent the attacks. As we all know, these attacks are becoming more sophisticated every day, and the things that they have in place, which maybe were adequate a year ago or months ago, we now know are not. So they are continuously spending money to make sure that those fire walls and other protection devices are in place to stop an attack. When those protection things fail, it is very important to get that information out so it does not spread. Mr. Langevin. Secretary Garcia, let me turn to you on another topic. The White House has announced a few weeks ago a new initiative called the Cyber Initiative. It has been said that the Cyber Initiative will be a multi-year, multi-billion- dollar operation which will help protect government and private communication networks from cyber attacks. I have also heard that the DNI will be coordinating this effort with over , people from DHS, NSA and other Federal agencies. It is extremely disconcerting, however, that everything that I have heard about this new initiative has come from newspaper articles, despite repeated requests for a briefing from DHS. Why won't the Department brief this committee on the Cyber Initiative? Mr. Garcia. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. First of all, we take very seriously our commitment to inform and engage the Congress on matters as important as cybersecurity. And along those lines, we are glad that we have had the opportunity to brief members of the committee on more than one occasion on the classified threats that we are facing as a Nation, and particularly as a Federal Government. So the question becomes, then, what do we actually do about it? And this is--in fact, many of the issues that I have testified to you about we have a number of programs under way in DHS under my Office of Cybersecurity and Communications that are addressing this day after day. And one of the highest priorities that I stated at the outset of my tenure at the Department was to protect Federal networks, which are constantly under attack, cyber attack, on a day-to-day basis. So that has been well-stated as one of my highest priorities. In terms of making that a comprehensive, holistic Government program that involves all members of the Federal Government on an interagency basis, it is a complex plan in process. And we would want to be sure that we have an accurate assessment of the way forward before we brief the Congress on this. The last thing we want to do is give you an incomplete or fragmented strategy. Mr. Langevin. Well, Secretary Garcia, you know, I just remind you that this is supposed to be a collaborative effort, and both the administration working with the Congress. And when you are talking about the Cyber Initiative, something this massive, involving this many people, with the direct involvement potentially of the NSA, along with billions of dollars that are going to be spent, the lack of being forthcoming and engaging in a full disclosure with the Congress, particularly with this committee, subcommittee, it is very upsetting, it is disconcerting, and I am not happy. I am not satisfied with that answer. Now, according to an article in the Baltimore Sun, the Cyber Initiative calls for NSA to work with DHS and other Federal agencies to monitor critical infrastructure networks to prevent unauthorized intrusions. One presumes this would mean the monitoring of both Federal and privately owned critical infrastructure networks. If this is true, what impact will this have, this initiative have, on the cybersecurity elements of the sector- specific plans? And beyond that, what impact will this have on the public-private partnership that DHS has been developing? Mr. Garcia. Sir, certainly I wouldn't want to comment on an article that is speculative before we really finalize our plans. But we certainly look forward to briefing the committee at the appropriate time when we have finalized our plans. But let me tell you that everything that we have been doing over the past year and a half or years has been focused on this public-private partnership, and that needs to continue. My emphasis, absent the public-private partnership, is in strengthening our Federal networks. And that really is one of the highest priorities. And that is what we are focusing on here for the purposes of this hearing. The NIPP and the sector- specific plan process is one that we are committed to, year after year, as we involve the private sector in our efforts. Mr. Langevin. Mr. Secretary, I certainly look forward to getting that briefing on the Cyber Initiative at the earliest possible opportunity. With that, the Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. McCaul, for minutes. Mr. McCaul. I thank the Chair. And I would also like to raise the issue--we have had several hearings on cybersecurity. And, Secretary Garcia, you have participated in many of those. And it is my assumption that this plan that DHS is working on with the administration, you are in the process of developing that plan at this point in time? Is that correct? Mr. Garcia. That is correct, sir. It is an interagency process. Mr. McCaul. Right. When do you anticipate that the plan will be fully developed so that you will be in a position to brief Members of Congress? Mr. Garcia. Sir, I wouldn't want to commit to a time at this point. We are still in the planning stages. Mr. McCaul. Okay. Certainly, if it hasn't been finalized, I can see why it is an ongoing process at this point. But I would ask, as well as to echo the Chairman's remarks, that, to the extent when you are ready to share and coordinate with us on that, we certainly would like to know what the plan is. In addition, the commission that was formed as of yesterday I am sure will be very interested in working with you on that, as well. Mr. Garcia. Sir, let me just say I appreciate and commend you and Chairman Langevin for the appointment of that commission. I think this really shows proactive thinking about an ongoing attention that needs to be paid to cybersecurity and what is working, where are the gaps, what do we need to be doing, going forward. Mr. McCaul. And I thank you for saying that. I think as the Chairman mentioned yesterday, we see it as a forward-looking vehicle, not a ``gotcha'' exercise. It is a policy exercise, looking forward, what can we do to better protect our systems. And I think you will find it should be a very friendly, not hostile, relationship with the Department of Homeland Security and the administration. Having said that, I think as you mentioned, Secretary, the of , as I look at the report card, is actually some good news, that we have plans that are satisfactory. There are a few that are not. And, Mr. Powner, I want to ask you about some of those, specifically the financial sector, which has some concern. If the financial networks were hacked into and the numbers were moved on the ledger, you can imagine the economic chaos that would cause. And we know that, whether they are criminal enterprises wanting to steal or whether it would be terrorists that would like to cause economic devastation in this country, you can imagine the consequences. So this particular sector is of some concern. Mr. Hender has raised the issue that your review is not as thorough as it should have been on the financial sector, and I want to get your response on that. He specifically said you did not consult with Treasury on your analysis. Can you comment on that? Mr. Powner. Yes, a couple comments. First of all, I would like to start by saying, do we think, based on our years of work looking at cyber critical infrastructure, that the banking and finance sector is one of the mature sectors? We do. Okay. When we did our analysis, we were surprised, okay. The way we go about our analysis, I have a team that has actually looked at this for many years, and we had multiple folks where they independently came up with the same assessment. Okay. So we stand by our assessment. I think Secretary Garcia mentioned that our assessment overall was consistent with his assessment. So I think there is a disagreement not with just GAO but perhaps with the DHS. Now, going forward, I am more than willing to sit down with Mr. Hender. We have talked about this, and we will talk about the differences here. I think the larger question here is this--not to go over checkmarks in this category or this category when you look at --is, what is the value of the plans? Okay. Some mature sectors--and it wasn't the banking and finance sector, but in other work we have done, the water sector, for instance, has mentioned, we are beyond the planning phase; these plans are not that helpful for us. And my only question is whether that is similar with the banking and finance sector. Mr. McCaul. Are you questioning the necessity for the plans or the---- Mr. Powner. Well, I think as you heard from the two witnesses here, there is a lot going on, on an individual company basis. And when you look at the whole sector approach, we have been trying to do this well prior to the, you know, / , the Homeland Security Act. This goes back to a Presidential directive in . Okay. So we are almost years into this, and many would argue that we haven't made much progress. We are still in the planning and assessing phase, and we ought to be into the protecting and putting in place robust recovery plans. So I am not saying that the plans necessarily aren't useful, because they could be useful. It is a question of whether we complete them and effectively implement them going forward. Mr. McCaul. Just to follow up to that, what more needs to be done to the financial sector to put it in the passing category? I am of the view that mandates and regulatory actions should be a last resort, that we should allow the private sector to work with the public to work this out. What more, in your opinion, needs to be done? Mr. Powner. Well, in order to get their plan more comprehensive, I think there are probably only six or seven criteria that they could easily bump their plan up and they would be one of the most comprehensive. So it is matter of just making the plan complete at this point. And do we have confidence that will occur? Yes. And we are more than willing to sit down with Mr. Hender, too, to make sure we didn't miss anything. But, once again, we stand by our analysis. Mr. McCaul. Last question. My time has expired, but I would like to ask Mr. Hender, how vulnerable, in your opinion, is the financial sector to a cyber attack? Mr. Hender. Well, I would never sit here and tell you that a cyber attack could not happen against our sector, but I don't want to leave the impression with this committee that we are still in the planning phase in terms of cyber. I think if the GAO had looked at our full plan and the appendices that were attached to that plan, and if they would have understood that we are way beyond the planning stage--we are a highly regulated industry. And back in , there was an analysis done by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the SEC to see what progress our sector had made not only in physical but also in cyber. And I will tell you, I would like to submit for the record the results of their findings, because I think you will find, if you read that report, we are way beyond the planning stage. We have done an enormous amount of work to protect this sector, so that if it is a cyber attack or a physical attack, we are in as good of shape as we think we can be. That is not to say you can't be better, but we work at it every single day to try and get better. Mr. McCaul. And what is the name of the report you mentioned again? Mr. Hender. The name of the report is the ``Joint Report on Efforts of the Private Sector to Implement the Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System,'' and is dated April . Mr. McCaul. Mr. Chairman, I would respectfully request that report be entered into the record. Mr. McCaul. I see my time has expired. Thank you. Mr. Langevin. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pascrell, for minutes. Mr. Pascrell. Did I hear you right, Mr. Hender, that the GAO did not take into account the appendix of the report? Mr. Hender. That is my impression. I don't know that for a fact. Because if you look at the appendix, it really answers the questions where they found fault with our sector. Mr. Pascrell. Mr. Powner, did you take into account the appendix? Mr. Powner. I would have to go back and revisit the full plan. A lot of these plans are quite comprehensive. Was there an appendix, or the one that Mr. Hender was referring to? I would have to look at that. Mr. Pascrell. When you are looking at the chart, you are looking at the chart that you presented to us, the five areas that need, really, some improvement and are still perhaps in the planning stage, as you go back before / , this process started, correct, Mr. Powner? Mr. Powner. That is correct. Mr. Pascrell. We are talking about banking and finance, defense industrial base, national monuments, agriculture, food and commercial facilities are the worst. Aren't they? Mr. Powner. Correct. Mr. Pascrell. Why is agriculture and food the worst, one of the worst? Specifically? Mr. Powner. Specifically? I could go through in detail, you know, those areas. Mr. Pascrell. I read your testimony. Mr. Powner. Right. Mr. Pascrell. But you know that off the top of your head. What stands out? Is there any one thing that stands out? Mr. Powner. I would have to get back to you on that. I mean, we have details here in an appendix for each of the criteria that we looked at, but clearly when you look at that, with as many categories that were not fully satisfied, there are eight overall categories, you know, do you have---- Mr. Pascrell. Right. Mr. Powner. --do you have a methodology to assess your assets? Do you have a methodology to perform your risk assessments? There be would be weaknesses in all those. Are there appropriate methodologies for recovery plans? Mr. Pascrell. Might not the biggest problem be here, to go back to something stated earlier, that we do not have a national risk assessment? What is the relationship between that, Mr. Powner, and the results which you have come up with, in your estimation? Mr. Powner. A national cyber risk assessment? Mr. Pascrell. Right. Mr. Powner. Well, one of the things that is clear is we have never had a national cyber threat assessment. Okay. So we have not had that. Mr. Pascrell. Ten years into the plan, and we don't have a risk assessment. Mr. Powner. Correct. Mr. Pascrell. All right. Let me ask Mr. Hender this question. Nothing changes under the sun. How are you verifying what companies are doing with the information you provide? How do you know what they are doing with it? You are not just sending information, you are not just sending out an advisory. This is serious business, as you well know better than I do. So what are you doing with the information? What are the companies doing with the information you give them? Mr. Hender. Well, I have talked to the companies. And depending upon the threat level, the company either has a problem or doesn't have a problem. Mr. Pascrell. Do we have a list of what is done? Do we have a report to present to this committee as to what these companies are doing with the information that is provided? Mr. Hender. I think if you look at the report that I referred to earlier---- Mr. Pascrell. Right. Mr. Hender. ----that report is very comprehensive. And it also deals with the companies that make up the sector. And I think the agencies that regulate them--I mean, we are highly regulated. These regulatory agencies---- Mr. Pascrell. You are highly regulated about--what things are you talking about? Mr. Hender. We are highly regulated by a number of things, but cyber is one of the things that we are regulated by. Mr. Pascrell. And how are you regulated? Mr. Hender. We are regulated by examination. And, in fact, in some of the large companies, the regulators sit right in the offices to make sure that the things that you are worried about don't happen. Mr. Pascrell. So you think the assessment that was made by GAO is just a result of them not reading all the information that should be available and is available to them? If they read that information, they are going to change their assessment, they are going to change the report. They are going to send back a report to this committee and say, ``Oh, we missed three or four different things, and we really want to change the banking and financial assessment to comprehensive. We don't think they are somewhat comprehensive; they are comprehensive.'' Is that what you want us to believe? Mr. Hender. I truly believe that. And I think our sector coordinating agency, the United States Treasury, truly believes that. I believe that we are one of the most mature sectors that are out there. We take this very seriously. Mr. Pascrell. No one is saying that you are not taking it seriously. You have been on this for years. Mr. Hender. And we-- Mr. Pascrell. Excuse me. You have been on this for years, and I am not convinced, in what I have read and what I have heard today--I am asking you to convince me. You haven't so far; you might. I am asking you to convince me that there have been tangible actions on your part, not you personally, but in that sector, that would indicate that we have come a long way. I don't feel that. What am I missing? Mr. Hender. Maybe I am just not a good communicator. Mr. Pascrell. No, I don't think that is the case at all. You have to have something to communicate. Mr. Hender. I think the amount of money that the firms have spent since / in making our sector more robust and able to deal not only with the physical threats but the cyber threats are very, very impressive. As I said, they take this very seriously. Our regulators take it very seriously. And I think that I would be surprised if the GAO, when we have our conversation and point to them the real efforts--not plans, but the real things that we have in place to protect this sector--would not change their opinion. I would be very surprised. Mr. Pascrell. Well, in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, we are years into this, with this particular sector, and there is a very serious statement that Mr. Hender has made, that we respectfully disagree with the GAO's analysis. Those are your words, Mr. Hender. And I respect those words. Don't get me wrong. I am more inclined, at this point-- not you personally--I am more inclined to believe GAO, because they have a different part of this. They are involved in a very different part of this than you may be or I may be. And I would hope that you will prove to them that they are wrong and so that this committee will get the report back, and maybe I will change my mind, or maybe some of the other committee members who feel like I do will change their mind. But going back to what Mr. Powner said, we need a national risk assessment plan. And we cannot be honest with the American people about how safe they are unless we have that plan. And that plan is overdue, is it not, Mr. Powner? Mr. Powner. Yes, it is. Mr. Pascrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your giving me those courtesies. Mr. Langevin. I appreciate the gentleman's line of questioning. His point is well-taken, and the Chair certainly agrees. With that, the Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Lungren, for minutes. Mr. Lungren. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me ask both Mr. Hickey and Mr. Hender this. It seems to me that the nature of your industries are such that the cyber world is an essential part of it, an obvious, central part of it. It is part of what you do. It is part of what you are. It is part of how you provide your services. As opposed to some other sectors where cyber is important, extremely important, but it is not so transparent to the user that if you were to charge them for protecting the cyber aspect of their business the user would say, ``Well, I understand that,'' in your industry it seems to me to be far more obvious. So I would ask you this, in both cases. How do your respective industries view cyber protection as a part of the cost of doing business, such that your members can justify to your shareholders the bottom line? Because I happen to think that that is one of the most important things we are going to have to do in the private arena. And it would seem to me it would be more obvious in both of your cases to begin with. So I would say these may be the easy cases. But can you give me an idea of how the companies that make up your organizations view that as part of cost of doing business and, therefore, part of the cost of being active competitors? Mr. Hickey. I think when you take a look at today's marketplace, our customers--which are enterprise customers, Government customers, and consumers--are demanding that companies like Verizon put in place safeguards to protect their business and their livelihoods within our organization. So the market is demanding that companies like Verizon invest, and invest very heavily, in technologies that will safeguard not just our physical assets and certainly our human assets but, very importantly, our cybersecurity assets. Mr. Lungren. Let me ask you this, then. You can look at a whole array of potential attacks. They could be hackers. They could be mischievous college students. They could be the bad guys who want to be able to get into your company and therefore extract some economic benefit on their part or to harm you so that someone else is benefitted. Those, it seems to me, are, in terms of possibilities, greater than a terrorist attack, which has greater consequence but the likelihood is far less. How do you calculate that such that you make a judgment to either insulate your operation from a cyber attack by a terrorist organization, transnational or national, or to create redundancies in the event that they are successful with an attack? Mr. Hickey. I think if we continue to focus on the blocking and tackling of cybersecurity practice, given the environment, given the fact that we are looking at an all-hazards environment, that we will continue to invest as necessary in the technology and the expertise to help secure the interests of our customers. Verizon in invested over $ billion in infrastructure build-out. And we are doing that certainly with an eye to our customer and our future customer base. And vendors that do business with Verizon know very clearly what our priorities are, in terms of the technologies that we require to make our network more secure going forward. So, again, going back to the marketplace, we are mindful of our customers' needs; our vendors are mindful of our needs as a major carrier. And companies like Verizon continue to invest very aggressively to make sure that we are addressing all hazards within the cybersecurity realm. Mr. Lungren. I would say parenthetically, if Verizon were one of those companies that we asked to assist us after / on our efforts on foreign intelligence that we are now refusing to give immunity, it is kind of tough for us to tell you to trust us as we go forward. Hopefully, we will address that. Let me ask both of you--and I know I asked both questions to you as well, Mr. Hender, but I am limited in time. Do you have, in the private sector, among the companies that would receive information that would be of value to them from the Government, do you have or do those companies have their people that have the proper clearances that they could receive that information? And is it at the CIO level? And if a CIO has that information, has that clearance, how does the CIO interact with the CEO if the CEO doesn't have that clearance? And what have we done in terms of recommendations, if any, in your sectors to deal with that? Mr. Hender. I think our sector--Specific agency, Treasury, has been very responsive in getting the right people in our sector the necessary clearances that we need and, in addition to that, giving us access to the people in the Federal Government who are charged with collecting the intelligence information and passing that information on to us. You ask a very important question, though. And that is, what can the person who has the clearance do with that information? Clearly, if there is a life-threatening event that is going on that is classified, that person has an exemption and can pass that information on to anyone to make sure that those lives are not lost. Also, that person, with the permission of the agency, can work and make sure that the appropriate people within that company or within that entity know what is going on to protect that entity. It has never really been a challenge, to date, where something has come to our attention that has been classified where we have not been able to use that information to protect the sector. Mr. Lungren. Mr. Hickey, you feel the same way? Mr. Hickey. Our sector-specific agency is the National Communications System. And just as Mr. Hender said, the NCS has been very attentive to the needs of not just my company but others, in making sure we have the right clearances for the right individuals. I can say that, from a Verizon standpoint, our CEO, Ivan Seidenberg, has just received his top-secret clearance. So, right to the top within our organization. If we, at the ground level, if my team becomes aware of information shared within the NCS or, you know, within the HITRAC organization, within the IP division, we can share that at the very highest levels of the business with the appropriate individuals to make the right decisions, from a response standpoint. Mr. Lungren. Thank you. Mr. Langevin. I thank the ranking member. The Chair now recognizes the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection for minutes. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much. And I thank the witnesses. And I am having trouble with double appointments and hearings that we have responsibility for, but I am delighted that the testimony has contributed to, I think, a very important discussion. I am going to start on this debate that is going on with the initial offering to work with the private sector. Again, the private sector holds percent of the infrastructure. And, certainly, cybersecurity being a seamless part of that, there is a dialogue going on about the question of the voluntary cooperation, which I made mention of in my opening remarks, or a regulatory framework. So I would like to ask Mr. Hender, based upon your experience--let me pose the question first to Mr. Powner, and then, Mr. Hender, you might want to comment. But based upon your experience in critical infrastructure work, protection work, do you think the Department of Homeland Security should continue to work with the private sector, or providing the private sector with an adequate value proposition to encourage it to effectively protect critical infrastructure? In essence, are we giving them enough of a carrot to do it voluntarily, or should there be some form of a regulatory framework in this partnership? Mr. Powner? Mr. Powner. I think when you look at what was envisioned in national policy going back pre-HSPD- , one of the things that the Federal Government needs to do a better job--and Assistant Secretary Garcia and I have talked about this--if there were more products, analytical products coming out of the US-CERT, more information on national threat information that was of value to the critical infrastructure owners, I think that would improve the partnership. Okay. So in order to have an effective partnership, you have to be offering something that these sectors want. Okay. Historically, when you look at where it has really worked, I think there were times when we provided grants to the water sector to do vulnerability assessments. That opened up the communications, okay, because the Government was paying for certain vulnerability assessments, so they were more inclined to open the discussion. I think there are pockets of sectors, due to the maturity of them working in regulated environments, that are more mature and have worked more effectively together, like the banking and finance sector. So I think regulation should be considered if we don't make more progress. But there is also--if you stay the course with the NIPP and the sector plans, the Federal Government needs to offer more and provide more of a service to the infrastructure owners. Ms. Jackson Lee. And that is service in what form? Mr. Powner. The service--the things that the Government controls more, when you look at the roles and responsibilities of the NCSD under Assistant Secretary Garcia, is threat information and it is analytical products on vulnerabilities and incidents. Okay. We have a US-CERT that we continue to attempt to build out capability with the vision that we are going to have more robust analytical products that we can provide to these infrastructure owners. As an example, if you go to DOD or some parts of the intelligence community, you will see some fairly robust analysis and warning capability, when it comes to cyber. Okay? So there are pockets in the Federal Government where we have this. All right? What we need to do is we need to build that out and transfer that information to the infrastructure owners. That would help with the partnership. Ms. Jackson Lee. And the pockets in the Federal Government are just scattered, or there is some order to them? Mr. Powner. I think there is order, but it depends on where it is at. If you look at DOD and some of their capabilities in this area, some of it is fairly robust. Ms. Jackson Lee. We need to harness it. We need to get some sort of organized way of connecting. Mr. Powner. Absolutely. If you look at HSPD- and if you go back to analysis and warning pre-DHS, we had this capability, and we were building it within the FBI. There was something there called the National Infrastructure Protection Center. With the creation of DHS, we moved it from the FBI and it now became the US-CERT. So, clearly, we have had some starts and stops. We have progressed forward; we have taken some steps backward. But if we really want to build out that capability, that is one way to build a more effective partnership, if you offer more on the Government side that was of value to these sector owners. Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me, Mr. Hender---- Mr. Hender. It is very clear that, unless there is a partnership between the private sector and the public sector, the things that we have discussed today are never going to be solved. I think a good example and a model is to look at the partnership that we have with Treasury. It is so critical to have information that flows both ways. And if I could make a recommendation, I would think it would work very well and be very important to take people from the private sectors, just not our sector but all the sectors, and house them in some form or fashion within CERT or some other intelligence organizations, so, as this information comes in, it can be analyzed, not only by the Government, but you have the private sector sitting there and saying, ``This is important information. This is a threat. This is what this means, this information.'' Unless you have that partnership and unless you have those people sitting there working together, a lot of information that maybe flows into these intelligence organizations, I think we are missing a golden opportunity. And I think we are missing it. Ms. Jackson Lee. We are missing it. Mr. Garcia--Mr. Chairman, if I can, I just have a couple of quick questions, probably not quick on the answers. Secretary Garcia, let me thank you for your service. This is a tough business that we are in. And I think there are some tough concerns that we have as members. You know that I expressed my concern about the national annual report regarding the status of critical infrastructure protection nationally and within each of the sectors. The report is due on November th. And my question is, is it ready? Is it something that we can expect? And you might want to acknowledge whether this is still the case, that we will have a full report. And I have another question for you that I would like to just offer so that you can answer it. The incident at the Idaho laboratory provided you with an opportunity to showcase how effectively you can reach out to the private sector with best practices. My concern, though, is how you verify the implementation of these advisories. And I think this was mentioned by one of the witnesses. How do we have a two-way street? How are you measuring such implementation? And into what obstacles are you running, so that the private sector can become vested in what you do? Mr. Garcia. Absolutely. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. On the first point, I believe we are on track for delivering that report to you. And on the second issue, you are correct that one of the most important things for us to achieve over time is the ability to measure progress. Where DHS is not empowered to compel reporting back from the private sector on the extent to which they have implemented best practices or other---- Ms. Jackson Lee. DHS is not compelled to report back to the private sector? Mr. Garcia. No, to the extent that DHS cannot compel the private sector to report back to DHS. Ms. Jackson Lee. To report back. So there is a lack of either oversight or regulatory structure. Mr. Garcia. Right. And for those sector coordinating councils that we have worked with, for example, they, in turn, are not necessarily empowered to demand from their member companies that they report back to them. So, much of this is, in fact, voluntary. I would point out, I think the fact that, through this whole NIPP process and the sector-specific plan process, the fact that there are critical sectors that have come to the table with DHS and other sector-specific agencies without actually being compelled to do so is, I think, in fact, a testament to the importance that the entire private sector, sector-specific agencies give to this issue of the joint public-private partnership. Ms. Jackson Lee. Quickly, Mr. Hickey, has the DHS given enough incentives to the business community to do what Mr. Garcia says is missing, which is to come back and report back on best practices? Apparently, there is a schism there, in terms of being able to do this in a voluntary manner. Mr. Hickey. I would respond to that by saying that there are a great number of forums that companies like Verizon participate in, from the National Security Telecom Advisory Committee to the President, where you have companies coming together from a full array of sector participants, that come together regularly to develop plans and policy and recommendations to the President on global infrastructure resiliency, on network security, on GPS issues, on a full array of issues where we feel an obligation to bring our subject- matter expertise to the table to work with Government and support Government initiatives. The NSIE, the National Security Information Exchange, where Government and industry come together, again, it is voluntarily, but willingly, to share best practice around cybersecurity and other security practice. My sense is that companies like Verizon are there because we feel an obligation to Government and to the country to participate not only in planning but in operationalizing security practice to protect the country's best interests. So we are there willingly. I think, from an incentive standpoint, the issue of real- time sharing of threat intelligence is very important. And that is helpful for companies like Verizon, to have a good, accurate source of timely information regarding threats, cybersecurity and otherwise, that we can then internalize and deal with from an operational standpoint. Within Assistant Secretary Garcia's organization, he has made, I think, a positive move toward bringing together, even more closely, the information-technology sector and the communications sector by collocating our NCC ISAC, our National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications ISAC, with the IT ISAC and with the US-CERT. That brings us closer together, physically, day in and day out. We can address, as things evolve, operational issues much more quickly on a day-to-day basis. So threat intelligence would be a major incentive, but I think there is a real willingness there to assist our Government partners. And we are, I think, continuing to move in the right direction. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. I think we have a lot of work that we can look at that you have done that we need to do. Thank you. Mr. Langevin. I thank the gentlelady. There is a vote on right now, but we will go to Ms. Clarke for the final question before we dismiss this panel. Ms. Clarke is recognized for minutes. Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. This question is to Mr. Powner. You just suggested to Chair Jackson Lee that the Federal Government could assist these sectors to ensure greater consistency through partnership, if you will. Clearly, there is a lack of consistency in the quality of the various sector- specific plans. Do you feel that DHS is doing enough to work with each respective set of public-private stakeholders to ensure greater consistency? And have your offices recommended or determined a good way for them to do this? Mr. Powner. Well, clearly, Assistant Secretary Garcia had mentioned his office and the interaction they had with various sectors in putting those plans together. I think what is important is, when you look at this next annual report that is due out, the annual report should be providing some assurance, Madam Chairwoman, that you mentioned, that, one, the plans are now complete and, two, that we are actually moving down the road toward implementation. Ms. Clarke. Mr. Garcia, Assistant Secretary Garcia, good to see you again. In response to Representative Pascrell's questioning, Mr. Powner said that there needs to be a national risk assessment for cybersecurity. Five months ago, the Department stood up the Risk Management and Analysis Division. Have you engaged with that office to date? Mr. Garcia. That is part of the National Protection and Programs Directorate, to which my office belongs as well. CS&C is part of that, as well as the Risk Management Analysis Office. So, yes, we interact regularly. The national risk assessment that we are focusing on is, in fact, the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, the sector- specific plans that go with it. And I think, as we implement these plans, as Mr. Powner says, we are going to have a national risk assessment with metrics in place that we can measure how well we are doing. I would emphasize that it is important to note that this is the first time we have done this, that sectors, industry sectors, have organized themselves around a common mission, and then to organize themselves to interact with the Government in a collaborative process, a framework by which we are going to measure the vulnerability, assess the vulnerability of our infrastructure nationwide, and then take the steps to actually mitigate those vulnerabilities and strengthen our infrastructure. So I think we have come a long way in just a year-and-a- half worth of time. And the fact that most of these sector- specific plans were written around the middle of last year, there has been a tremendous amount of effort and resources put into infrastructure protection since then in the cyber area. Ms. Clarke. Assistant Secretary, I recognize that, you know, this is a major, major undertaking, and some would say just putting together the Department of Homeland Security has been a major, major undertaking. The concern is that there be some sort of a driving force that puts some, you know, some energy behind getting this done in a timely fashion, and that we are not sort of leaving it up to inertia to get us there. You know, with each passing day, people are concerned that we have, you know, the critical infrastructure, particularly with respect to cybersecurity, in place. Because it seems like there is a generation of intelligentsia out there that just lives to get ahead of us, with respect to cyberspace. So I hope that you will certainly recognize the urgency from which you hear this committee speaking, because we certainly believe time is of the essence but, at the same time, understand that haste can make waste. So we hope you will take that under advisement. And this question is--really, my final question is to anyone on the panel. Although there are many differences between each sector represented in the NIPP and there is merit to the idea that each area tailor its own plan, when it comes to cybersecurity, many of these sectors deal with some of the same problems. For example, organizations of every sector have to deal with the possibility of data theft or that systems can be brought down. Therefore, if planners in one sector figure out a useful solution that can apply to other sectors, it would be useful if this information were disseminated. Is there any information-sharing occurring between the coordinating councils for each sector? And is this a role that DHS plays or could play? Mr. Garcia. Absolutely, Congresswoman. Thanks very much for that question. We, last May, set up--my office set up the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Working Group. And it is composed now of experts in cybersecurity from all of the sectors. And we meet at least monthly and, I think, more frequently on conference call. And this is the forum precisely for those various sectors to share their experiences in cybersecurity and see where there are dependencies on one another in their cyber infrastructure and interdependencies, and see where are there are common problems across all of them. Control systems, a subject that this committee held a hearing on on October th, is a prime example, where there is a nexus between cybersecurity and physical security. That the process control systems that enable us to purify water, manufacture chemicals, to run the electric grid, all of these digital control systems have a nexus to information networks or communications networks. And so, the fact that these sector representatives are coming together on a regular basis to share those concerns, identify common vulnerabilities, this is taking us a long way down the track of doing that national risk assessment that we are heading toward. And I think this is a perfect example of how the sector- specific plans, the NIPP process, is working. Ms. Clarke. You want to say anything? Mr. Hickey. I would just like to comment that the Communications Sector Coordinating Council and the IT Sector Coordinating Council work very closely together, day in and day out. We have cross-membership. We work together in a number of forums. Actually, the chair of the IT Sector Council is in today's audience. So there is a very close relationship. As was pointed out earlier by one of your colleagues, it is hard to distinguish where pure providers end and information service providers start. Companies like Verizon and other companies, large and small, are aware of the fact that, with convergence of technologies, cybersecurity has to remain a real focus. And I can assure you that, both within the IT sector and com sector, we work very, very closely together. Mr. Hender. I would just like to comment that we just finished a -week pandemic exercise. Part of the component of that exercise was cyber, because if the Internet is not there, then the work-at-home programs that the firms have put together are going to be useless. It is our intention to make those findings public in , early in , not only to our sector, but to all the sectors in this country and to the international countries that are interested in learning the experiences we had during this pandemic exercise. Ms. Clarke. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Langevin. I thank the gentlelady. And I thank the witnesses for their testimony. There is one last thing I am going to pose. Unfortunately, we don't have time for the answer since there is a vote on right now. We have about minutes. But, you know, when we talk about the risk assessment-- Secretary Garcia, I would ask you to respond to this in writing. And, Mr. Powner, if you would comment. You know, a risk assessment is composed of threat and vulnerability and consequence. You know, how will the national report be a risk assessment, when it is lacking these critical issues? So I pose that to you. And we will have some other questions that we would like you to respond to in writing. Again, I thank the witnesses for their valuable testimony, the members for their questions. The members of the subcommittee, as I mentioned, may have additional questions for the witnesses, and we ask that you respond expeditiously in writing to those questions. At this time, the first panel of witnesses is dismissed. And the Chair now recesses for what will be one vote, and we will reconvene in approximately minutes. Thank you. [Recess.] Mr. Langevin. The committee will come to order. As we call up the second panel of witnesses, I want to thank the panel for your patience and willingness to stick around. We do appreciate it, and I know you have valuable testimony to offer. Unfortunately, Mr. O'Hanlon was not able to stick around. He was going to be on this panel as the lead-off. Mr. O'Hanlon specializes in U.S. national security policy and is the co- author of a book called Protecting the Homeland , , and he would have been discussing one of his articles in that book. But he has submitted a statement for the record, and we will certainly forward look forward to reviewing that and hearing from Mr. O'Hanlon on a later date. In the meantime, of course, we are very grateful for the rest of our panel being here. Our first witness will be Ms. Sally Katzen, faculty member of the George Mason School of Law and a senior consultant to the Critical Infrastructure Protection Program at George Mason University. We thank you, Ms. Katzen, for being here. Our next witness is Mr. Larry Clinton, president of the Internet Security Alliance. We are grateful for you being here as well, Mr. Clinton. And our next witness, the last witness is Dr. Larry Gordon, Ernst & Young Alumni Professor Managerial Accounting Information Assurance at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. Dr. Gordon is also an affiliate professor with the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies. Mr. Langevin. Again, we want to thank you for being here. Without objection, the witnesses' full statements will be inserted into the record. And I now ask each of the witnesses to summarize their statement for minutes, beginning with Ms. Katzen. And before I turn the floor over to, Ms. Katzen, I understand that it is your anniversary today. Let me take the prerogative as Chair to wish you a happy anniversary, and thank you for spending your anniversary with us today. Ms. Katzen. My husband thanks you as well. Thank you. Mr. Langevin. I don't know if that was sincere or not. He may question it as well. Thank you. STATEMENT OF SALLY KATZEN, GEORGE MASON SCHOOL OF LAW, SENIOR CONSULTANT TO THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION PROGRAM, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY Ms. Katzen. Chairman Langevin, Chairman Jackson Lee, Ranking Members McCaul and Lungren, other distinguished members of the subcommittee. My background and qualifications and the credentials of the George Mason Law School CIPP program are set forth in the written testimony. Given the lateness of the hour, I want to condense my oral comments to the bare essentials. First point. You have heard it before, but it cannot be overemphasized. One of the problems that we have had with cyber CIPP is that for too long and in too many places, both in the private sector and in government, the task of identifying and addressing cyber CIPP risks has been confined to those in the enterprise that own, operate, maintain the computers, the servers, the networks. In other words, the IT department. But viewing cybersecurity as an IT problem with an IT solution greatly understates the problem and misperceives the solution. As we explain in the written testimony, even the best technical defenses are no better than the physical security and personnel security elements that must accompany them. And not only are these elements typically outside the direction and control of the IT department, but also they like the IT department typically fall on the operations side of the enterprise which generally is not well represented at the highest levels of corporate accountability and governance. Based on the extensive work that the CIPP program at GMU has done, we are impressed with what is called the ERM, the Enterprise Risk Management program. The emphasis in ERM is on the enterprise as a whole and raising cyber CIPP issues to the highest corporate level of accountability. And we have got a lot of discussion in our written testimony about how it works and what it does. I hope you like the cowboy graphic. Second point. Six years and billions of dollars since / , how much progress have we made? Now, the headlines from the GAO study say of the SSPs have comprehensively addressed the cybersecurity criteria. We think that may be an overly rosy summary if you look at the individual cyber criteria, plan by plan and sector by sector. In the written testimony, we highlight section of the GAO criteria, which speaks to the measures of progress. And in that connection, the representative from GAO in the earlier panel said, well, we are passed the plans. We are now into implementation. Fine. In fact, good. But if you don't have quality metrics to establish benchmarks at the outset and over time, how to you measure this implementation? How do you evaluate the implementation? And we think the verification of that is also essential. To our mind, the problem is the dearth of data, the absence of valid information. And I have heard from some that the Paperwork Reduction Act is part of the problem. I think it is part of the solution. And this is something that we can get into another time, but I think it is really important to focus on getting good information. Third point. What should we do to improve the situation? We propose that the government provide incentives for the private sector to do the right thing. To be sure, companies already have lots of incentives in terms of smoother, more efficient operations and in terms of marketplace acceptance. There is the Ernst & Young study which shows the correlation between success in risk management and success on Wall Street. But, again, the GAO report, and again just looking at the plans, Section which says incentives--that is where the bottom fell out. Only three sectors have fully addressed incentivizing vulnerability assessments. We gave five different carrots for you all to chew on. Carrots are good for your diet. They are part of my diet, if I get dinner tonight. In any event, many of them are actually discussed in Mr. Clinton's testimony, and I am going to defer to him on virtually all of them but I want to make two comments. I do want to distance myself from his discussion of liability limitations, limitations on liabilities for companies. I disagree with that approach. And, also, the reinsurance program at DHS. I don't think it should be a government-sponsored reinsurance program. I think he hits the nail on the head when he talks about government leading by example and the importance of the government getting its act together. One of my responsibilities while I was in Federal service at OMB was the Y K experience. Now, that is a very different order of magnitude from what we are talking about now. But if you think about the Y K adventure as a mini pilot of how the government can face these problems and work within, we had no additional command and control authorities, we had no regulatory authorities. We were nonetheless able to work collegially with the groups. We were able, with the various sectors, to share best practices, to work through the problems that had to be done on a cooperative basis, and to use trusted established relationships that already exist between members of the private sector and their State or local regulators or their Federal regulators or their colleagues. And the problem, in answer to Chairman Jackson Lee's question, what do we do? How do we solve, how do we change this relationship? We do not recommend any additional commands and control authorities. We do not think you should go the regulatory route either with respect to making DHS the SSA for the other sectors or with respect to even the sectors that it has. But DHS should not be trying to do it alone. DHS should not be dictating to others to ``do it my way.'' Rather, as we experienced in Y K, DHS should adroitly use its convening powers, take advantage for its opportunities for collaborative work together and collegially work through programs with their partners. In our written testimony, we give an even more recent example than Y K. DOE has done this very successfully on a smaller scale. That is it. Smash the stove pipes, develop metrics, and gather quality data, and have the government help in a noncommand and control regulatory way. I look forward to any questions you may have. Thank you so much. Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Ms. Katzen, for your testimony. And we enjoyed hearing what you had to say. [The statement of Ms. Katzen follows:] Prepared Statement of Sally Katzen, Esq Mr. Langevin. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Clinton for minutes. Welcome. STATEMENT OF LARRY CLINTON, PRESIDENT, INTERNET SECURITY ALLIANCE Mr. Clinton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. McCaul. The Internet Security Alliance believes the threat to our economy, our Nation, and our citizenry from cyber attacks is real and growing. We also believe that government and industry must work much more aggressively to address these threats. We are past the time for simple education. Now is the time for action. However, for industry and government to create a sustainable and effective cyber defense system, we need a fundamental rethinking about how we address these issues. First, the Internet is unlike anything we have ever dealt with before and, hence, securing it will require a solution unlike anything we have done before. In its June GAO report, they cited the number one challenge to developing a public-private sector partnership for cybersecurity was the innate characteristics of the Internet itself. The Internet is just different. It transmits phone calls but it is not a phone line. It makes copies but it is not a Xerox machine. It houses books but it is not a library. It broadcasts images but it is not a TV station. Is critical to our national defense but it is not a military installation. The Internet is international, interactive, constantly changing, constantly under attack. We cannot simply cut and paste old governing systems and realistically expect that we are going to be able to manage this new system effectively. Even if Congress were to enact an enlightened statute, it would reach only to our natural borders and hence would not be comprehensive enough. Even if some agency wrote a brilliant regulation, it would probably be out of date before it got through the entire process. Second. Information security, as Ms. Katzen has pointed out, is not a static and merely technical problem. The threats to the Net have recently morphed from the broad, benign, and well publicized attacks like Love Bug and Blaster, to Designer Now-ware that is constructed to target specific systems where it can reside undetected for a long time while causing significant economic and physical damage. As a result, traditional antivirus software and viral solutions are becoming inadequate. To adequately address the modern threats, we need an ever-evolving system that addresses all the vulnerabilities, technical and otherwise. Third, the threat to our infrastructure from cyber attack is very, very serious and growing. Two years ago, the Internet Security Alliance reported to this committee that the main protocols that the Internet is based on were over years old and had multiple well-known security flaws. Since then, the massive growth in Internet use based on these same protocols has increased our vulnerability at a massive rate. Moreover, the Internet attacks are no longer based on publicity but now are designed to generate money or, more insidiously, power and destruction. Especially worrisome are cyber attacks that would hijack systems with false information in order to discredit systems and do lasting physical damage. At a corporate level, attacks on this kind have the potential to create liabilities and losses large enough to bankrupt large companies. At a national level, attacks directed at our critical infrastructure industries could cause hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage and thousands of lives. But, fortunately, we know a good deal about how to protect ourselves. The best evidence of this is that the Internet has been under attack constantly thousands of times a day and has yet to go down. The largest study ever done of best practices found that organizations that follow the approved best practices for information security have shown a remarkable ability to fend off attacks, recover from attacks, and even deter attacks. The problem is, we need more entities to embrace these practices while also working with us to develop new ones. The best mechanism to effectively establish a sustainable defense system is to inject market incentives to motivate the adoption of best practices. Unlike some of the conversation at the first panel, markets do not emerge spontaneously. They must be created and managed. That is what we need to do with cybersecurity. In this regard, the Internet Security Alliance has come to the committee with a specific and concrete proposal. This proposal is detailed more fully in our written testimony, but it offers a market-based incentive program to bridge the gap between the purely voluntary program as outlined in the national strategy to secure cyber space, and a regulatory model which, A, won't work and, B, would probably be counterproductive. The core elements of the Cyber Safety Act would be for government to use its market power instead of its regulatory power to promote security primarily through the procurement practice. Congress can lead by example, as Ms. Katzen pointed out. Congress can tie incentives such as civil liabilities safe harbors such as those that are currently provided in the SAFETY Act. Congress can stimulate the stunted cyber insurance market, and I would be delighted to discuss the specifics with this further with the committee. And, Congress can create government industry consortiums similar to what we did with the Sema-Tech to solve our computer chip problem in the s. And, government can create awards programs. There are other market-based programs such as the use of model contracts that we can use to expand the perimeter of cybersecurity. But I urge the committee to consider acting, but acting in a novel and creative fashion. The old system won't work. A new system must be created. Thank you. [The statement of Mr. Clinton follows:] Prepared Statement of Larry Clinton Good Morning, I am Larry Clinton, President & CEO of the Internet Security Alliance (ISAlliance). I also am a member of the DHS's Communications Sector Coordinating Council, the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council and serve as an Officer on the IT Sector Coordinating Council. ISAlliance is a cross-sector trade association focused exclusively on information security. We were created in as collaboration with the Carnegie Mellon University. We now have roughly , member companies. We provide our members with a range of services, including technical, business operational and public policy. ISAlliance provides its members with an integrated series of security services addressing the technical, legal, business and public policy concerns simultaneously. I want to thank the Chairman for inviting me to participate. ISAlliance continues to believe that the threat to our economy, our nation, and our citizenry from cyber attacks is real and growing. We also believe that government and industry must work much more aggressively to address these threats. We are past the time for simple education about the cyber threat. Now is the time for action. However, for industry and government to create a sustainable and effective system of cyber defense we need a fundamental re-thinking of how we go about addressing these issues. This rethinking must include at least three critical realizations. First, the Internet is a technology unlike anything we have dealt with before and hence will require a solution unlike what we have traditionally used to address technology and business. We need to change the way government, perhaps including Congress, thinks about and conceptualizes its role in assuring Internet security. In its June report, ``Internet Infrastructure: DHS Faces Challenges in Developing a Joint Public/Private Recovery Plan,'' the GAO got it right. It listed as the number one challenge we face the ``innate characteristics of the Internet.'' How then is the Internet different? It transmits phone calls but it is not a phone line. It makes copies but it is not a Xerox machine. It houses books but it is not a library. It broadcasts images but it is not a TV station. It is critical to our national defense, but it is not a military installation. It is all these things and much, much more. The Internet is international, interactive, constantly changing, constantly under attack, then changes and changes again. It is not even really an ``It.'' It is actually lots of ``Its'' all knitted together--some public, some private--all transmitting information across corporate and national borders without stopping to pay tolls or check regional sensitivities. We can not simply ``cut and paste'' previous governance systems from old technologies or business models and realistically expect that we will be able to manage this system effectively. The regulatory model we have traditionally used to govern business has not changed much since we created it to deal with the breakthrough technology of centuries ago--the railroad. To manage the railroad, Congress decided to create an expert agency, the ICC, to pass specific regulations. The ICC begat the rest of the alphabet soup: the FCC, the SEC, the FTC. And, that system has worked arguably well in most instances. But that system will not work with Internet security. Even if Congress were to enact an enlightened statute, it would not have reach beyond our national borders and hence would not be comprehensive enough. Even if some agency wrote a brilliant regulation, it would likely be out-dated before it got through the process, a process that can be further delayed with court challenges. And that assumes, unrealistically, that the political process inherent in a government regulation system doesn't ``dumb-down'' the eventual regulations so that we wind up with a campaign-finance-style standard where everyone can attest that they met the federal regulations, but everyone knows the system is really not working. That may work in politics, but, frankly, we can't afford that when it comes to Internet security. Regrettably not enough is being done, either by government or industry, to secure cyber space. We have attempted to manage the risk of st century technology solely using regulatory models designed two centuries ago. While regulation has its place, a new, more creative, model built on market incentives must be developed. Yet, we can't stand idly by either. We must, together, develop a mechanism to assure an effective and sustainable system of security that will accommodate the global breadth of the Internet and still result in a dynamic and constantly improving system of mutual security. Second, information security is not a static technical problem. Even within the past couple of years the threats have become not just more sophisticated, but more subtle. For example, we now know that threats to the net have morphed from broad and often relatively benign, if well publicized, attacks like Love Bug and Blaster, to designer malware constructed to target specific systems where it can reside undetected by traditional methods for an indeterminate period of time while causing serious damage. As a result, traditional AV software and firewall solutions are becoming inadequate. However, a new generation of security products has been, and continues to be, developed to address the continually evolving threats. To adequately address information security concerns we need to address the full organizational system which relies on information infrastructure. Our members now look to us to provide a comprehensive risk management approach that encompasses the full-system approach necessary to address the problem. An example is our Enterprise Integration Program which addresses discrete cyber security issues ranging from preventing and handling breaches of personal information to securing the IT supply chain in the era of globalization. We address these issues by looking at their technical, business operational, human resource, legal and public policy aspects simultaneously and developing an integrated solution. We would commend this fully integrated model to our government partners to consider. Third, the threat to this nation's and the world's economic infrastructure from the risk of cyber-attack is real. Two years ago ISA reported to this Committee that the main protocol used to protect this data is over years old and has multiple well- know security flaws. Since then the massive growth in Internet use based on these same protocols has increased the vulnerability of the Internet at a massive rate. In addition there are now far more attackers and they have become increasingly more sophisticated. Whereas only a few years ago ``hackers'' created cutely named attacks like the ``love bug'' and ``slammer'' largely to get attention, the current generation use stealth and designer malware that is difficult to detect and in some cases virtually impossible to eradicate. Even worse, the motivation for Internet attacks is no longer publicity, but money, and more insidiously power and destruction. Especially worrisome are the cyber-attacks that would hijack systems with false information in order to discredit the systems or do lasting physical damage. At a corporate level, attacks of this kind have the potential to create liabilities and losses large enough to bankrupt most companies. At a national level, attacks of this kind, directed at critical infrastructure industries, have the potential to cause hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage and to cause thousands of deaths. Some of the attack scenarios that would produce the most devastating consequences are now being outlined on hacker websites and at hacker conventions. The overall patterns of cyber intrusion campaigns suggest that a number of potentially hostile groups and nation states are actively acquiring the capability to carry out such attacks. Meanwhile, the many ways in which criminal organizations could reap huge profits from highly destructive attacks are also now being widely discussed. Forth, there is some good news: We actually know a good deal about how to protect the Internet. The best evidence of this is that although the Internet is under attack constantly--thousands of times a day--it has yet to fail. The owners and operators of the Internet, primarily the major private sector players are doing a terrific job managing the defense. Major independent surveys, such as the PricewaterhouseCoopers ``Global State of Information Security''--the largest study of its kind--have indicated that those entities that follow approved best practices of information security show a remarkable ability to fend off attacks, recover from attacks and even deter attacks. The problem is that as the Internet continues to grow we need more entities to embrace these practices and technologies while also working with us to develop new ones. The critical question is: how precisely can we create such a system, if the models we have used for previous technologies are inadequate? The best mechanism to assure an adequate and sustainable defense system is to inject market incentives to motivate the adoption of best practices. That has been the mantra of the Internet Security Alliance, and The National Infrastructure Protection Plan officially embraced the need for a government supported market based incentive program stating that the ``Government can. . .[create] an environment that supports incentives for companies to voluntarily adopt widely accepted sound security practices.'' Fifth, there is a concrete proposal for moving forward. The ISAlliance has long campaigned for the development of a publicly supported market based incentive program to bridge the gap between a regulatory and pure volunteer approach. ISAlliance believes that the Federal government should advance homeland security preparedness through reliance on existing published standards and best practices, and defer to the private sector to continue to invest in and develop appropriate general and industry- specific standards for improved security. Fortunately, there exist a number of paths, most with Congressional precedent, for Congressional action to provide incentives that are in the national interest. Among these paths are: . Congress can use its market power, instead of its regulatory power by more prominently including security, along with cost into its procurement process. . Congress can lead by example by fully funding federal agency needs for cyber security and integrating security compliance into personnel evaluations along with other HR criteria . Congress can tie incentives such as civil liability safe harbors such as those provided in the Safety Act, or provide procurement credits to companies who can demonstrate compliance with market generated best practices for cyber security; . Congress can stimulate the stunted cyber insurance market by temporarily sharing the risk of a massive cyber-hurricane until the market is sufficiently large to take the risk themselves. . The Congress can create an industry/government/university consortium to stimulate the needed research, development and adoption of security protocols, similar to the Sema-Tech model used in the late s to address the computer chip gap. . The Government can create awards programs similar to the ``Baldrige Awards'' for quality which eventually became a sought after market differentiator for corporations. Earlier this year the Board of Directors of the Internet Security Alliance met and approved an outline for a legislative approach we offer for your considerations which we call the ``Cyber-Security Safety Act of .'' I spend the balance of my statement further detailing our thoughts on how the Saftey Act can be used as a model for improved cyber security. We do not come to the Committee with legislative language which we are endorsing, but rather with a set of concrete policy proposals we urge the Congress to work with us on perfecting. We believe the ``Cyber Safety Act'' offers a coherent approach which will create specific Federal support for a package of incentives that will affirmatively encourage private sector investment in improved security and protection of the Internet. I would like to use the remainder of my testimony to outline he specific incentive recommendations and offer a brief analysis in their support: Establish a mechanism which will enable companies that adopt standards-based information security programs or best practices to be qualified to receive the specified incentives (``Qualified Companies''). The availability of incentives requires some type of baseline as a criterion to be met for the incentives to be available. The ISAlliance has long advocated that private sector standards and best practices are already in place that can be adopted by DHS as a basis for incentives. Create, in connection with privacy reform legislation (such as uniform breach notice laws), a Federal limitation of liability for Qualifying Companies that would limit their liability for breaches that occur, notwithstanding their use of standards-based security and best practices. Information security is closely associated with privacy protection. Many companies otherwise eligible to be Qualified Companies have large volumes of personal information requiring protection under various Federal and state laws. Those companies will not be motivated to move forward with their cyber-security investments if they still are exposed to liability when breaches occur notwithstanding good security practices. As a final piece of the litigation-related incentives, this incentive eliminates the inhibitor of continued privacy-related liability for Qualifying Companies. Establish Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs) and other legal frameworks through which private sector companies do business with the United States government that: Require the agencies to specify published standards and best practices as required elements for any contract relating to information security, data protection or similar services. Qualified Companies should be able to acquire additional cyber-security insurance to cover losses arising from CINS-related catastrophic events, and limit their liability to third-parties to the amount of that insurance. The amount of the insurance acquired must be reasonable in order to qualify for the limited liability. Many companies defer investments in improved security out of a concern that, even with improved security, they are not protected from liability for losses that occur despite the quality of their security controls. Businesses are encouraged to invest in becoming Qualified Companies when they are offered the protection that is provided by (a) assuring the availability of insurance to cover losses from CINS- related catastrophic events and (b) limited their liability to the amount of insurance that has been obtained. The principles of limiting liability to encourage improved homeland security are similar to the structures used to incent new homeland security technologies under the SAFETY Act which was enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of . To support the preceding insurance market, the Federal government should create within DHS a national program for temporary, short term reinsurance, through which insurers may purchase reinsurance coverage for their exposure to CINS- related catastrophic losses under policies issued to Qualified Companies. Insurance carriers have been reluctant to create a vigorous marketplace for cybersecurity insurance. The chief reason is that the insurance companies lack sufficient experience with cyber-terrorism to effectively evaluate the overall risks in order to determine effective premium levels, particularly for CINS-related catastrophes. The proposed establishment of a reinsurance program provides underwriting for the insurance companies. In the event losses are incurred by the purchasing insurance carrier is greater than their reinsurance deductible, the insurer would be entitled to coverage under the reinsurance agreement with the Federal program. The program administrator would have the right to increase future reinsurance premiums as deemed necessary to accomplish a revenue neutral goal. Over time, the program could be sunsetted as the insurance market gains experience with cyber-security coverage. This solution is similar to Federal legislation that enhances the airline transport industry. Qualified Companies with appropriate insurance will also have litigation-related incentives available, excluding liability for consequential and punitive damages and limiting their liability for non-economic losses. Similar to the incentive provided by a limitation on losses to the available insurance, the limitation of liability for consequential and punitive damages, and limited liability for non-economic losses removes a serious inhibitor to information security investments-- i.e., the risk of losses for which responsibility is assigned notwithstanding a company's good faith investments in adequate information security. Eliminating that inhibitor encourages a more secure preparedness, company-by-company. On many occasions, the Federal government has employed its influence as a major purchaser from the private sector to encourage companies to develop and implement improved business practices. Establishing criteria tied to providing services to the government offers new market opportunities to Qualified Companies and, in doing so, provides strong economic incentives to improving their cyber-security. Establish a ``Baldrige Award'' for information security quality and excellence, coordinated with specific industry organizations to develop and create awareness of information security as a competitive differentiator. The Malcolm Baldrige Award by the US Department of Commerce has become a cherished recognition of excellence in the marketplace. A similar program, perhaps recognizing information security excellence within industry sectors, will greatly increase awareness of the value of information security and its function as a competitive differentiator, thereby encouraging new investments. Create and fund an industry/government/university consortium to stimulate the needed research, development and adoption of security protocols that can, in turn, stimulate improved technologies for adoption across the private sector and government computer systems. In the late 's, the Federal government provided matching funding to create an industry-government cooperative consortium that collaborated in accelerating solutions to common manufacturing problems in semi-conductor production (SEMATECH). This successful model revitalized the U.S. semiconductor industry and continues to generate industry leadership and innovation long after Federal funding was voluntarily terminated by the consortium. A similar program today will enable government, academia and industry to work together to replace today's security poor Internet protocols with security-rich protocols. Those protocols can enhance the quality and integrity of the hardware devices, switches and other components from which the Internet is constructed. Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Clinton. Mr. Langevin. And the Chair now recognizes Dr. Gordon to summarize your statement for minutes. Welcome, Dr. Gordon. STATEMENT OF LARRY GORDON, ERNST & YOUNG, ALUMNI PROFESSOR, MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING INFORMATION ASSURANCE, ROBERT H. SMITH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, Mr. Gordon. Chairman Langevin, Chairwoman Jackson Lee. Thank you very much for inviting me here. My comments are going to focus on how to improve cybersecurity investments within the private sector. I am going to concentrate on four points which are all detailed in my testimony that I wrote up and submitted already. But before I talk about these four points, let me just mention two things. One is that in the private sector, efficient allocation of resources is fundamental, and the reason that is fundamental is because that leads to profits, and profits leads to increasing the value of the firm. And increasing the value of the firm is a key concern to all senior executives in the private sector. The second point I want to make is that investments in cyber computer compete with other investments. And I think that is also fundamental to keep in mind. With that said, let me go to my four points. The first point I want to make is that the best, the strongest incentive by far is to have the private sector recognize that it is in their best interests in terms of increasing the value of the firm to increase investments in cybersecurity. There is a well-established process among business people for looking at efficient allocation of resources. That often is a concept that falls under the umbrella of what we sometimes call making the business case. Making the business case is the notion of using a well-established metric cost benefit analysis. There are various models of cost benefit analysis. And actually looking at alternative investments, rank ordering them, and then allocating their resources. So my first point is that in order to get business people to invest more in cybersecurity, what you want them to do is to recognize the importance of efficient allocation of resources toward cybersecurity investments. In other words, it is an internal incentive. It is a business incentive. Now, one of the problems in this regard is that the people who are often arguing for cybersecurity investments, the CIOs, the chief security officers, their training is primarily in technology what you might call computer security. And many of them, at least traditionally, have not been well versed in the notion of how to make the business case. So let me give you a little real world story. About years ago, I was approached by the chief security officer for a Fortune company, and he came up to me and said--he met with me for lunch, and he was all upset because he met with his CFO for his company and he asked for a $ million upgrade to the network, the security of the network for that company. And the CFO said to him: Where is your business case? So when he came to me and we discussed it at lunch, he said: What's wrong with the CFO? Doesn't he understand the importance of security? And my immediate reaction was: If I were the CFO, when you left the room I would probably be saying, what's wrong with you? Don't you understand the importance of economics? If I give you $ million to upgrade the security. I am essentially taking away from something else. And the name of the game for the private sector is, generating profits so that what you can do is you can increase the value of the firm. And when you talk about cybersecurity investments, it is what we call in capital budgeting a cost savings project. And what you really want to do when you are in a private sector is not only save costs, but equally if not more important is increase revenues. In other words, there is two ways to increase profits. You can increase revenues, save costs. And when you talk about cybersecurity investments, one of the big problems, this is my second point, is estimating the benefits which are really cost benefits here, what you are really talking about is estimating the cost savings. And the cost savings are particularly tough to estimate for two reasons. One is a big chunk of the cost savings really come from, if you have a cybersecurity breach what you have here is you lose customers and so a big chunk of those cost savings come from avoiding lost customers. And a second big chunk of those cost savings come from the notion of potential liabilities. And these are two very tough things to measure. And in order to measure them properly, you have got to take into consideration risks, the risks associated with the breach. And there are different notions of risk. There is a well- established body of literature in economics and finance and in insurance which has all kinds of metrics for measuring risk. These metrics have not been well integrated into the cybersecurity literature. You don't have to go out and discover new metrics. They are there already. So that is my second point. My third point is that when you talk about cybersecurity, you have got another unique kind of issue and that is you have got what we call spillover effects, or in economics we call it externalities. And these externalities really relate to the fact that a big chunk of the costs associated with cybersecurity are private costs, costs associated to a private company. But also, another large share of these costs we call social costs. And these social costs, this is where government incentives become important. These social costs are costs that are borne by other companies, not the company that is not practicing cybersecurity. And my last point that I want to make relates to Sarbanes- Oxley Act, or affectionately known as SOX. One of the things that recent research has shown is that SOX actually has as a side effect increased the cybersecurity activities of firms. It was, seems to me, unintended. Part of SOX requires that corporations improve their internal controls systems. There is no way an internal control system can be improved if you don't have strong security. And what has happened since SOX has gone into effect, research has shown that corporations are increasing their security activities. I would suggest that in respect to all four of these points, that this committee and the Department of Homeland Security can do several things to improve cybersecurity investments. First, my first recommendation would be to set up some kind of workshops associated with making the business case for cybersecurity investments. That is the first thing. The second thing is that we need more research in looking at how do you actually determine the benefits associated with cybersecurity investments. Third, we need to look at the kinds of incentive plans that governments set up related to these externalities, these social costs. Now, lots of people talk about tax credits, and that is certainly one option. Another option, one that I probably think should be looked at more carefully, is maybe the government needs to set up tough security standards. Now, you can do this by regulation, but I would recommend something different. I might recommend setting up tough security standards, and alongside of those is basically give preferential treatment on government contracts to those companies that comply with those standards. So you are giving them an economic incentive to comply with those standards. And the last point I want to make is I think this committee and DHS should take a close look at the relation between cybersecurity activities at firms and Sarbanes-Oxley Act. I think what you will find is that a lot of good things are coming out of that that actually relate to your concern with improving cybersecurity in the private sector. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, and I will be glad to answer any questions you have related to my comments. Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Dr. Gordon, and I thank the panel for their testimony. [The statement of Mr. Gordon follows:] Incentives for Improving Cybersecurity in the Private Sector: A Cost- Benefit Perspective Prepared Statement of Dr. Lawrence A. Gordon (http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/lgordon/) Thank you for inviting me here today to talk about economic aspects of improving cybersecurity in the private sector. I commend the members of the Subcommittee for focusing on this critical and complicated issue. Introduction My comments today will center on ways of encouraging (i.e., providing incentives for) investments that are directed at improving cybersecurity in profit-oriented organizations operating in the private sector. However, much of what I have to say would also apply, with some modifications, to non-profit organizations (in both the private and public sector). My comments are based on an ongoing stream of research on ``economic aspects of cyber/information security'' that I (along with several colleagues) started in . Part of this research has already been published, as indicated in the reference section at the end of this testimony.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Given the limited nature of this testimony, many facets of the above noted stream of research are not directly addressed in this document (e.g., cybersecurity risk management). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A key concern among profit-oriented organizations is efficiency. This concern is usually thought of in terms of facilitating the generation of profits (i.e., the difference between revenues and costs) for the owners of an organization, with the ultimate goal being to increase the value of the organization. Indeed, the most powerful incentive for an organization in the private sector to invest in cybersecurity activities is the motivation to increase the organization's value to its owners. For a publicly traded profit- oriented corporation, this value proposition is usually (or at least primarily) thought of in terms of increasing the stockholders' value. At the heart of implementing this stockholders' value proposition is the notion of cost-benefit analysis. ``Cost-benefit analysis compares the costs of an activity to the benefits of that activity, thereby focusing attention on the process of efficiently allocating scarce resources among competing activities. In the context of cybersecurity, the cost-benefit analysis principle means that managers need to compare the costs of an additional information security activity with the benefits derived from that activity'' (Gordon and Loeb, , p. - ). When the benefits exceed the costs, the value of the organization will increase. Thus, in considering a decision to increase spending on cybersecurity activities, it is important that the organization believe that the benefits will exceed the costs. A fundamental assumption underlying the above concept of cost- benefit analysis is the fact that organizations have scarce resources that need to be allocated to competing activities, including cybersecurity activities. In other words, cybersecurity activities are competing with other organizational activities (e.g., new product development, R&D, merger and acquisition decisions, fringe benefits for employees, etc.). If an organization invests more in cybersecurity activities, that means less will be available for other initiatives (i.e., organizations have finite resources to invest in competing projects). Accordingly, it is important for profit-oriented organizations to be able to argue that cybersecurity investments represent a more efficient allocation of organizational resources (on a cost-benefit basis) than if such resources were put to an alternative use (e.g., developing a new product). In the vernacular of business, this means it is important to be able to ``make the business case'' for investing in the cybersecurity activities. Generally speaking, there is a well established process for making the business case for an investment, including investments in cybersecurity activities. Figure provides a diagram of that process. As indicated in Figure , making the business case starts with specifying the cybersecurity objectives for the organization. Next, various alternative investments for achieving the cybersecurity objectives need to be identified. Once the alternatives have been identified, the data associated with each alternative needs to be specified and analyzed. The next step is to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and to rank the various investment alternatives, followed by the allocation of resources to particular cybersecurity investment(s).\ \ The final step in the business case framework is to conduct a post-audit of the investment decision (i.e., evaluate the effectiveness of the cybersecurity investment decision). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ For a detailed explanation on the mathematics underlying cost- benefit analysis, based on discounted cash flows, see Chapter of Gordon and Loeb ( ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately, making the business case for cybersecurity investments is often more difficult than making the business case for many other investments. There are at least three separate, albeit related, aspects to this added difficulty. First, the benefits derived from cybersecurity investments are especially difficult to assess. Second, the risks associated with cybersecurity investments are also especially difficult to assess. Third, there are externalities (spill- over effects) associated with cybersecurity investments. A brief discussion of each of these concerns is provided below. In addition to the benefits, risks and externalities associated with cybersecurity investments, there are two other items that are important to any discussion of improving cybersecurity investments in the private sector. These two additional items concern the total amount to spend on cybersecurity activities and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of . A brief discussion of both of these items is also provided below. Benefits Derived from Cybersecurity Investments The first difficulty associated with cybersecurity investments has to do with identifying and estimating the benefits derived from such investments. The primary benefits associated with cybersecurity investments are the future ``cost savings'' derived from the prevention of losses due to cybersecurity breaches.\ \ However, if breaches were prevented, the actual losses would not occur and therefore would not be observable. In fact, the better the security, the less an organization will observe the losses resulting from cybersecurity breaches. Thus, organizations need to estimate the potential losses from cybersecurity breaches in order to estimate the benefits derived from cybersecurity investments. These estimates can be based on past experiences, where such experience exists. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ It can also be argued that cybersecurity investments can create a competitive advantage for an organization, which in turn translates into potential benefits. Although this argument is correct, such benefits are generally considered to be secondary in relation to the potential cost savings from such investments. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A fundamental problem in coming up with estimates of the benefits derived from cybersecurity investments is that the most important potential losses are due to unobservable lost customers resulting from cyber breaches and the potential liabilities associated with cyber breaches. In fact, as shown in the Campbell et al. ( ) study, these costs can be staggering.\ \ Unfortunately, even when organizations have data upon which to estimate the explicit losses associated with detecting and correcting past breaches, they rarely have data upon which to estimate the implicit losses associated with lost customers and the potential liabilities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ The Campbell et al. ( ) study also shows that many cybersecurity breaches are not statistically significant, in an economic sense. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- One way of addressing part of the problem discussed above concerning estimates of the benefits of cybersecurity investments is to take a ``wait-and-see'' approach to such investments. As pointed out in the Gordon, Loeb and Lucyshyn ( a) study, this wait-and-see approach is consistent with the ``real options'' (more specifically, the ``deferment option'') approach to capital budgeting. Of course, as the name suggests, it also means that it is often best to defer certain investments in cybersecurity due to the problems associated with estimating the potential benefits. The fact that the benefits derived from cybersecurity investments are essentially ``cost savings'' raises an additional issue not discussed above. That additional issue has to do with the fact that most corporate executives would prefer to increase profits by increasing revenues rather than by decreasing costs. The reason for this preference is due to the fact that the stock market tends to reward the owners of firms for growth as well as efficiency. Thus, in competing for funds, cybersecurity investments have a built in bias against them relative to ``revenue generating'' projects. Risks Associated with Cybersecurity Investments The second difficulty associated with cybersecurity investments deals with the risks (or uncertainty) associated with such investments.\ \ It is important to recognize at the onset that % security is rarely feasible in a technical sense, and certainly not cost-beneficial in an economic sense. Thus, it is important to realize that cybersecurity investments are intended to reduce the risk (i.e., probability) of cybersecurity breaches. However, determining the reduction in the probability of a particular breach taking place, let alone a string of breaches taking place, as result of a cyber investment is extremely difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, in estimating the benefits from cybersecurity investments it becomes necessary to associate those benefits with the probability of the occurrence of security breaches. In other words, the ``expected'' cost savings (i.e., expected benefits) from cybersecurity investments are actually derived by multiplying the potential cyber losses by the difference between the probability of the cyber security losses occurring prior to the cybersecurity investment and the probability of the cybersecurity losses occurring after the investment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ In the early economics literature, a distinction is sometimes made between the terms risk and uncertainty (see Gordon and Loeb, , p. ). For purposes of this testimony, no such distinction is made. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Not surprisingly, estimating the before and after probabilities associated with cyber losses is more an art than a science. Thus, many have argued that the entire process of trying to estimate the expected benefits derived from cybersecurity investments is nothing more than an academic exercise. However, the fact that it is difficult to estimate the risk (uncertainty) associated with cybersecurity breaches should not be used as an excuse for avoiding the determination of such estimates. Another aspect of the risk associated with cybersecurity investments deals with the definition of the term risk. In the cybersecurity literature, risk is usually associated with the expected loss from security breaches (i.e., the sum of the product of potential losses multiplied by the probability of such losses). The goal of reducing the risk of a cybersecurity breach, according to this definition of risk, is to reduce the expected loss. However, there are other important notions of risk that should be of interest to those responsible for allocating cybersecurity investments. For example, reducing the variance (i.e., variation) of the potential losses is another valuable facet of risk when discussing cybersecurity investments.\ \ Although beyond the scope of the testimony being submitted today, it should be noted that one way for an organization to reduce the risk associated with cybersecurity breaches is to invest in cybersecurity insurance (see Gordon, Loeb and Sohail, ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ The expected loss and reducing the variance of potential losses are only two of the different concepts of risk that could be considered in the context of cybersecurity investments. For a further discussion of various risk concepts applicable to cybersecurity investments, see Chapter of Gordon and Loeb ( ). Externalities Associated with Cybersecurity Investments The third difficulty associated with cybersecurity investments relates to the externalities (i.e., spillover effects) associated with such investments. These spillover effects are largely the result of the inherent interconnectivity associated with computer networks. In other words, the security of a computer network--particularly the Internet-- depends on the actions of all users of the network. This creates a problem in the following sense. When a firm invests in information security activities in an effort to improve its cybersecurity, it bears all the costs, but does not reap all the benefits. The larger the share of the benefits that accrue to other firms, the smaller the incentive for a firm to increase its investments in cybersecurity activities. This may result in the firm, and hence society, under-investing in information security. While the government could, in principle, counteract this tendency by creating incentives for information security investments (for example, by offering tax credits for such investments), the government currently does not know the right level of incentives to provide. The externalities associated with the Internet have resulted in all sorts of efforts to coordinate cybersecurity activities on both a national and international level. The ISACs (Information Sharing Analysis Centers) and the US-CERT (United States Computer Emergency Response Team) are two good examples of efforts to coordinate cybersecurity activities. Both of these efforts rely heavily on information sharing related to computer security, with particular emphasis placed upon protecting the nation's critical infrastructure. Information sharing has the potential for lowering the cost of cybersecurity for each organization involved in such a program. Unfortunately, the free-rider problem (i.e., the situation where each member of a group shares a little amount of information, in the hope of learning a lot about the other members of the group), is prevalent among information sharing arrangements related to cybersecurity (see Gordon, Loeb and Lucyshyn, b). Thus, unless economic incentives are devised to offset the free-rider problem, much of the potential benefit from information sharing organizations will not be realized. How much in Total should be Invested in Cybersecurity Activities? The cost-benefit framework discussed above provides a straightforward way of assessing the benefits and costs associated with incremental investments in cybersecurity activities. If we assume that an organization already has in place some initial level of cybersecurity spending, then the total spending on cybersecurity activities would be this initial spending plus the sum of incremental investments. A more sophisticated approach to deriving the right amount to invest in cybersecurity activities is to assume a zero-base starting position for such investments. In its most rigorous form, a mathematical model can be developed to derive the optimal amount an organization should spend on cybersecurity activities. Although cost- benefit analysis would be embedded within such a model, an optimization approach would be a far more sophisticated (in terms of the mathematics) approach to deriving the right amount to invest in cybersecurity. This model should involve specifying security breach functions, the potential losses associated with security breaches, the probability of such losses, and the productivity of cybersecurity investments. One model for deriving the optimal amount to invest in cybersecurity activities, which has gained wide acceptance among academicians and many practitioners, is referred to as the Gordon-Loeb Model. This model is described in the paper by Gordon and Loeb ( ). It must be emphasized, however, that the Gordon-Loeb Model is best viewed as a ``framework'' for examining the optimal level of spending on cybersecurity, rather than as an absolute solution to the cybersecurity investment dilemma. Indeed, in the final analysis, determining the right amount to spend on cybersecurity activities requires sound business judgment (based on experience and knowledge related to a particular firm and industry), as well as the application of sound economic principles. In other words, in the final analysis, there is no silver bullet for deriving the right amount to spend on cybersecurity. Since cybersecurity investment decisions are made based on expectations of the future, the likelihood of getting the optimal solution to the investment problem is close to zero. However, it is important to realize that on average an organization would be better off by utilizing sound economic principles in making cybersecurity investment decisions than ignoring such principles. Sarbanes-Oxley Act has Created an Incentive to Increase Cybersecurity Activities The accounting scandals of the late s resulted in the Sarbanes- Oxley Act (SOX) of . A key aspect of this legislation deals with the internal control requirements of SOX under Section . In essence, SOX requires firms registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to develop sound internal control procedures associated with financial reporting. Given the computer-based nature of modern organizations, it is generally agreed that sound internal controls implies sound information security. Thus, as shown by Gordon, Loeb, Lucyshyn and Sohail ( ), an indirect result of SOX has been to create an incentive for firms to increase their information security activities (and by implication, investments) by firms. In essence, research suggests that SOX has created a strong incentive for organizations to increase their cybersecurity investments. Although the above claim has not been directly tested, the findings by Gordon, Loeb, Luchyshyn and Sohail ( ) clearly point to the validity of this claim. Summary and Recommendations The above discussion highlights several key aspects of investments directed at improving cybersecurity within profit-oriented organizations operating within the private sector. These aspects can be summarized in terms of the following five points. . The most powerful incentive for an organization in the private sector to invest in cybersecurity activities is the motivation to increase the organization's value to its owners. At the heart of implementing this value proposition is the concept of cost-benefit analysis, which falls under the umbrella of ``making the business case'' for cybersecurity investments. The idea of deriving an optimal level of investment in cybersecurity activities is closely associated with this cost-benefit concept. Unfortunately, many (if not most) CIOs (Chief Information Officers) and CSOs (Chief Security Officers) are not well versed in the economic underpinnings of cost-benefit analysis. Accordingly, it is often difficult for those responsible for cybersecurity activities within a firm to make a cogent argument for increasing the firm's spending on such activities. Remember, an increase in spending on cybersecurity activities generally means that less is available for spending on other initiatives (including revenue generating initiatives) within the organization. Thus, my recommendation is for this Subcommittee to initiate an effort to establish training sessions for CIOs and CSOs on how to apply cost-benefit analysis to cybersecurity investment decisions. The development of these sessions could fall under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security. In my opinion, such training would go a long way toward improving the allocation of private sector resources toward cybersecurity activities. . A fundamental problem in coming up with estimates of the benefits from cybersecurity investments is that the most important potential losses are due to unobservable lost customers resulting from cyber breaches and potential liabilities associated with cyber breaches. Until organizations feel more comfortable with their estimates of the benefits from cybersecurity investments, it is unlikely they will make the necessary commitment to such investments. In other words, the tendency will be to treat cybersecurity investments as a necessary evil rather than sound economic investments. Thus, my recommendation is for this Subcommittee to encourage, under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security, additional research related to estimating the benefits of cybersecurity investments. . The fact that it is difficult to estimate the risks associated with cybersecurity breaches should not be used as an excuse for avoiding the determination of such estimates. The risks associated with cybersecurity are difficult to estimate. As a result, many view the process of deriving the ``expected benefits'' from cybersecurity investments as merely an academic exercise. However, there is an extensive body of existing literature on risk that has direct bearing upon cybersecurity investments. To date, this literature on risk has not been well integrated into the cybersecurity literature. Thus, my recommendation is that the cost-benefit analysis training sessions suggested in the first point above should include coverage of this literature on risk. . The inherent interconnectivity associated with computer networks creates externalities (spillover effects). These externalities revolve around issues related to welfare economics (i.e., a branch of economics associated with improving the welfare of an entire society or economic system, usually based on such principles as the efficiency of resource allocations and equitable income distribution to individuals). Since it is difficult to get organizations to incorporate these externalities into their decisions regarding cybersecurity investments, the development of exogenous government incentives may be appropriate. Thus, my recommendation is for this Subcommittee to encourage research directed at examining the appropriateness of developing incentives to address these externalities. . Research suggests that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of has created a strong incentive for organizations to increase their cybersecurity activities. The fact that there is preliminary evidence that SOX has created a strong incentive for organizations to increase their cybersecurity activities, and by implication their spending on such activities, is worth exploring in greater depth. Indeed, assuming these preliminary findings are correct, there may be ways for the Department of Homeland Security to capitalize on this development. Thus, my recommendation is for this Subcommittee to facilitate further exploration of this SOX-cybersecurity relation. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . . eps[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T . . epsMr. Langevin. I now recognize myself for minutes. And let me begin with you briefly, Dr. Gordon, on your point that one of the primary goals of a firm is to increase the asset value of the firm. But what about protecting the asset value of the firm? And why is it that that isn't more readily apparent as a need, in a sense a primary goal of doing business, right along with increasing value at the firm? Mr. Gordon. I think both of those actually address the issue of increasing value, but I would put it in a slightly different context. I would say that in the capital budgeting literature, we talk about generic areas of capital investments. One is revenue generating products, new product development, mergers and acquisitions. Another one would be what we call cost savings projects. Cybersecurity investments fall under that category. The third category is what we often call must-do projects. So the way I would answer your question is to say that when you get to these cost savings projects, it is much tougher. And when you get to cybersecurity investments they are the toughest. And the reason they are the toughest, it is much tougher to actually observe the benefits. And the reason for that is if you do the job right, then you have avoided those breaches, you have avoided those catastrophes, and you don't really see what you would have incurred as a cost. So that is why they are particularly tough. And that is why, when you talk about protecting assets in that sense, it is a different kind of project. It is not that they don't add value to the firm. They do. It is just often harder for managers to figure out how to quantify it. I am a big believer in that you should try to--you know, what you measure is what you get. You need metrics. And after you come up with these, I look at these metrics as a framework. Once you get those, then of course you have got to bring in good business judgment, nonfinancial concerns, nonquantitative concerns. But there is a well established process for doing that. So what you have to do is go through and estimate these benefits. Mr. Langevin. You have each had the opportunity to hear each other's testimony. Let me just go down the line and ask, was there anything that you heard in the other testimony of your fellow panel members right now that struck you that you highly agree with or strongly disagree with? Ms. Katzen. On the basis of both the oral statements and the written testimony which I had read, I think we are in violent agreement. We all seem to believe and advocate that necessity for getting good metrics, good data, good research; that the government should not be regulating; that one size does not fit all; that it is not an IT problem, that it is an enterprise-wide problem. That there are business cases involved, and that there should be market-based incentives, with the government holding out some additional incentives to bring the companies to the table. And I don't hear very much difference among us. Mr. Clinton. I would have to agree with Ms. Katzen. I am struck very pleasantly by the degree of agreement with regard to what is the best way forward for Congress. And it is for Congress to act, but for Congress to act in a novel fashion. Professor Gordon's testimony, which I think is probably pretty difficult to summarize orally, although I think he did a wonderful job with it, goes into really good detail on why it is very, very difficult for real corporations to justify the sort of extraordinary expenses that we would like to have them make for security that goes beyond their corporate borders. That is just not going to happen. For about years, we have been hearing rhetoric from DHS and others saying, well, gee, if industry would only get it and realize the value proposition is there for them to protect their own resources, then that would take care of it. That has not happened. The amount of spending has not increased dramatically. It is not going to increase dramatically unless we develop a market for this. Now, that is an unhappy solution, but I don't see how we can come to any other realistic solution. There are a range of things. One of the things we haven't talked about here is that virtually all of the ideas, and again most of us have articulated pretty much the same ideas, use procurement better, use awards programs. You know, based on standards. You know, most of the standards are already there in the private sector. We already know a lot about how to do this. We are under attack thousands of times a day. We are preventing lots of them. We just need more people to adopt these things. So we don't need the government to come in and provide standards. We don't need the government to come in and regulate these things. We need the government to come in and provide incentives. And the sort of incentives that I have articulated in my testimony are incentives that have already been used in agriculture, in aviation, in the environmental sphere, in ground transportation, in tax law. The government has done this stuff before, they have just not applied it to cybersecurity. And that is what I would argue, is that if we would take the precedent that we have found in other sectors of the economy and the standards that have already been proven effective in mitigating the attacks that we are having every day, that is the payoff forward for improved cybersecurity, which is in the national interest. Mr. Gordon. In general, I would agree with what my colleagues have to say here, although--and I hate to put an end to the love fest, but I see a different focus. And let me tell you the focus. First of all, market-based incentives, they already exist. The clearest market-based incentive is to get firms to realize it is in their best interest in terms of cost efficiency to invest more in cybersecurity investments. And the other point I would make is, so it is not that we disagree, but I am saying the focus to me is it is already out there. We have got to get firms to understand how to use that better, and I think that is something your committee could certainly facilitate. The other point I want to mention is that I thought the point mentioned about Enterprise Risk Management, ERM, was really a good one. And so I appreciate the fact that it was mentioned. However, having done a lot of work in that area, let me tell you the problem with ERM. ERM comes from COSO, the Committee on Sponsoring Organization from the accounting organizations. And COSO talks about ERM in four categories. They talk about operations, they talk about financial reporting, they talk about compliance and strategy. What they don't do is give you a metric for measuring it. And if you go and read this ERM literature, what you will find is and you need, in my opinion, is if you need a metric for measuring it. In fact, I have got a Ph.D. student who just finished up a dissertation working on this very topic. And when he came to me and wanted to do something on ERM, the first thing I said to him is, you realize you are going to have to come up with a metric. What we need is some kind of a metric for measuring have we improved it. So it is not that I would disagree. I would just say the focus has to be on developing a metric for ERM. And so I don't think we disagree. It is just a question of focus. I tend to be more focused on the quantitative metrics. Mr. Langevin. My question for Mr. Clinton is, isn't it the case, though, that firms in the private sector when, in a sense creating standards, that they tend to create substandard standards? Mr. Clinton. No. I am not aware of any evidence of that. In my testimony, I cite the largest study that has been done on information security which, independent study, PriceWaterhouseCoopers study. And they found that the companies, the best practices group, the group they classified as following these things, were able to mitigate against attacks better, didn't lose money like others did, and, in fact, could deter tax. It is, as Professor Gordon has just alluded, companies do want to protect their own cyber systems. But the Internet transcends those cyber systems. If you read the discussion of externalities that is in Professor Gordon's testimony, I think he makes a really good argument here. Basically, what we need is for corporations that go to their own corporate borders for their own self-interests, to provide security that goes to the entire system. And that is--it is important to remember, there is no private sector. There is no thing that is the private sector. The private sector is thousands and thousands of different companies, with different goals, technologies, et cetera. We have to get all these guys to cooperate. They do cooperate. They set standards all the time to make sure their systems are interoperable, so that they can generate more investment, have cooperative engagements, et cetera, et cetera. There is plenty of reason for them to set good standards. And the research indicates that when they follow those standards and best practices, we do have demonstrable improvements in cybersecurity. I am not going to say it is percent, because the threat, as I also pointed out, continually evolves. So we need to continue to work on it. But the evidence that I am aware of, with all respect, Mr. Chairman, is the opposite. Is that rather industry set standards adequate to meet their needs, and then attempts to meet those standards. Moreover, one last point. One of the projects that we are involved in at the Internet Security Alliance is to develop model contracts around those standards, so that the really good players like Verizon who testified on the first panel--and they are doing a great job. They are just doing as good a job as you can do, I think, from what I can see. What they want to do and what we are working with them to do is to take their system and write contracts for their vendors, their suppliers, their customers, that include in those contracts compliance with the high-level security systems that Verizon is already having, so that we are using contracts to expand the perimeter of security rather than using regulation. And those contracts are much easier to update, keep up with the technology, keep up with the evolving threat, than going through a regulatory model which takes years. And, frankly, I think it is the regulatory model. You get a bunch of lobbyists coming in, they will dumb it down for you. Mr. Langevin. My concern is that the private sector would tend to skimp or to underestimate risk. We heard testimony last week on the electric grid, where the industry ostensibly self regulates through NERC that makes recommendations to FERC about the type of regulations that should be put in place. Yet, clearly the self regulation process in that instance doesn't quite go far enough. And I believe that a model similar to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is stronger where they have the ability to come in and direct, as opposed to just allowing industry to kind of self-advise, self-regulate. Mr. Clinton. If I could respond quickly to the chairman. And I apologize for taking too much time. I wouldn't classify myself as an expert in that particular sector. I frankly don't have any members in that particular sector. We are a cross- sector organization. My sense would be that that is the sort of thing that we could work with. I can tell you that there are standards that have been shown to work. I am unfamiliar with the standards that they have. It would seem to me that the government, particularly in a regulated sector such as the one you are describing, certainly can use that. But let me point out something that was not pointed out in the first panel, which is when GAO did their study, they found that the number one sector that had done the best job was completely unregulated, the IT sector. The banking sector, which is heavily regulated, did among the worst jobs. So I don't think that there is a one-to-one correspondence here with respect to regulated/unregulated in terms of doing a good job in this area. I think what we need to do is find a set of standards that we would agree on meet certain metrics. No disagreement on that. And then find ways to get more companies to do that. But you have got to do it in a way so that you can keep up with the threat. Ms. Katzen. If I could. What I hear, though, is almost so obvious, that this is not easy on the ERM. There are lots of ERM models, and they have to be adapted in different ways. Cost benefit analysis, I have spent the last years of my professional life of doing cost benefit analysis. It is not easy. There are ways of doing it and there is literature out there and it has to work. The problem is the diversity of the corporate models, the diversity of corporate awareness, the differences in technical capabilities. You are not dealing with the monolithic world. Someone said there is no private sector, there is lots of components of a private sector. And this decentralized nature can be very offputting or frustrating. But if you can't fix it, flaunt it. Use it. And that means don't look for a silver bullet. Don't look for a one-size-fits- all. Don't look for the perfect thing that would work in one sector to be applied in another, but apply sort of what comes naturally to each sector. Thank you. Mr. Langevin. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member. Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate everybody's patience. It is getting late, and we have got an anniversary, we have trick-or-treaters tonight. We convened at : . It has been hours. I would like to get more input in writing, if that would be acceptable. It is just getting a little late and I have got to run on to another obligation. But what I am hearing is, and tell me if I am wrong. It sounds like, nobody here is advocating regulatory reform, but, rather, market-based incentives. Is that correct? Is that a fair statement, from all three? Mr. Gordon. I think there is something in between. And the something in between is you can have government incentives, which is not necessarily regulatory in nature. For example, you could go to NIST and ask NIST to set up the standards for you for security, and you can reward companies. Companies that are following those standards, you might give them preferential treatment with government contracts. I don't view that as regulation, but that is not straightforward market reform. Mr. McCaul. Sort of the novel, Mr. Clinton, where you are talking about the novel creative approach would be to look at this through the government contracting process, to provide incentives through that process? Mr. Clinton. That is one way absolutely. Yes. Mr. McCaul. What are some other market-based initiatives or incentives that can be used without regulation? Ms. Katzen. One of the ones that we talk about, and I think Mr. Clinton does as well, is a recognition and reward program modeled on the Energy Star, which we use to increase energy efficiency; and, have a Cyber Star program where there would be recognition if you set the bar high enough and you require them to keep increasing their security. Another of the workshops that I think we are all talking about, whether it is to educate for how to use or do a risk assessment or whether you are talking about how to use ERM, we are all talking about providing additional information. Not trying to hoard it, but to share it. And I think those kinds of incentives, whether the government picks up the cost of Federally-sponsored programs or gives tax credits for it are things that each of us have talked about in different ways, but somehow uses the Federal support for information sharing. Those are just two ideas that I think all three of us have signed onto one way or the other. Mr. Clinton. Briefly, Mr. McCaul. In addition to what has been said, there are a number of things that can be done with insurance. Insurance is one of the strongest motivators that we use in health care, you know, good driving, et cetera, cetera, and there are a whole range of things that could be done with respect to insurance. As we have mentioned procurement, there are awards programs like the Baldrige Award. Make security a market differentiator, publicize that. There are creative consortiums like the Sema-Tech program that we did back in the s. There are the contract systems that we use. As I said, there is at least a half dozen. And I don't advocate tax incentives. I think the tax incentives would probably be a good idea, but IS Alliance lives in the world. We don't imagine that we are going to get tax relief for large corporations for security, even though I think it is a good idea. Politically, it probably isn't going to fly. But these other things ought to fly. We have done them, as I said, in a variety of other sectors. They passed. We really want to work with you on this. Mr. McCaul. We have a Sema-Tech in Austin and that is a great model. Just in the interest of time, because it is getting late. To the extent you can provide us additional information on what we can do at this level, what congressional action would be helpful to facilitate these incentives you are referring to; whether it be the contracting, whether it be the insurance, the information sharing? All these are great ideas that the chairman and I can look at in terms of crafting legislation that wouldn't be overburdensome in terms of regulating, but rather facilitating. Mr. Clinton. We have a good deal of material, Mr. McCaul, and we would be happy to share that with you and the Chairman and the rest of the committee and discuss it in greater detail at your convenience. Mr. McCaul. I certainly appreciate that. Thank you. Mr. Langevin. And I agree. I look forward to seeing your recommendations as well. The Chair now recognizes the chairwoman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. To your ranking member, to my ranking member, and to the staying power of the witnesses, let me thank you for accepting our invitation to become fixtures in this place. But you are doing it well and we thank you very much. Allow me to, I held up this large document that is the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. Let me just read into the record some language. Protection includes actions to mitigate the overall risk to the critical infrastructure and key resources assets, systems, networks, functions, or their interconnecting links resulting from exposure, injury, destruction, incapacitation or exploitation in the context of the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. This includes actions to deter the threat, mitigate vulnerabilities, or minimize consequences associated with a terrorist attack or other incident. And so we have our marching orders through this plan. And you are giving us sort of the wide perspective of the private sector. Can I get sort of a sentence answer from all of you, though this is cybersecurity? You heard individuals representing telecommunications and financial services on the first panel. Do you believe that, overall, the private sector has been engaged in actions to mitigate the risk to these assets systems and networks? And do you think there have been sufficient incentives for them to do that? And as we do that, I will ask my next question of what more once I hear where you are on that question. Ms. Katzen. And welcome. Ms. Katzen. Thank you. It is very good to see you. Ms. Jackson Lee. It is good to see you. Put that on the record. Ms. Katzen. Thank you. It is hard to know how much action has been taken because we have yet to develop meaningful quality metrics to measure. But one of the problems with the NIPP, the plan, is that it calls for information from the private sector, but you don't know what you are measuring against. We don't have benchmarks, we don't have metrics by which to make progress. I think a lot of work is being done. And much of it must be productive, but I am not able to sit here and tell you that it is or it isn't as long as we have a lack of a real partnership. And this is what I was trying to say earlier. DHS has got to work in a public-private partnership, public-public partnership in a way that is respectful and exploits the trusted relationships that exist, and that provides the--and I will go back to the incentives--provides incentives for the private sector to do the right thing. Right now, I think they are more in a ``do it my way'' or dictate to the SSAs as or the private sector what they should do, and I don't think that is as productive. Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I would say, first of all, with regard to your first question, is the private sector engaged? Yes, many people in the private sector are; however, not nearly enough. I participate on a number of these organizations. The outreach to the breadth of U.S. industry is, in my opinion, woefully inadequate. We need---- Ms. Jackson Lee. When you say breadth, you are going beyond even the cybersecurity? Mr. Clinton. No, Ms. Jackson Lee. I am speaking within the context of cybersecurity. Frankly, I think that probably would be true beyond cybersecurity. We are not reaching enough people with respect to being involved in these various plans. Ms. Jackson Lee. DHS is not reaching enough people? Mr. Clinton. Yes. And with respect to do they need more incentives, I am afraid the answer is yes. Now, certainly, as Dr. Gordon has pointed out, there are incentives. Lots of people are doing a lot of good things. That best practices group I was referring to before that was found in the PriceWaterhouseCoopers found about percent of corporations, many of the larger corporations. That is a lot of people, but that means percent are not being reached. And when we deal with the Internet, the weakest link is the problem. So that if we have the small businesses or the commercial sectors not being engaged at all, they are intertwined with everybody else and they can help bring down the whole system. We need a much more expansive effort. And the only motivator that is going to be dynamic enough to work is the profit motive. We have to inject that in. And you have got to remember, as somebody else pointed out before, it is not just a U.S. problem. The Internet is inherently international. So we need to reach out to the Indias and the Chinas and everybody else. We have to have some sort of system that is going to transcend that, and market incentives is the most logical one, which is why I think the three of us independently came to that conclusion. Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Gordon. Mr. Gordon. I would say that the private sector is clearly engaged. Clear evidence of that is the growing importance of setting up a chief security officer apart from the chief information officer within a company. You have now most of your major corporations have someone in charge of security who may report to the chief information officer or may even report directly to CFO. Are they doing enough? That is a tough one to answer, because in order to answer that one, you have got to really understand where they are and where they want to be. I can only give you my own experience, is I get contacted by at least one senior executive a week. And one of the biggest issues from a chief security officer's point of view is they want more security, okay, because not only is the company their concern but their job is their concern. So they have the option, they have an incentive. There is an agency problem; that is what we call it in economics. They have an incentive to overinvest. But the biggest problem they face is getting more funds out of the CFO for cybersecurity investments. So a little side note here is if you take a look at what companies invest, all the studies tend to show that companies invest somewhere around to percent of their IT budget on security. And the interesting thing about that is that security is becoming one of the fastest growing concerns, and the percentage of the budget for security is not growing. So that would suggest to me that they are not getting the share they should be getting. It suggests that to me; but without having the deed on particular companies, and I am sure it varies from company to company. Ms. Jackson Lee. My questions are never quick, but I am going to try to offer two more quick questions recognizing your time and the lateness of the hour. But what I would ask without having that answered, I would like to get from the witnesses your list of incentives that can be utilized more effectively through DHS. And I would like that in writing. But let me try to get Mr. Clinton, and then I have a question for Ms. Katzen and Mr. Gordon. You never were a fan in particular for the approach dealing with a regulatory scheme, if you will, I don't think. You were sort of interested in trying to, as you said, get DHS to be more enthusiastic on this best practices area. I am still looking at whether or not this should be a totally voluntary approach with incentives, or whether or not we need some regulatory structure, which I have heard my colleagues say and I too am looking at legislation along that line. I obviously have an array of infrastructure issues to look at. But what I would like to know is what has been your association in terms of being involved with DHS to promote the best practices so that they are more broadly adopted across the IT sector through this program. Have you been able to engage with DHS to talk about best practices? And I am just saying you in particular because you represent a component of the industry that I think is important. And, isn't this program a great way to encourage more effective cross-sector cybersecurity protection? Meaning this whole best practices. Have you been engaged in particular? Let me ask my other question to both Ms. Katzen and Mr. Gordon. I think cybersecurity gives value to companies. And it would look like that would be one of the industry incentives that, if my investors knew that I was managing my risk, that that would make my product more valuable. Question is, does Wall Street give value to cybersecurity so that companies then are self-rewarded for what they have done? And, in essence, does the government? Have they narrowed the rewards to even that way? Cybersecurity, more valuable, protect the America's assets? I will go to Mr. Clinton first on this whole best practices and interacting with the DHS. Mr. Clinton. Thank you, Ms. Jackson Lee. Yes. I, speaking as the Internet Security Alliance, am very involved. Ms. Jackson Lee. Is that the name of the program, so you will at least be--I will put it on the record. The Voluntary Private Sector Preparedness Certification Program. Mr. Clinton. Well, the Internet Security Alliance is very, very involved in developing best practices and finding incentives for our Members to use them. We do have an insurance incentive program with the largest insurance provider of cyber insurance for our best practices. We publish best practices basically once every year. We talked earlier about the model contracts that we provide. So we do on the private sector side a great deal with respect to developing best practices, providing incentives for best practices, et cetera. With respect to, is DHS the mode for that? I would have to tell you that we have not really found very much grounding in working with DHS in that regard. Most of the improvements in cybersecurity that I am aware of happen by the private sector doing things through the private sector, not through DHS. Maybe that will change as DHS matures. But to this point, I would have to tell you that none of my members would say that they are doing anything to improve their security thanks to DHS. They are doing it for other reasons; some are for social, some are business, for a variety of other things. But our view is that the infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. You have to work with the private sector to get it strengthened. When you strengthen that infrastructure, you are also fulfilling an important homeland security and national security function. But you do it through private sector. Going through DHS, I think you are really trying to stick a square peg in a round hole, and I think it is going to be counterproductive. Ms. Katzen. On the issue of both market value and Wall Street, and it is referred to in my testimony, the Ernst & Young study, which shows a very strong correlation between success in managing risks and success on Wall Street, and that investors do appreciate that. So I think there are data there that support that. Mr. Gordon. I would agree with that. Actually, if you take a look at my written testimony, I discuss this notion of what you call value added as opposed to cost savings from cybersecurity investments. It is usually thought of as sort of a secondary effect, but in the short run firms certainly can carve out a niche for themselves, a competitive advantage of showing they have more security than another firm. In the long run, it will be hard to keep that competitive advantage. I do discuss that point in my written testimony. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much to all of the witnesses. And, Mr. Chairman, it has been a pleasure to be able to unveil and to pull back the covers on what has either been happening or not been happening with DHS. And I think that there are some roads not yet traveled that we can work on, in particular public-public, public-private relationships and incentives rewards. Mr. Clinton, I don't want to leave DHS completely out and I am not convinced that they should be completely out or not, that they not be a regulatory structure. But I do believe that there should be rewards that you are aware of that are given through DHS, and apparently we have not established that structure yet. Mr. Clinton. I would agree with that, Ms. Jackson. Ms. Jackson Lee. And so, let me just thank Chairman Langevin. I look forward that we have an opportunity to work again together on this issue. And I yield back. Thank you all for your testimony. Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Madam Chair. Let me just say how much I appreciate your participation in this joint hearing, as well as Ranking Member Lungren. This was very productive, and some great things came out of it. I look forward to our continuing to work together. I also, of course, want to thank the panelists for your patience, for your testimony. You have added great insight into the work that we have ahead of us and perhaps a road map of what we need to do to better coordinate this effort of cybersecurity and working together with the public and the private sector. So I thank you for your testimony and the members for their questions. The members of the subcommittee may have additional questions for the witnesses, and we would ask that you respond expeditiously in writing to those questions. Hearing no further business--again, happy anniversary to you, Ms. Katzen. I hope you get home soon. And sorry for the lateness of the hour, but certainly an important issue. Hearing no further---- Ms. Jackson Lee. Happy anniversary. Mr. Chairman, would you allow a moment of personal privilege? Mr. Langevin. Certainly. Ms. Jackson Lee. Professor Katzen goes back with my combined family. My spouse, Dr. Elwyn Lee, he sends his greetings. Ms. Katzen. Thank you. Ms. Jackson Lee. And you allowed me a moment of reminiscing, and she is as young and vibrant. And I am apologetic. Go home for that anniversary, please. And greetings from myself and my husband. Congratulations. I thank you for giving me a moment of personal privilege. Mr. Langevin. Certainly. Ms. Jackson Lee. The check is on Chairman Langevin, so do whatever you want to do tonight. [Laughter.] Mr. Langevin. On that note, hearing no further business, the subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank you. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] For the Record Prepared Statement of Michael O'Hanlon Greetings. It is an honor to appear before the committee today. My opening comments will be brief and rather broad. I am not an expert on cybersecurity, hence my contribution today will involve creating a framework within which this important aspect of homeland security can be considered and analyzed. It is useful to think in terms of different possible strategies for homeland security. Clearly, in a society like ours, huge as it is, as open and free as it is, we could be far more diligent about protecting ourselves from terrorism than we are today. For example, if the degree of terrorist threat here was anything approaching that in Israel, or if even a single additional major attack had been successfully carried out since / , we would do things that are presently seen as politically infeasible or strategically unnecessary (such as searching baggage on most trains and buses, tightening up land borders far more, and worrying about truck bomb vulnerability at far more prominent buildings). But we are already much more diligent than we were before / , and are spending more than $ billion a year in federal funds on the effort (whereas a decade ago we spent perhaps one fifth as much on counterterrorism, and did not even employ the term homeland security in the federal lexicon). So our current strategy might be seen as an intermediate one along a spectrum of possible approaches. A notional list of a full spectrum of possible approaches to homeland security might look something like this, in ascending order of intensity and cost: Pre- / Approach. The philosophy here would be to protect only against very specific threats that have manifested themselves before, or that would be especially worrisome. For example, we protected nuclear power plants from sabotage, and top officials from assassination. The annual cost to the federal government is under $ billion for such an approach, roughly and notionally speaking. Post- / Threat-Based Approach. This approach would follow a similar logic but expand the list of credible threats based on what we learned on September , and in various events around the world since then. Jeremy Shapiro of Brookings is a proponent of this approach (see opportunity .org). Airline security is an obvious area of focus for this approach, which would emphasize prevention of what we know that al-Qa'ida and related groups CAN do, as opposed to what they might wish to do. Reducing our vulnerability to truck bombs at prominent sites is another logical area of emphasis, given known patterns of terrorist activity around the world. The annual cost is about $ billion to $ billion (my estimates). Bush Administration Approach. This goes beyond the threat-based approach to include as well attention to those types of attacks that we know al-Qa'ida would LIKE to carry out, as well as those that would be so horrible we have to worry that they might occur even if they probably will not (such as WMD attacks). Estimated annual cost $ billion. Brookings Approach. This approach, reflected in two Brookings studies this decade by a team of authors, is similar in some ways to the Bush administration's concept. But it takes a slightly broader approach to defining threats and toughens up the steps taken to address them in some cases. We focus primarily on attacks that could cause major damage to our national security, our population, or our economy (catastrophic attacks). For example, we emphasize better protection of the chemical industry and the hazardous trucking industry, as well as improved use of intelligence to find patterns of possible terrorist attack before they occur (a ``google function for counterterrorism'') along the lines also proposed by the Markle Foundation. Estimated yearly cost $ billion. ``America the Vulnerable'' approach. I borrow here from Stephen Flynn of the Council on Foreign Relations; former Bush administration homeland security official Clark Kent Ervin has written a somewhat similar book. The approach here is to take imagination to its logical extreme, and suppose that any serious attack al-Qa'ida might be able to carry out we should defend robustly against. It is a vulnerability-based approach, but with vulnerability defined in a broad way. Great attention is paid to inspecting cargo in international shipping by Flynn, for example, even though it could be very difficult to rework our port infrastructure to make this possible. Estimated cost $ billion a year. Council on Foreign Relations task force approach. This Hart-Rudman task force of several years ago reflected the logic of Flynn, who was involved with the project as well, and also placed particular emphasis on equipping and training most of America's millions of first responders to deal with WMD attacks and other catastrophes. About $ billion a year. Israel-style approach. If we had to worry about small bombs going off in most public places, a whole different level of effort would be required, with annual costs perhaps reaching $ billion (and many inconveniences introduced to daily life). This is a very short written testimony but I hope its succinctness will be of some use in providing a simple taxonomy for further discussion. I would be happy in particular to explain the Brookings approach, both in broad philosophy and in its specific recommendations. I am attaching as an appendix a chapter in a recent Brookings book I coauthored in . I have no reason to believe my coauthor's thinking has changed. However, given his current position, please assign responsibility for this ``republishing'' of material that first appeared a year and a half ago entirely to me.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Micahel d'Arcy, Michael O'Hanlon, Peter Orszag, Jeremy Shapiro, and James Steinberg, Protecting the Homeland / (Washington, D.C.: Brookings, ), pp. - . ??? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appendix: Protecting Infrastructure and Providing Incentives for the Private Sector to Protect Itself Since the attacks of September th, the private sector has generally not done nearly enough to improve its security against terrorist attack. For example, the Congressional Budget Office recently concluded that ``there is relatively little evidence that firms have been making additional investments since September to improve their security and avoid losses.'' \ \ About percent of the nation's critical infrastructure is owned by the private sector, and security had typically not been sufficient before the attacks, so the failure to materially improve security measures in many key industries represents one of the most glaring and dangerous shortcomings in the nation's response to the terrorist attacks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Congressional Budget Office, ``Federal Terrorism Reinsurance: An Update,'' January , . Some industries (such as transportation, energy, utilities, and financial services) have increased spending modestly. See Benjamin Weiser and Claudia H. Deutsch, ``Many Offices Holding the Line on Post- / Security Outlays,'' New York Times, August , ; and the Conference Board, Corporate Security Management: Organization and Spending Since / (New York: The Conference Board, ), p. . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The key to improved security in the private sector is structuring incentives properly: Markets respond to incentives. But to date, the federal government has done little to alter firms' incentives for protecting most private sector infrastructure from terrorist attack. Apart from efforts to protect those types of infrastructure that have already been attacked, such as commercial airliners, the Administration's policy has been very restrained. Part of its reluctance to intervene may be a reflection of the admittedly daunting nature of the task--and the impossibility of knowing exactly which types of infrastructure to protect to what standards of robustness. But the Administration's laissez-faire approach also risks leaving undefended targets within the United States that could nonetheless cause catastrophic harm. The greatest concerns apply to key pieces of private infrastructure--chemical facilities, skyscrapers, other large buildings, many hospitals, and so on. Such infrastructure is predominately owned by the private sector, but is critical to the functioning of our broader society. Protection of the public is not always consistent with private incentives in such settings. Given existing incentives, economic logic suggests that owners of key infrastructure will, from the point of view of the broader public interest, underinvest in security precautions.\ \ At present, many industries see counterterrorism protection as a costly way to provide an uncertain degree of protection against an unlikely threat. There are few perceived benefits and many costs to improving security. As Frank Cilluffo, former Special Assistant to the President for Homeland Security in the Bush administration puts it: ``We need to be able to spur [that] investment by providing incentives. Right now, the incentives are disincentives.'' \ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Peter R. Orszag, ``Homeland Security and the Private Sector,'' Testimony before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, November , . \ \ Frank Cilluffo, ``The Mission of Homeland Security,'' The NYU Review of Law and Security: Are We Safer?, Issue No. (Fall ), p. . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Private markets by themselves do not generate sufficient incentives for homeland security, and government intervention can therefore be warranted, for several reasons. Most broadly, national security is a core constitutional responsibility of the federal government. Even if a given terrorist attack only affects private property, it can have broader ramifications for the country's sense of safety. In the terminology of economists, such an attack imposes a `` negative externality.'' The presence of this negative externality means that private markets will undertake less investment in security than would be socially desirable: Individuals or firms deciding how best to protect themselves against terrorism are unlikely to take the external costs of an attack fully into account, and therefore will generally provide an inefficiently low level of security against terrorism on their own.\ \ Without government involvement, private markets will thus typically under-invest in anti-terrorism measures.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ It is also possible, at least in theory, for private firms to invest too much in anti-terrorism security. In particular, visible security measures (such as more uniformed guards) undertaken by one firm may merely displace terrorist attacks onto other firms, without significantly affecting the overall probability of an attack. In such a scenario, the total security precautions undertaken can escalate beyond the socially desirable levels--and government intervention could theoretically improve matters by placing limits on how much security firms would undertake. Unobservable security precautions (which are difficult for potential terrorists to detect), on the other hand, do not displace vulnerabilities from one firm to another and can at least theoretically reduce the overall level of terrorism activity. For an interesting application of these ideas to the Lojack automobile security system, see Ian Ayres and Steven Levitt, ``Measuring Positive Externalities from Unobservable Victim Precaution: An Empirical Analysis of Lojack,'' Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. , no. (February ). For further analysis of evaluating public policy in the presence of externalities, see Peter Orszag and Joseph Stiglitz, ``Optimal Fire Departments: Evaluating Public Policy in the Face of Externalities,'' Brookings Institution Working Paper, January . \ \ The Coase theorem shows that under very restrictive conditions, the negative externality can be corrected by voluntary private actions even if the role of government is limited to enforcing property rights. But the Coase theorem requires that all affected parties are able to negotiate at sufficiently low cost with each other. Since virtually the entire nation could be affected indirectly by a terrorist attack, the costs of negotiation are prohibitive, making the Coase theorem essentially irrelevant in the terrorism context. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Second, a more specific negative externality exists with regard to inputs into terrorist activity. For example, loose security at a chemical facility can provide terrorists with the materials they need for an attack. Similarly, poor security at a biological laboratory can provide terrorists with access to dangerous pathogens. The costs of allowing terrorists to obtain access to such materials are generally not borne by the facilities themselves: the attacks that use the materials could occur elsewhere. Such a specific negative externality provides a compelling rationale for government intervention to protect highly explosive materials, chemicals, and biological pathogens even if they are stored in private facilities. In particular, preventing access to such materials is likely to reduce the overall risk of catastrophic terrorism, as opposed to merely displacing it from one venue to another. Third, a related type of externality involves ``contamination effects.'' Contamination effects arise when a catastrophic risk faced by one firm is determined in part by the behavior of others, and the behavior of these others affects the incentives of the first firm to reduce its exposure to the risk. Such interdependent security problems can arise, for example, in network settings. The problem in these settings is that the risk to any member of a network depends not only on its own security precautions but also on those taken by others. Poor security at one establishment can affect security at others. The result can often be weakened incentives for security precautions.\ \ For example, once a hacker or virus reaches one computer on a network, the remaining computers can more easily be contaminated. This possibility reduces the incentive for any individual computer operator to protect against outside hackers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ See Howard Kunreuther and Geoffrey Heal, ``Interdependent Security,'' Journal of Risk and Uncertainty : - (March/May ), and Howard Kunreuther, Geoffrey Heal, and Peter Orszag, ``Interdependent Security: Implications for Homeland Security Policy and Other Areas,'' Policy Brief # , Brookings Institution, October . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Even stringent cyber-security may not be particularly helpful if a hacker has already entered the network through a ``weak link.'' A fourth potential motivation for government intervention involves information--in particular, the cost and difficulty of accurately evaluating security measures. For example, one reason that governments promulgate building codes is that it would be too difficult for each individual entering a building to evaluate its structural soundness. Since it would also be difficult for the individual to evaluate how well the building's air intake system could filter out potential bio- terrorist attacks, the same logic would suggest that the government should set minimum anti-terrorism standards for buildings if there were some reasonable threat of a terrorist attack on the relevant type of buildings (so that the individual would have some interest in ensuring that the building were protected against biological attack). Similarly, it would be possible, but inefficient, for each individual to conduct extensive biological anti-terrorism safety tests on the food that he or she was about to consume. The information costs associated with that type of system, however, make it much less attractive than a system of government regulation of food safety. The fifth justification for government intervention is that corporate and individual financial exposures to the losses from a major terrorist attack are inherently limited by the bankruptcy laws. For example, assume that there are two types of possible terrorist attacks on a specific firm: A very severe attack and a somewhat more modest one. Under either type of attack, the losses imposed would exceed the firm's net assets, and the firm would declare bankruptcy--and therefore the extent of the losses beyond that which would bankrupt the firm would be irrelevant to the firm's owners. Since the outcome for the firm's owners would not depend on the severity of the attack, the firm would have little or no incentive to reduce the likelihood of the more severe version of the attack even if the required preventive steps were relatively inexpensive. From society's perspective, however, such security measures may be beneficial--and government intervention can therefore be justified to address catastrophic possibilities in the presence of the bankruptcy laws. The sixth justification for government intervention is that the private sector may expect the government to bail it out should a terrorist attack occur. The financial assistance to the airline industry provided by the government following the September th attacks provides just one example of such bailouts. Such expectations create a ``moral hazard'' problem: private firms, expecting the government to bail them out should an attack occur, do not undertake as much security as they otherwise would. If the government cannot credibly convince the private sector that no bailouts will occur after an attack, it may have to intervene before an attack to offset the adverse incentives created by the expectation of a bailout. The final justification for government intervention involves incomplete markets. The most relevant examples involve imperfections in capital and insurance markets. For example, if insurance firms are unable to obtain reinsurance coverage for terrorism risks (that is, if primary insurers are not able to transfer some of the risk from terrorism costs to other insurance firms in the reinsurance market), some government involvement may be warranted. In addition, certain types of activities may require large-scale coordination, which may be possible but difficult to achieve without governmental intervention. These market shortcomings provide a justification for targeted government intervention. But providing a high degree of protection for all possible targets would be prohibitively expensive and practically impossible. Focusing on high-impact attacks helps to narrow the range of private-sector settings in which government intervention is warranted. When government intervention is needed, the best approach is to use government regulation to alter incentives for the private sector for better protecting itself. This can be done either by providing firms with certain advantages when they adopt appropriate measures (the carrot approach), or by imposing costs on those who fail to adopt such measures (the stick approach). In both cases, the goal would be the same: to introduce a difference in the cost of one activity compared to another, accomplished either by reducing the cost of the first activity (e.g., an investment in security) or by raising the cost of the second activity (e.g., business as usual). For example, consider the case of trucking. Truck drivers can be subjected to more intensive background searches, and advanced technologies can be used to monitor trucks and ensure the security of their cargo in real time. The government could directly subsidize such steps, for example by providing tax credits to firms that adopt them. Or it could mandate insurance for trucking firms, thereby relying on insurances firms to impose costs (e.g., through higher premiums) on firms that fail to adopt appropriate security measures. The government could also combine either of these approaches with some form of regulation, such as allowing better protected cargo trucks to travel closer to population centers than less protected trucks, thereby providing time and money savings to the firms that invest in protecting their trucks. The key distinction between the ``carrot'' and the ``stick'' approaches is who pays. Government subsidies or tax credits spread the cost of homeland security spending in a particular private market across the entire population, rather than the stakeholders (the owners of businesses, the workers, and consumers of the product) in that sector itself. The stick approach--either through regulation or insurance, or some combination thereof--instead concentrates its costs on the stakeholders in that sector. If particular sectors are inherently more dangerous than others, we as a society may want to encourage activity in other, safer sectors where we have a choice-- which would be better accomplished by having stakeholders in the sector bear the full cost of protection. The reason is that imposing the cost on the stakeholders rather than the general public would raise the costs of the most dangerous activities. The market would thus discourage such activities (through higher prices), which would help to mitigate the risk of a terrorist attack in the most dangerous sectors. Before turning to a discussion of specific industries, we first examine these generic approaches to improving security in the private sector. SUBSIDIES Perhaps the most obvious way of strengthening incentives for protective measures in the private sector is to provide a government subsidy. For example, some policy-makers have proposed tax credits for security measures. This approach, however, is generally flawed, and not just because of the substantial budget imbalance facing the nation. Subsidies or tax credits can encourage unnecessarily expensive investments in security measures (or ``gold plating''). The problem is particularly severe in the case of investments that provide protection against terrorist attack but also have substantial other benefits to firms. Even if they don't encourage firms to undertake excessively costly investments with minimal homeland security benefits, subsidies or tax credits can provide benefits to firms that would have undertaken the investments even in the absence of the tax subsidy--raising the budget cost without providing any additional security. In other words, subsidies or tax credits ``buy out the base'' of what firms are already doing to protect themselves against terrorist attack. Subsidies or tax credits also do a poor job of differentiating between high-risk and lower-risk sectors, yet the degree of government intervention should clearly vary by circumstance. In other words, designing and implementing subsidies or tax credits is likely to be just as cumbersome and inefficient as designing direct regulations. INSURANCE AS A MECHANISM FOR IMPROVING INCENTIVES An alternative is to provide incentives for better security through the insurance system. At first glance, terrorism insurance may seem counterproductive: Firms and individuals with insurance against terrorist attack would appear to lack incentives to take appropriate precautions against an attack. However, where such insurance is available, it typically comes with provisions (such as a deductible) to ensure that the insured bear at least some of the cost of an attack, and thus have an economic incentive to avoid such attacks or minimize their consequences. More important, the insurance companies themselves have an incentive to encourage risk-reducing activities. Indeed, insurance firms are well positioned to provide incentives for mitigation efforts--for firms to take steps ahead of time to protect themselves against terrorist attack. The terrorism insurance market could thus guide protective efforts. Best practices would be encouraged through graduated rate structures for insurance that encourage individual owners to adopt prudent and cost-effective technologies and procedures for protecting their assets and the people within them. Three critical questions arise with regard to the use of insurance in this way. The first is whether firms will voluntarily purchase the insurance. Terrorism insurance coverage among large firms has expanded noticeably: take-up rates were quite low in but nearly doubled in , reaching almost half of large firms in mid .\ \ Despite the recent increases, however, take-up of terrorism insurance remains well below percent.\ \ In the absence of universal take-up, at least among firms that own critical infrastructure, the incentives provided by the insurance industry would be much less likely to produce adequate risk reduction. Furthermore, voluntary insurance markets often suffer from classic problems of ``adverse selection,'' in which firms that are riskier are the ones that are more likely to purchase insurance, creating a potential spiral of rising premiums and reduced take-up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Congressional Budget Office, ``Federal Terrorism Reinsurance: An Update,'' January , ; and Erwann Michel-Kerjan and Burkhard Pedell, ``Terrorism Risk Coverage in the post- / Era: A Comparison of Public-Private Partnerships in France, Germany, and the U.S,'' Risk Management and Decision Processes Center, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Working Paper , October , . \ \ Some economists argue that many firms should not insure themselves against terrorist attack, since the owners of the firm can mostly if not entirely diversify that risk. Kent Smetters, ``Insuring Against Terrorism: The Policy Challenge,'' NBER Working Paper , January . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The shortcomings with voluntary terrorism insurance raise the question of whether insurance should be mandatory--at least for large firms or key sectors. Mandatory insurance would not only facilitate risk-mitigation efforts on a broader scale and allow the insurance industry to spread its risks more effectively, but would also reduce the likely demands on government following any attack in the future.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Howard Kunreuther and Erwann Michel-Kerjan, ``Policy Watch: Challenges for Terrorism Risk Insurance in the United States,'' Journal of Economic Perspectives, Volume , Number , Fall , . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In France, terrorism insurance is mandatory.\ \ Former Deputy Homeland Security Adviser Richard Falkenrath has suggested that Congress mandate that terrorism insurance be included in all commercial insurance policies.\ \ In our view, terrorism insurance should indeed be required on all commercial policies, perhaps above some minimum threshold of several million dollars to avoid unnecessary administrative costs in settings unlikely to cause high-impact terrorist damage. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Erwann Michel-Kerjan and Burkhard Pedell, ``Terrorism Risk Coverage in the post- / Era: A Comparison of Public-Private Partnerships in France, Germany, and the U.S,'' Risk Management and Decision Processes Center, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Working Paper , October . \ \ Statement of Richard A. Falkenrath before the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, January , . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The second question is whether the insurance industry will be able to develop the tools for evaluating terrorism risk. Models of terrorism risk at the level of zip codes or specific locations are now available from firms such as Risk Management Systems, EQECAT, and Applied Insurance Research Worldwide.\ \ These models represent significant advances; they are, however, inherently limited not only by the paucity of historical data on terrorist attacks but also by the difficulties in predicting how terrorist behavior will evolve over time. For example, one model assumes that risk is mostly concentrated in high visibility targets; another assumes that attacks at low visibility targets could be employed to sow confusion and broad fears.\ \ The key issue is not whether the models are fully reliable; they clearly are not.\ \ Instead, the fundamental question is whether the models could become good enough to provide the basis for an insurance-oriented approach to protective efforts. From this perspective, especially compared to an alternative of failing to provide incentives for private efforts or relying exclusively on government regulation, the models seem relatively insightful. And it should be possible for them to be informed by government risk analyses as well. Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD ) requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate national protection efforts in infrastructure sectors such as information technology, telecommunications, transportation, and the chemical industry, and requires the government as a whole to prioritize protection activities.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Congressional Budget Office, ``Federal Terrorism Reinsurance: An Update,'' January , . \ \ Congressional Budget Office, ``Federal Terrorism Reinsurance: An Update,'' January , . \ \ The insurance industry operates in many areas in which models are nowhere close to fully reliable, including tort cases. See Kent Smetters, ``Insuring Against Terrorism: The Policy Challenge,'' NBER Working Paper , January . \ \ President George W. Bush, ``Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD : Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection,'' December , , available at www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/ / /print/ - .htlm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A final question is whether the insurance industry requires a government backstop to play the role envisioned for it here. Some economists argue that the risks can be spread across private financial markets without government intervention.\ \ Other economists and market observers, however, argue that capital market imperfections impede the ability of insurers to provide coverage against catastrophic risks, such as those involved in terrorist activities. In such a case, a government backstop may be required. Alan Greenspan, for example, has testified that he has ``yet to be convinced'' that the terrorism insurance market could operate effectively without a government backstop.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Kent Smetters, ``Insuring Against Terrorism: The Policy Challenge,'' NBER Working Paper , January . See also Appendix B in Congressional Budget Office, ``Federal Terrorism Reinsurance: An Update,'' January . \ \ ``Senators Trying Again To Extend Terrorism Insurance Plan,'' CongressDaily, February , . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The most pressing issue involves the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), enacted in November . TRIA is scheduled to expire on December , , and policymakers are debating whether it should be extended. Under TRIA, insurance firms are required to offer terrorism coverage, and the government agrees to pay a specified share of the insured losses in the event of a terrorist attack.\ \ Although some form of federal backstop should be extended past , significant changes in the existing program are warranted.\ \ A substantial flaw with the current program is that no fee is imposed by the government for the backstop. (The government would recover a certain amount of its losses after the fact, but through a surcharge on all commercial policies, rather than only on those with terrorism insurance components. As a result, the government program effectively subsidizes terrorism insurance, with all commercial policyholders potentially liable to pay for part of the subsidy.) A better approach would have the government charge a premium based on how much protection the insurance firm itself wants; the government should continue, though, only to provide coverage against extreme losses.\ \ Losses below the catastrophic level should be covered entirely by private markets. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ For a description, see Congressional Budget Office, ``Federal Terrorism Reinsurance: An Update,'' January . \ \ See also Swiss Re, ``Terrorism Risks in Property Insurance and Their Insurability After September , '' ( ). \ \ For one explanation of how various layers of insurance could be provided, including a government layer for catastrophic losses, see Howard Kunreuther and Erwann Michel-Kerjan, ``Policy Watch: Challenges for Terrorism Risk Insurance in the United States,'' Journal of Economic Perspectives, Volume , Number , Fall . A MIXED SYSTEM WITH INSURANCE AND REGULATIONS An insurance-based system could be combined with a larger policy of regulatory standards and third-party inspections. A mixed regulatory- insurance system is already applied in many other areas, such as owning a home or driving a car. Local building codes specify minimum standards that homes must meet. But mortgages generally require that homes also carry home insurance, and insurance companies provide incentives for improvements beyond the building code level--for example, by providing a reduction in the premiums they charge if the homeowner installs a security system. Similarly, governments specify minimum standards that drivers must meet in order to operate a motor vehicle. But they also require drivers to carry liability insurance for accidents arising out of the operation of their vehicles. Meanwhile, insurance companies provide incentives for safer driving by charging higher premiums to those with poorer driving records.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ To be sure, crucial differences exist between the terrorist case and these other examples. For example, stable actuarial data exist for home and auto accidents, but not for terrorist attacks. Nonetheless, it may be possible for insurers to distinguish risks of loss based on differences in damage exposures, given a terrorist incident. Some financial firms are already trying to devise basic frameworks for evaluating such risks. See, for example, Moody's Investors Service, ``Moody's Approach to Terrorism Insurance for U.S. Commercial Real Estate,'' March , . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A mixed system of minimum standards coupled with an insurance mandate not only can encourage actors to act safely, but also can provide incentives for innovation to reduce the costs of achieving any given level of safety. The presence of minimum regulatory standards also helps to attenuate the moral hazard effect from insurance: Moral hazard arises when firms, knowing that they are insured against terrorist losses, take less care in protecting against attack. Minimum standards could also provide guidance to courts in determining negligence under liability laws.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ For a discussion of the potential benefits of a mixed system of building code regulations and mandatory catastrophic risk insurance in the context of natural disasters, see Peter Diamond, ``Comment on Catastrophic Risk Management,'' in Kenneth Froot, ed., The Financing of Catastrophe Risk (University of Chicago Press: Chicago, ), pages - . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A mixed system also has the advantage of being flexible, a key virtue in an arena where new threats will be ``discovered'' on an ongoing basis. In situations in which insurance firms are particularly unlikely to provide proper incentives to the private sector for efficient risk reduction (for example, because insurers lack experience in these areas), regulation can play a larger role. Third-party inspections can be coupled with insurance protection to encourage companies to reduce the risk of accidents and disasters. Under such schemes, insurance corporations would hire third-party inspectors to evaluate the safety and security of plants seeking insurance cover. Passing the inspection would indicate to the community and government that a firm complies with safety and security regulations. The firm would also benefit from reduced insurance premiums, since the insurer would have more confidence in the safety and security of the firm. This system takes advantage of two potent market mechanisms to make firms safer, while freeing government resources to focus on the largest risks. Insurance firms have a strong incentive to make sure that the inspections are rigorous and that the inspected firms are safe, since they bear the costs of an accident or terrorist attack. Private sector inspections also reduce the number of audits the regulatory agency itself must undertake, allowing the government to focus its resources more effectively on those companies that it perceives to pose the highest risks. The more firms decide to take advantage of private third-party inspections, the greater the chances that high-risk firms will be audited by the regulatory agency. Studies have shown how such a program could be implemented in practice. In Delaware and Pennsylvania, the State Departments of Environmental Protection have worked closely with the insurance industry and chemical plants to test this approach for chemical facility safety.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ For further information, see Howard Kunreuther, Patrick McNulty, and Yong Kang, ``Improving Environmental Safety Through Third Party Inspection,'' Risk Analysis. : - , . REQUIRED STEPS IN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS The steps required to improve security vary across industries. In keeping with the principles we set forth in chapter one, it is important to find ways to maximize protection, particularly against catastrophic attack, in cost-effective ways and where possible in a manner that provides additional benefits outside the homeland security realm. But applying these principles to specific industries and sectors requires considerable detailed technical analysis on a case by case basis. One common theme in much of the below, however, is that appropriate safeguards are often expensive to implement immediately but relatively painless to build into new systems. For example, given that al-Qa'ida appears to have considerable interest in biological agent attacks, and given the continued difficulty of treating the symptoms of biological attacks quickly and effectively (especially on a large scale), it behooves the United States to adopt defensive measures where cost- effective.\ \ Air intakes on buildings can be put well above street level and beyond the reach of anyone without access to restricted areas.\ \ Filters might be built into air circulation systems, to impede the distribution of any chemical or biological agent introduced into a building (and a slight overpressure maintained within buildings to reduce the risk that agents will infiltrate from the outside).\ \ Addition of filters may sometimes only be practical when entire heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are being replaced.\ \ Still, over time, considerable progress is quite feasible. Many modern heating and air circulation systems have the kinds of sensors, adaptable flows, and other features that could help protect against the effects of terrorist attack as well as optimize a building's functioning and the quality of its air in normal times.\ \ This shows how measures taken in part to promote homeland security can have other benefits. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Judith Miller, ``U.S. Has New Concerns About Anthrax Readiness,'' New York Times, December , , p.

Sometimes it is a matter of adopting simple steps of limited but useful impact. For example, elevators might be built so as to descend to the nearest floor in the event of a power outage--a wise investment against the possibility of electricity overloading as well. (In the public sector, relatedly, street lights could be given low-energy diode emitters powered by batteries as backups to main power systems.\ \) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Peter Fairley, ``The Unruly Power Grid,'' IEEE Spectrum (August ), pp. - . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Truck bombs will remain a threat in the future; they have been the weapon of choice of al-Qa'ida in most attacks since / . Defending against them can involve constructing new, prominent buildings a certain distance back from streets--as has occurred with a number of new U.S. embassies in recent years. Further desirable measures, at least for the highest-profile buildings, can involve using shatterproof glass or comparable coatings in the lower floors of such buildings, and closing or at least inspecting entrants into underground parking garages. Relatedly, one might worry about large bombs being assembled piece by piece through the use of individual bags to carry explosives into buildings. This threat may argue for controlling access to symbolically important buildings in particular. At present, outside of New York, very few major buildings have any checks or controls on entry.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Terry Pristin, ``Different Cities, Different Security for Buildings,'' New York Times, July , , p.

Doing so should be the highest critical infrastructure protection priority for the Department of Homeland Security in the next two years.'' \ \ A DHS study that ranked a terrorist act releasing chlorine, along with nuclear and anthrax attacks, as among the most deadly plausible scenarios for the United States to worry about in the future gives further credence to Falkenrath's view.\ \ As we argue in chapter one, it is precisely such types of vulnerabilities that demand the most urgent attention. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ For further discussion of homeland security and the chemical industry, see Congressional Budget Office, ``Homeland Security and the Private Sector,'' Chapter (Chemicals and Hazardous Materials), December . \ \ Statement of Richard A. Falkenrath before the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, January , . \ \ Eric Lipton, ``U.S. Report Lists Possibilities for Terrorist Attacks and Likely Toll,'' New York Times, March , , p. . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Voluntary measures have been adopted by some chemical plants, notably those of the American Chemistry Council, but these represent a minority of the nation's total such facilities. Hardening plants against sophisticated attacks by well-trained bands of terrorists, and other such robust safeguards, could be uneconomical and in many cases unnecessary. There are thousands of chemicals produced in the United States, but only some that are very dangerous and about half that number that are most extreme in the threats they pose. There are tens of thousands of chemical plants but only , to , where the improper release of agent could kill , or more individuals.\ \ But a more systematic approach that at least requires periodic assessments of vulnerabilities and common-sense solutions is imperative.\ \ Senator Corzine introduced a bill to do just that but it has not been passed by the Congress.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Richard D. Farmer, Homeland Security and the Private Sector (Washington, D.C.: Congressional Budget Office, December ), pp. -- . \ \ Government Accountability Office, Homeland Security: Voluntary Initiatives Are Under Way at Chemical Facilities, but the Extent of Security Preparedness Is Unknown, GAO- - (March ), summary page. \ \ Office of Senator Jon S. Corzine, ``Fact Sheet on Senator Corzine's Chemical Security Legislation,'' November , , available at www.corzine.senate.gov/priorities/chem _sec.html; and Rick Hind and David Halperin, ``Lots of Chemicals, Little Reaction,'' New York Times, September , , p. A . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- There are also situations where less dangerous chemicals can be used in place of highly toxic ones. Reducing dependence on chlorine for drinking water purification is the most notable example. In these cases, the good sense of chemical plant owners combined with the guiding hand of the insurance market are the ideal mechanisms for improving safety.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ A related topic concerns the safeguards applied to the sales of certain lethal chemicals. Not enough has yet been done to ensure proper oversight in this regard. For example, a full decade after the Oklahoma City tragedy, only three states have notable regulations on the sale of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. Oklahoma joined South Carolina and Nevada in requiring requiring presentation of identification from anyone wishing such fertilizer and tracking sales of such materials to allow for investigation of any problems that may result. Others should follow this lead. In such cases where simple, common-sense, minimal- cost regulations can be devised, they are hardly inconsistent with the general approach advocated here of using market incentives where possible but mixed approaches including some regulation when sensible. See Associated Press, ``National Briefing--Oklahoma: Rules to Regulate Selling of Fertilizer,'' New York Times, February , , p. A . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another key challenge is securing nuclear materials.\ \ Power plants are now protected fairly well. But the cooling ponds used for storage of spent fuel may not be protected against certain types of attacks (such as from airplanes).\ \ Nor are many areas where low- medium-grade waste is stored. These latter materials can be used in ``dirty bombs.'' While such weapons might not kill large numbers, they could cause enormous economic costs (due to cleanup) and disruption (if a city center or other important area could not be used while being cleaned). Here the most practical defense is much improved security for sites where such materials are found, at home and abroad.\ \ In this type of case, where the optimal safety features are not obvious, regulation may be less desirable than reliance on insurance market incentives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ See Congressional Budget Office, ``Homeland Security and the Private Sector,'' Chapter (Civilian Nuclear Power), December . \ \ Shankar Vedantam, ``Storage of Nuclear Spent Fuel Criticized,'' Washington Post, March , , p. . \ \ Peter D. Zimmerman and Cheryl Loeb, ``Dirty Bombs: The Threat Revisited,'' Defense Horizons, no. (Washington, D.C.: National Defense University, January ); and Joby Warrick, ``Smugglers Targeting Dirty Bombs for Profit,'' Washington Post, November , , p. . Passenger Trains, Buses, and Boats On March , , a simple terrorist strike against trains in Madrid killed some people and injured another , . The July , London attacks, killing more than themselves, underscored that Madrid was not a fluke. This worry applies not only to trains, but in similar ways to buses, ferries, and cruise ships. Yet not nearly as much attention has been given to this issue as, for example, to airplane security.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Arnold M. Howitt and Jonathan Makler, ``On the Ground: Protecting America's Roads and Transit Against Terrorism,'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings, ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Several experimental efforts have been made to monitor passengers and cargo entering American trains. However, such efforts tend to rely heavily on labor-intensive methods such dogs to detect explosives. The challenge is the speed at which people must move through such stations, and the number of passengers involved, particularly for heavily traveled local train services and subways.\ \ For example, the New York subway system carries nearly million passengers a day (getting on and off at stations); all America's airports handle just . million people a day between them.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Baronet Media Ltd., ``Washington Tests High Security System for Trains,'' Vigilo Risk, issue # , June , , p. . \ \ Gregg Easterbrook, ``In an Age of Terror, Safety Is Relative,'' New York Times, June , , p. . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Some additional safeguards are desirable for trains and buses. Emergency communications systems can be improved, stations protected by perimeter fencing and guards and monitoring, relevant tunnels hardened, and spot checking made more common. Further federal funding is appropriate here; insurance markets are unlikely to be of much help since much train infrastructure is publicly owned.\ \ The American Public Transportation Association has called for over $ billion in added funding for mass transit systems including trains over the next three years--thirty times the expenditures of the last three years combined.\ \ Indeed, there is a strong case for substantial funding increases.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Baronet Media Ltd., ``House Committee Seeks $ Billion for U.S. Rail Security,'' Vigilo Risk, issue # , June , , p. . \ \ David Randall Peterman, ``Passenger Rail Security: Overview of Issues,'' CRS Report for Congress (Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, July , ), pp. -- . \ \ Nicole Gaouette, ``Senate is Split on Spending Bill for Domestic Security,'' Los Angeles Times, July , . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- But the $ billion added amount strikes us as too much. More logical is a gradual, incremental increase that continually evaluates the benefits of new and experimental measures as they are introduced. The fact of the matter is that, almost independent of expenditure levels, security will not be perfect on trains and buses. Controlling access of all passengers at all times seems unrealistic. Tightened security measures can be used for special events or in the case of intelligence alerts suggesting particular cause for concern. For example, police officers were put on every subway train in New York the day after the July , London bombings.\ \ But alas this vulnerability is one of those so difficult to address that it underscores the need for preventive homeland security activities-border patrols, prevention efforts by police departments and the FBI, and so forth--as well as continued intelligence operations and offensive action abroad. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Sewell Chan, ``In Added Security Measure, Officers are Riding the Rails,'' New York Times, July , . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A Democratic attempt to add $ . billion to the budget for rail security failed in the Congress.\ \ The Democratic idea was sound but the amount was, for the reasons noted above, probably too much. That said, an increase in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars would have been appropriate, and should be pursued for the budget. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ David Rogers, ``Homeland Budget Accord Is Reached,'' Wall Street Journal, September , , p. . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The situation is similar for passenger ships and ferries. Some improvements in security are warranted, but that said, vulnerability is a fact of life.\ \ Given that most such attacks, however tragic they might be, would not be catastrophic in the terms we use in chapter one, a cost-benefit analysis--and the state of available technology and procedures for security--suggest that only limited investments of the type already underway are warranted at this time.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ In addition to the threat of explosives being placed in cars, or planted directly on ferries and other ships, there is a risk of scuba divers attacking ships. See Jim Gomez, ``Terror Plots May Reach New Depths,'' Chicago Tribune, March , . Sometimes certain risky ports or waterways can be avoided overseas, but clearly this is not a protection method of complete reliability. See David Wood, ``Terrorism Fears Divert Navy Supply Ships from Suez Canal,'' Newhouse.com, January , . \ \ Eric Lipton, ``Trying to Keep the Nation's Ferries Safe from Terrorists,'' New York Times, March , , p. . Cargo Trains, Trucks, and Barges Carrying Hazardous Materials Trucks, trains, and barges are the chief methods for the transport of hazardous materials in the United States today. On the issue of trucks, at present there are few restrictions on who can drive the trucks and where those trucks can go--except of course that as a matter of public safety, tunnels and certain other very specific sections of road are sometimes deemed off limits to certain classes of highly toxic or flammable materials. Background checks have been begun for drivers of especially dangerous classes of chemicals and other substances. But efforts to authenticate their identities using identification with biometric indicators remain in the pilot, testing stage.\ \ Moreover, Mexican and Canadian drivers on American roads are not being checked in the same way.\ \ Some municipalities have similarly decided to find substitutes for the most lethal sorts of chemicals often carried by trucks (such as chlorine) when possible. Some companies train their employees in security precautions and monitor key facilities such as fuel depots. But these efforts are at present scattershot.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ William H. Robinson, Jennifer E. Lake, and Lisa M. Seghetti, ``Border and Transportation Security: Possible New Directions and Policy Options,'' CRS Report for Congress (Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, March , ), pp. -- . \ \ Transportation Security Administration, information at www.tsa.gov/public/display?content= d fd &print=yes, accessed January , . \ \ See David Johnston and Andrew C. Revkin, ``Officials Say Their Focus Is on Car and Truck Bombs,'' New York Times, August , , p. A . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This situation is highly imprudent. Leaving aside the issue of truck bombs, many trucks carry potentially lethal materials that could kill thousands if dissipated in densely congested parts of cities. To reduce the risks, several steps can be taken. First, for those drivers transporting anything from gasoline to chlorine, background checks must be done comprehensively and quickly. Names and fingerprints must be compared to entries on terror watchlists. Second, truck storage yards must meet minimal safety standards limiting access and monitoring perimeters. Third, safety features should be used on the doors of relevant trucks--reducing the odds that dangerous materials would be stolen for subsequent use in a terrorist attack. Given the danger of the materials involved, not just to the drivers of the trucks and others directly involved but to society on the whole, minimal safety standards are important enough to be done by regulation rather than relying entirely on the insurance markets. As an additional precaution, trucks carrying certain highly toxic substances should be banned from the most central parts of cities-- unless escorted by security and outfitted with tracking technology as well as automatic braking technology.\ \ Economic incentives would thus come into play, with firms measuring the costs of protective technology against the economic benefits of being granted greater access to densely populated regions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Flynn, America the Vulnerable, pp. -- . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The chlorine gas tragedy in South Carolina in January of underscored the need for upgrades to security in this realm as well. Several types of improvements are needed. As the South Carolina accident underscored, both would have benefits for general public health beyond the subject of counterterrorism, reducing the risks of routine accidents. Since it is a dual-benefit program, it serves one of main goals we suggest in chapter one for guiding future homeland security efforts. When substitution of dangerous chemicals by safer chemicals cannot happen, specific trains should be rerouted away from the centers of cities when necessary and practical. In early , the District of Columbia prohibited shipments of hazardous materials through parts of the nation's capital. A more systematic national effort is appropriate as well.\ \ (The most lethal substances should be banned outright from city centers; others could be permitted, as noted above, when companies adopt best practices on safety such as automatic tracking and braking technology on their trucks.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Eric M. Weiss and Spencer S. Hsu. `` -Day Hazmat Ban Is Passed; Measure Will bar Shipments in DC.'' Washington Post, February , , p. B . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, safety standards should be enforced. For example, it should not be tolerated that half of the nation's , train cars frequently carrying poisonous gases are obsolete or otherwise in poor shape.\ \ This recommendation complements the first, since it is easier to improve safety on a smaller number of trains.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Walt Bogdanich and Christopher Drew, ``Deadly Leak Underscores Concerns About Rail Safety.'' New York Times, January , , p. . \ \ Sara Kehaulani Goo, ``Accidents Spur New Focus on Securing U.S. Raily System,'' Washington Post. Janaury , . The Food and Water Industries Other areas where not enough has been done to prevent attacks are the food industry and the country's water infrastructure. In regard to food, the case for doing more can be debated. There are no known cases of al-Qa'ida or affiliates attacking the food supply, but that hardly means that an organization that has already proved itself innovative will not attack it in the future. And certain types of attacks, such as a small amount of botulism toxin poured into a milk truck leaving a farm could literally cause tens if not hundreds of thousands of deaths.\ \ Thus, if simple and economical measures that bring other benefits beyond the counterterrorism domain can be identified, they should be seriously considered. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Rick Weiss, ``Report Warns of Threat to Milk Supply,'' Washington Post, June , , p. A . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As he left the Bush administration, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson said the worries ``every single night'' about large-scale food poisoning.\ \ But infrastructure for monitoring food supplies and quickly detecting any signs of contamination is insufficient. Some additional funding has been added for food safety investigators and laboratories to check for deliberate contamination. But no demands have been placed on the nation's , + food processing sites to improve site security. Some voluntary measures have been adopted by the industry--and FDA and USDA have preferred to keep them voluntary to avoid collecting data that could later be made available due to Freedom of Information Act requests. But these have been spotty.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Mike Allen, ``Rumsfeld to Remain at Pentagon; Thompson Quits at HHS, Warns of Vulnerabilities,'' Washington Post, December , , p. A . \ \ General Accounting Office, Food-Processing Security, GAO- - (February ), pp. -- . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Requiring sites such as food processing centers to carry terrorism insurance (against any liability for poisoning that occurs on their premises) may provide the simplest and soundest means of addressing this vulnerability in a cost-effective way. At a minimum, it could lead to more uniform adaptation of commonsense protective measures such as more systematic patrolling and monitoring of the perimeters of facilities. As suggested by the Democratic members of the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, each state or region should also have the ability to quickly test foods for a wide range of possible contaminants. This can allow spot checking of food under normal circumstances, and prompt efforts to contain the consequences of any attack should one occur. As for water, it is extremely difficult to contaminate large water systems because of the amount of material needed for lethal doses. That means that protecting drinking water reservoirs, for example, need not extend to the level of providing complete assurance that no person on foot is ever near a reservoir at any time. Protective systems that keep trucks away from such reservoirs, and monitor foot traffic well enough to ensure that substantial numbers of people are not able to gain entry to a reservoir, would generally suffice. And as for the chemical treatment facilities, these can be viewed largely as any other chemical plant--with risk, and appropriate security measures, determined by the nature of the chemicals in use. To the extent chlorine is employed, that implies a reasonably high level of protection, but nothing beyond the scale of what would be properly applied to many other facilities in the chemical industry.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Government Accountability Office, Homeland Security: Agency Plans, Implementation, and Challenges Regarding the National Strategy for Homeland Security, GAO- - (January ), pp. -- . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A second problem with water concerns the potential for attacks on dams to flood metropolitan areas and create conditions not unlike those produced by Hurricane Katrina--though this time without the warning. Risk assessments have been completed for the nation's major dams.\ \ The amount of high explosive needed to destroy most of them, together with improved site security near most, limit the likely danger associated with this type of terrorist scenario. But they do not eliminate the risk entirely by any means. At a minimum, this worry is further reason for the nation to digest fully the lessons of Katrina-- and figure out how to mount large-scale responses to such catastrophes within hours rather than days. This observation has implications for many agencies, including NORTHCOM. The military should not be the lead responder to the vast majority of natural disasters or terrorist strikes, in terms of leading any effort. But leaving aside such issues, as well as the question of whether posse comitatus should be modified, the U.S. armed forces have physical capacities rivaled by no other national institution and at a minimum need to be better prepared to organize and deploy them fast in future crises. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Claudia Copeland and Betsy Cody, ``Terrorism and Security Issues Facing the Water Infrastructure Sector,'' in Russell Howard, James Forest, and Joanne Moore, eds., Homeland Security and Terrorism (New York: McGraw Hill, ), p. . Energy Infrastructure It will not always be possible to know what infrastructure to protect and what not to protect--until after the fact. Take for example the Alyeska Pipeline in Alaska (or any other oil pipeline). It is possible to use a rifle to disrupt the flow of oil, and in fact that has happened before (though in an act closer to vandalism or hooliganism than terrorism). Pipelines are of course attacked in Colombia, Iraq, and elsewhere so this threat is hardly implausible. That said, taking steps to try to prevent such attacks would clearly be very difficult in some places, short of setting up dense security perimeters (or burying the pipelines). Moreover, attacks on oil pipelines would be unlikely to cause the loss of any human life. This is the type of threat that should be in a second or even third tier of importance.\ \ Some measures such as protecting choke points, ensuring capacity for quick shutdown of damaged pipes, and protecting the pumping stations (and key electronics) of pipeline systems are warranted, but comprehensive protection is not.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ See for example, Andrea R. Mihailescu, ``Alaska's Vulnerable Oil Pipeline,'' Jane's Terrorism and Security Monitor, September , . \ \ One area where it behooves the United States to establish improved vigilance is in the vulnerability of power, communications, transportation, and water infrastructure to electromagnetic pulse from a high-altitude nuclear detonation. Terrorists are unlikely to carry out such an attack, but a nation-state could, and the nature of the preparation against such an attack is akin to homeland security activities so worthy of brief mention here. Protecting all electronics from such an attack is impractical (and modern electronic systems, with their low power requirements and low voltage tolerances, are inherently more vulnerable to such attacks than were vacuum tubes). But the country's infrastructure should not be allowed to fail catastrophically after such an attack; the period of recovery could last many months, during which time the country would have function like a premodern society. Devising protections to key nodes of major infrastructure is estimated to cost about one to three percent of total system cost, if done when a system is first being built. But retrofitting protections onto existing equipment might be an order of magnitude more expensive, implying costs reaching well into the tens of billions of dollars. This suggests a two-track approach to protection, redressing glaring vulnerabilities where feasible in the short term (that is, hardening key electronics used by major infrastructure, or purchasing backup systems), while planning to gradually eliminate other vulnerabilities as infrastructure is modernized in the coming years. See Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack, Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack, Volume I: Executive Report ( ), available at www.iwar.org.uk/iwar/resources/ emp/ - emp.pdf, accessed February , ; and Testimony of Frank Gaffney before the House Committee on the Budget, U.S. Congress, February , . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To take another energy example, of greater concern given the potential loss of life involved in any attack, Boston is the only major city in the United States to have a liquid natural gas terminal nearby. (Explosions of such tankers could cause structural damage to buildings a third of a mile away and burn the skin of people a mile away.\ \ ) Tankers were not allowed to come into Boston harbor to service this terminal during the Democratic convention, suggesting that there is a real basis to worry about a possible attack. But has the danger really passed now that the convention is over? This question suggests that it would be prudent to move the terminal--if not immediately, then at least when a major renovation would be needed on the existing infrastructure.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Justin Blum, ``Report Assesses Risks of Attack on Tankers,'' Washington Post, December , , p. E . \ \ Associated Press, ``Collins Suicide Attack Warning,'' Lloyd's List, July , , p. . Skyscrapers, Major Buildings and Other Structures In the United States, most large buildings, famous public facilities, sports stadiums, concert halls, and shopping malls are open to the public--and thus to terrorists armed with explosives, chemicals, or biological pathogens. Most such structures lack the types of filters that could clean up contamination that gets inside. Few buildings have the types of air circulation systems that reduce the danger of such contamination in the first place. And few have common-sense protections against the kinds of car and truck bombs that al-Qa'ida continues to employ with frequency and effectiveness around the world even in the post- / era. The degree of appropriate protection depends clearly on the nature of the potential target. For the nation's skyscrapers, largest arenas and stadiums, large train stations and airports, and any other locations where many thousands of people gather in confined spaces, special efforts are required when practical. New buildings might even be built a certain distance back from streets (as is the case with many U.S. embassies today), tougher structural building codes employed, and parking garages kept physically separate from buildings. But these sorts of sweeping measures are clearly not practical for all cases.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ See Protecting the American Homeland, pp. -- . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Existing structures can be equipped with shatterproof glass in lower floors. Vehicles entering their parking garages can be searched and in some cases restricted in their movements. When air circulation systems are renovated, their intakes should be moved above street level and monitored. Reverse pressure air systems and good filters are among the other options. Again, insurance markets can help incentivize owners to adopt such measures.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ See Eric Lipton and James Glanz, ``New Rules Proposed to Help High-Rises Withstand Attacks,'' New York Times, March , , p. A ; Letter from Michael C. Janus, Battelle Corporation, December , , to Michael O'Hanlon; Ann Gerhart, ``Tom Ridge, on High Alert,'' Washington Post, November , , p. C ; and Statement of Arden Bement, Director, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Hearing before the Committee on Science, U.S. House of Representatives, Cong. sess. (March , ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONCLUSION The number of sites that might be targeted in the United States is daunting, and a rigorous means of protecting the country comprehensively is unaffordable (if even conceivable). But the United States has a more limited number of sites of particular interest--where thousands of individuals routinely congregate, where the economy has important choke points or centers of activity, where the symbolic and political effect of any attack could be hugely significant. Most such sites are in the private sector, which holds percent of the nation's infrastructure, though an important number are clearly public too. By focusing on this category of key locations (and establishing different tiers of necessary protection within that category), and by using insurance makrets and related mechanisms to give private owners incentives to adopt best practices at reasonable cost, the country's vulnerability to truly catastrophic terrorism can be substantially mitigated. Since / , we have moved towards this objective. But we have a great distance still to go. __________ [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] Appendixes ---------- [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] "

The committee met, pursuant to notice, at : a.m. in room SD- , Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Jeff Bingaman, chairman, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF BINGAMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO The Chairman. OK, why don't we go ahead with the hearing. During the past four Congresses, we have passed a requirement that utilities provide a specific percentage of their electricity from renewable resources, again and again. In the th and the th and the th Congresses, we passed such provision in the Senate, but the House would not accept it. In the th Congress, the House passed it, but we could not get a vote on it here in the Senate. My own view is, it's time that we finally pass this provision in both houses and include it in legislation that we send to the President. It is one of the President's highest priorities. The provision that the hearing is on today is a majority staff draft. It's similar, as to its mechanics, to the provisions that we have passed before, but it does have some significant differences. First, the requirement is raised from percent by to percent by . Second, the resources that can be used to comply with the requirement have expanded; up to one-quarter of the requirement can come from energy efficiency. We've also included a new hydro--included new hydropower at existing dams that currently do not have generation. The reasons to pass such provision are as compelling as ever. In my view, the renewable standard can reduce our dependence on fossil fuel sources, can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Another effect of this reduction is to cause a reduction in the price of the fossil fuels that are displaced. Such a standard diversifies our resource base, lessening the effect of supply disruptions on-- or shortages, creating greater economic stability. It reduces our dependence on foreign sources of energy and creates greater energy security. This standard would also spur the development of a national green energy economy, creating hundreds of thousands jobs, many of them in rural areas. Over the years, we've seen many economic analyses of the renewable standards that have been proposed. All of these analyses, that have been done by independent analysts, conclude that the cost of implementing the standard ranged from negligible to positive, with many showing significant reductions in the overall cost of energy to Americans. When you add the fact that we're going to do something to put a price on carbon emissions--and I hope we are able to do that, probably through a cap-and-trade system--you have to know that the cost of whatever we do to reduce carbon emissions will be greatly reduced by a significant spur to the renewable generation of electricity, such as in a renewable electricity standard. I think that the votes are present in the Senate to pass a renewable electricity standard. I think they're present in the House, as well. I think that we need to get on with figuring out the precise provisions of that legislation. I hope to work closely with Senator Murkowski and other members of the committee on this job. The witnesses here today can help us greatly in that process. I look forward to hearing their testimony. [The prepared statements of Senators Mark Udall and Burr follow:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Mark Udall, U.S. Senator From Colorado Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for holding today's hearing on this important topic. Establishing a national Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) is something that I've been working on my entire career in public service. In , as a Colorado state legislator, I introduced several bills designed to advance renewable energy, including a state renewable portfolio standard. While my bills were voted down in committee and never reached the full House floor, my work in the Colorado House laid the path for action. In , I traveled across Colorado with the state House Speaker, Republican Lola Spradley, campaigning for the nation's first statewide RES ballot measure. Colorado voters approved Amendment , which required % renewable energy production for the state by . The Colorado legislature has since increased this RES to % by . I continued this work at a national level after being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In , along with my cousin, then- Congressman and now-Senator Tom Udall, I introduced a bill to create a national RES. This bill became the basis for the RES amendment that passed the House in . This amendment would have created an RES of % by . An RES is important for so many reasons. As demand for energy continues to grow in this country, we need to make sure that we continue to have affordable and reliable supplies. And, most importantly, as we move to more competition in the delivery of electricity, we must make sure that the environment and consumers are protected. So it makes sense to put incentives in place to ensure that less polluting and environmentally friendly sources of energy can find their way into the marketplace. And that's what a renewable electricity standard, or RES, would help to do. But it's not just about doing the right thing for the environment. With almost all new electricity generation during the last decade fueled by natural gas, our domestic supply cannot sustain our needs. Iran, Russia, and Qatar together hold percent of the world's natural gas reserves. As demand for power continues to grow, we shouldn't be forced to rely on these unstable regions to sustain our economy, nor do we have to. The best way to decrease our vulnerability and dependence on foreign energy sources is to diversify our energy portfolio. Half of the States in our great Union have already figured this out and have made the commitment to producing a percentage of their electricity using renewable energy. But all of our States will benefit under a national standard, which will bring natural gas costs down nationwide, create new economies of scale in manufacturing and installation, and offer greater predictability to long-term investors. By reducing the cost of new clean technologies and making them more available, it will help restrain natural gas price increases by creating more competition for those fuels. An RES will spur economic development in the form of billions of dollars in new capital investment and in new property tax revenues for local communities, and millions of dollars in new lease payments to farmers and rural landowners. Just look at what has happened in Colorado. At the time the RES passed, Colorado had less than MW of solar power installed statewide. Last year, Colorado installed over MW, and there is over MW installed statewide today. My state is very much ahead of schedule to meet the % by requirement--half of the solar requirement for the full period has been met in the first four years. Not only has that meant cleaner energy for Coloradans, but also more jobs. A major wind turbine supplier, Vestas, identified our state RES as a determining factor in locating , jobs to Colorado for its manufacturing headquarters for wind turbines. Governor Bill Ritter's office has estimated that just the solar component of the RES has brought nearly , new solar jobs to Colorado. Some have argued that a national RES would burden some regions of the country at the expense of others. That is inaccurate--a national RES would create public benefits for all. The argument that the Southeast is disadvantaged by the RES--that the Southeast has no renewable resources--ignores the plain truth. In fact, the Southeast is one of the regions of the country that will see the most benefit from this proposal. According to Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, the technology that does best under a % RES is biomass. Already, megawatts of generation come from biomass in the Southeast, and much of the waste from pulp and paper mills is not being used to generate electricity. In summary, a national renewable electricity standard will reduce harmful air and water pollution, provide a sustainable, secure energy supply now, and will create new investment, income and jobs in communities all over the country. A national RES would be good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for our country. So I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the Chairman's draft, which would create a % RES by . Thank you. ______ Prepared Statement of Hon. Richard Burr, U.S. Senator From North Carolina Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski, thank you for having this hearing today. It is important that we examine the details of a national renewable portfolio standard. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the benefits and goals of a national RPS. North Carolina is the first and only southeastern state to implement a state RPS. While the southeast region lacks in renewable resources, North Carolina took a hard look at what the state could achieve and set goals accordingly. As with most programs, the devil is in the details. We must be sure to craft a policy that utilizes all resources that achieve the goal of reduced emissions. This includes ramping up energy efficiency measures and perhaps including nuclear and hydropower. Over half the states in this country already have a state RPS. We need to find a way to incorporate these state programs into a national RPS so that we do not unfairly penalize the good work of early adopting states. I look forward to working with the committee to draft legislation that meets the goals of a national RPS while taking into consideration regional differences. While I look forward to the testimony from the witnesses this morning, I am disappointed that we do not have an Administration witness to explain how an RPS would be implemented at the federal level. It is my hope that Chairman Bingaman will be able to schedule a second hearing on this issue so that we might be able to hear from the Administration. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before introducing our witnesses, let me call on Senator Murkowski for her statement. STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding the hearing today. I want to welcome some of our new members that have not joined us on the Republican side before today. Welcome to you all. This is the first in a series of hearings that the Energy Committee will conduct as we work to craft our third comprehensive energy bill. We recognize that we don't have any administration witnesses before us today. I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for agreeing to hold a second hearing, regarding the issue of the RPS, to provide the Department of Energy and perhaps FERC, the opportunity to can explain how this complicated program should be implemented if we do move forward. I would also like to hear from another panel of stakeholders at that time. I do know that this is an important issue for you, Mr. Chairman. You have been a champion on the national renewable portfolio standard. This was a new approach in the th Congress, when we first began considering renewable energy requirements for utilities. At that time, there was just a handful of States that had such programs. Today, we have got States, including the District of Columbia, who have fashioned their own renewable energy programs. States are in a better position, I believe, than Congress to determine what resources and what timetables work best for them. A one-size-fits-all national standard raises some serious concerns about regional disparities. We recognize that there are some parts of our Nation that are blessed with abundant renewable resources; others, particularly in the Southeast, lack the renewable resources, perhaps other than biomass, that would be needed to reach a -percent requirement. I think we need to ask ourselves what are we trying to achieve with this program? Is our aim simply to increase renewable energy production, or is the goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? If the latter is true, it would seem to me that additional noncarbon-emitting technologies should be included. Now, some point out that choosing specific technologies actually conflicts with the goals for a market- based carbon-reduction program such as cap-and-trade. I think that one issue that people have reached consensus is that the RPS, as drafted, is not a climate-change solution. I do not think that we can consider RPS in a vacuum. We know that our existing transmission network is inadequate to support our environmental goals. If the necessary transmission is not put in place--and that means dealing with the siting issues, the permitting, the cost allocation issues--if the necessary transmission isn't there, it is impossible to reach the new Federal mandate, and the customer will end up paying the cost of noncompliance. I think we all agree that we have to find ways to power our lives, that are cleaner, more efficient, and more environmentally protective. Certainly at this time we must do it in ways that help our economy. As we move forward, we must consider whether the RPS is the right policy at this time or whether perhaps it has been overtaken by the need to address climate change issues. If Congress chooses to impose the national standards, how can we make this work for all parts of the country? How do we handle the existing State programs that are already in place? How do we deal with the transmission impediments? What about the costs? I think, in this time of economic crisis, we can't be asking people to choose between something as basic as energy and putting food on the table. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to have the first of these hearings. I think we'll get some good discussion, put some real meat on the bones of the issue. I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses today and to working with you as we move forward. [The prepared statement of Senator Murkowski follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Lisa Murkowski, U.S. Senator From Alaska Mr. Chairman, thank you for convening this hearing today. This is the first in a series of hearings the Energy Committee will conduct as we work to craft the third comprehensive energy bill in as many Congresses. Because the Administration was unable to appear before us today, I'd like to thank Chairman Bingaman for agreeing to hold a second hearing on the RPS issue so the Department of Energy, and perhaps even FERC, can explain how this complicated program should be implemented, if enacted. I'd also like to hear from another panel of stakeholders at that time. I know this is an important issue for the Chairman, who has been a long-time champion of a national Renewable Portfolio Standard. This was a new approach when the th Congress first began considering a renewable energy requirement for utilities. At that time, only a handful of states had such programs. Today, states, plus the District of Columbia have fashioned their own renewable energy programs. States, of course, are in a far better position than Congress to determine what resources and timetables work best for them. A one-size- fits-all national standard raises serious concerns with about regional disparities. While some parts of our nation are blessed with abundant renewable resources others-particularly the Southeast-lack renewable resources other than biomass needed to reach a % requirement. I have a number of questions on the feasibility of the Southeast using biomass as the sole means to meet this requirement, including the land use needs, carbon emissions, and environmental impacts. We need to ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve with this program. Is our aim simply to increase renewable energy production? Or is the goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? If so, it would seem that additional non-carbon emitting technologies should be included. Some point out that choosing specific technologies actually conflicts with the goals for a market-based carbon reduction program, such as cap and trade. One thing people do agree on is that the RPS, as drafted, is not a climate change solution. Further, we cannot consider the RPS in a vacuum. We know that our existing transmission network is inadequate to support our environmental goals. If the necessary transmission is not put in place- and that means dealing with thorny siting, permitting and cost- allocation issues-it will be impossible to reach this new federal mandate and the customer will end up paying the cost of non-compliance. We all agree that we must find ways to power our lives that are cleaner, more efficient, and of course, environmentally protective. And now we must do so in a way that helps right our economy. So, as we go forward, we must consider whether the RPS is the right policy at this time or has it been overtaken by the need to address climate change issues? If Congress chooses to impose a national standard, how can we make this work for all parts of the country? How do we handle existing state programs? How do we deal with the transmission impediments? And what about the costs? In this economic crisis, we can't be asking people to choose between something as basic as energy and putting food on the table. I'd like to thank all of our witnesses for joining us today. I look forward to hearing your testimony and getting your thoughts on the issues I have outlined. Mr. Chairman, thank you again for convening this important hearing. The Chairman. Thank you very much. We have five excellent witnesses today. One of our witnesses is from New Jersey, and Senator Menendez had asked to make that introduction. Why don't you go ahead with that, and then I'll introduce the others. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, first of all, for holding this hearing, which I think is incredibly important, and for the privilege of introducing Dr. Ralph Izzo, who is the chairman of the board, the president, and the CEO of the Public Service Enterprise Group. I didn't know you had that many titles, Ralph, so--I didn't. PSEG is one of the Nation's ten largest energy companies in the Nation, and it's one of the most important subsidiaries as New Jersey's utility. As many on the committee may already know, New Jersey has an incredibly ambitious plan to reduce our carbon footprint, and perhaps the centerpiece of that plan is our State's renewable portfolio standard: . percent of New Jersey's electricity must come from renewable sources by . We also have a specific carve-out for solar energy which requires . percent of all electricity to come from solar. The success New Jersey has achieved thus far from renewable energy is just the tip of the iceberg, due, in large part, to Dr. Izzo's commitment to help New Jersey meet its environmental standards. Just today, his company announced that it is seeking approval for a new Solar All Program to bring megawatts of solar power directly to communities and customers throughout its service territory. That program will result in savings to municipal and county budgets, it will create hundreds of new jobs, and it will eliminate . million tons of CO emissions, which is the equivalent of removing nearly , cars from the road for year. So, I could go on about Dr. Izzo's other efforts, but I think you'll hear from him. His leadership and experience in New Jersey should serve as a model for the Nation. I think, Mr. Chairman, only if we have energy producers and electric utility companies working alongside policymakers can we ever hope to achieve our shared vision of the Nation thriving on the economic growth of green industries and a Nation free of-- independent of foreign energy sources. I really appreciate you having Dr. Izzo here today. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Let me just introduce our other four witnesses, and then we will hear from all of them before we ask questions. Next is Don Furman, who is with Iberdrola Renewables, in Portland, Oregon--we're very pleased to have you; Commissioner David Wright, representing SEARUC, from Columbia, South Carolina--thank you for being here; Scott Jones is here-- representing the Forest Landowners Association, in Atlanta; and Professor Lester Lave is here from Carnegie Mellon University, and has been very involved with the National Academies of Science, in their ongoing study, which we're looking for the results of very soon. Dr. Izzo, why don't you start. If each of you could take or minutes and tell us the main points you think we need to understand, and then we will have questions. STATEMENT OF RALPH IZZO, PRESIDENT, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP, INC., NEWARK, NJ Mr. Izzo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Murkowski, Senator Menendez, and members of the committee. As the Senator mentioned, our family of companies distributes electricity and natural gas to more than million customers in New Jersey, and we own and operate approximately , megawatts of electric generating capacity, primarily in the Northeast, but also in the Mid-Atlantic and Texas. I'm pleased to appear before you this morning to express my strong desire to see this Congress adopt a national renewable portfolio standard. I applaud you, Chairman Bingaman, for your leadership on this issue over many years, and I also recognize the leadership of my home-State Senator, Robert Menendez. Global warming, in my opinion, is the most important environmental challenge of our time. To avoid catastrophic impacts from climate change, most scientists are telling us that we must achieve carbon emission reductions of percent by . To reach this target, we urgently need decisive Federal action; not a patchwork of State and regional fixes, but a strong, progressive national energy policy. An RPS is an essential component of such an energy policy, because it creates the demand for technologies that will transform the way in which we generate electricity. As we electrify transportation, it'll be even more important that renewable electric generation will become fundamental to our energy security. Also with this policy, we will be creating jobs. We will develop new technologies that we can export all over the world. So, investment in renewable energy is a strategy for long-term growth. As an investor and as a businessman, I believe the adoption of a Federal RPS would create tremendous opportunities. PSEG, our company, is already beginning to invest heavily in alternative energy. Today, as was mentioned, our utility filed a proposal with New Jersey regulators to invest almost $ million in solar generation over the next years. This will include putting solar installations on brownfield sites, low-income housing, government buildings, and over , utility poles. But, we're not stopping there. We've also proposed, and are planning to develop, a -megawatt offshore wind farm, which would be located miles off the coast of southern New Jersey. We recently created a joint venture to develop compressed-air storage facilities that can store energy from renewables and help make them more competitive. ``Them,'' meaning the renewables. A Federal RPS will send clear market signals to companies like ours to increase our investment in renewable electric generation. In the long term, these investments will be a net benefit to customers. In the short term, however, renewable energy is more expensive than fossil-fuel generation. We must be up front with consumers about these additional costs. The most effective way to minimize costs, however, is through a national approach. A strong national program, such as the one being considered by this committee, will create economies of scale and drive down production costs. Once developers can rely upon a stable national market for renewable energy credits, it will reduce their risk and, therefore, reduce their cost of capital. It is also worth noting that certain emerging renewable technologies, such as offshore wind and solar, will need additional Federal incentives, particularly through the tax code. Fostering these industries is important to our long-term climate-change strategy. In closing, Mr. Chairman, as you know, our country faces daunting challenges. We must dramatically reduce carbon emissions and transform our energy economy. This, while we face rising unemployment and an unprecedented economic crisis. Implementing an RPS will send a clear signal to investors that a true shift has occurred in our approach to national energy policy. Let us encourage these types of sustainable investments to power our way out of this economic downturn. We need to get started now. Mr. Chairman, I ask that my full written testimony be entered into the record. Thank you, and I'd be pleased to answer any questions later. [The prepared statement of Mr. Izzo follows:] Prepared Statement of Ralph Izzo, President, Chairman and CEO, Public Service Enterprise Group, Inc., Newark, NJ Mr. Chairman, Senator Murkowski and Members of the Committee, my name is Ralph Izzo and I am President, Chairman and CEO of Public Service Enterprise Group. Our family of companies distributes electricity and natural gas to more than two million utility customers in New Jersey, and owns and operates approximately , megawatts of electric generating capacity concentrated in the Northeast, Mid- Atlantic and Texas. I am pleased to appear before you this morning to express my strong desire to see this Congress adopt a national Renewable Portfolio Standard. I applaud you, Chairman Bingaman, for your leadership on this issue over many years, and I also recognize the leadership of my home- state Senator Robert Menendez. I support a national RPS as a citizen who is deeply concerned about climate change; as an investor who sees exciting opportunities in the renewable sector; and as the head of a company concerned about its customers and their ability to pay for green investments, particularly in this economic environment. The reports of how our climate is already changing are increasingly alarming. Temperatures are rising, and the Arctic ice sheet and glaciers around the world are melting even faster than anticipated. Global warming is the most important environmental challenge of our time. To avoid catastrophic impacts from climate change, most scientists agree that we must achieve carbon emission reductions of % by . To reach this target, we urgently need decisive federal action--not a patchwork of state and regional fixes, but a strong, progressive national energy policy. PSEG has advocated a three-pronged approach to reduce carbon emissions. Conservation through energy efficiency improvements. Development of renewable energy resources. And an expansion of clean, zero-and low-carbon central station electric generation, such as nuclear power. Putting a price on carbon with a carbon cap-and-trade program is a crucial step toward achieving all three of these strategies. But we need a comprehensive package of policy solutions to achieve our goals. A federal RPS is an essential component of that package, targeted specifically at growing America's renewable energy industry. We cannot only focus on short-term, least-cost carbon reduction measures; we also need to create demand for technologies that will transform the way we generate electricity. And from an energy security perspective, it is crucial that we decarbonize our electric generation in tandem with efforts to electrify transportation. With America's skilled workforce and entrepreneurial spirit, we should be leading this charge. But today we are playing catch up with other nations in developing renewable energy industries. A key factor that gives those countries a competitive advantage is a clear, pro- renewable energy policy. With the right national policy, America can develop the world's leading clean energy industry. We will create jobs. And we will develop new technologies that we can export all over the world. Investment in renewable energy is a strategy for long-term growth. As an investor and businessman, I believe the adoption of a federal RPS would create tremendous opportunities. PSEG is already beginning to invest heavily in alternative energy. Today, our utility filed a proposal with New Jersey regulators to invest almost $ million in solar generation over the next five years. This will include putting solar generation on brownfields, low-income housing and government buildings. It also will include roughly , solar installations on top of our utility poles. This is in addition to the more than $ million our utility is already investing in solar generation. Our merchant renewable generating company is also developing solar, offshore wind and other alternative energy projects. Most notable among these is a joint venture with Deepwater Wind to build a megawatt wind generation facility roughly miles off the coast of South Jersey. This project will use a patented technology that allows us to locate wind farms in deep water, virtually out of sight from the shore. We also recently created a joint venture called Energy Storage and Power to develop compressed air storage facilities that can store energy. This technology can be paired with intermittent renewable generation resources to make them more reliable and competitive. Projects such as these are just the starting point of what America must build if we are going to combat climate change and grow a robust renewable energy industry. A national RPS will send clear market signals to companies like PSEG to increase their investment in renewable electric generation. Finally, as the head of a company with over two million customers, including the majority of New Jersey's low- and moderate-income families, I worry about customers' ability to pay for green investments. In the long term, these investments will be a net benefit to customers. In addition to reduced carbon emissions, benefits include job creation, economic development, cleaner air and greater energy security. Moreover, modeling by the Energy Information Administration has shown that the renewable generation spurred by a national RPS will likely displace older and less efficient fossil fuel plants, placing downward pressure on fossil fuel prices and the wholesale price of electricity. And over time, renewable technologies will become competitive with traditional sources of generation. In the short term, however, these investments generally increase customer costs because today electricity from renewable generation is more expensive than electricity from fossil fuel generation. We must be candid with our customers about these higher costs as we emphasize the important benefits. The most effective way to minimize costs is through a national approach. A federal program will create economies of scale, and it will reduce the cost of capital once developers can rely on a stable, national market for renewable energy credits, or RECs. I believe that by establishing a robust national RPS program, we will begin to move toward a single REC market as state policymakers eventually elect not to maintain separate regional renewable energy ``currencies.'' For example, New Jersey has an RPS that must be met with renewable energy generated within PJM, our regional electric grid. Energy from a wind farm in Illinois may count, but energy from a wind farm in Nebraska does not count, even though it may be a more affordable compliance option. Once a strong federal program is in place, state policymakers may decide that making that distinction no longer makes sense for their ratepayers. Of course, states will always be able to go above and beyond the federal standard and set a higher RPS target. And states will likely want to maintain targeted efforts to promote specific renewable industries in their state, as New Jersey is doing with solar and offshore wind. But with a strong national program, we will begin to see more stability and uniformity in the market place. Let me address a few more specifics in the latest draft RPS legislation. The target of percent by is consistent with the target set by New Jersey. It is aggressive but achievable, and the alternative compliance mechanism of cents per kilowatt hour provides reasonable assurance that costs will not spiral out of control ahead of technological breakthroughs. I also appreciate the effort to promote small distributed generation by awarding it triple federal credits. However, by defining distributed generation as being ``at a customer site,'' you may exclude certain types, such as the solar panels on utility poles that we are proposing to install. We think a small change in the definition could address this issue. As for the inclusion of energy efficiency as a compliance mechanism, I believe the RPS should be used exclusively to promote renewable energy. Investments in conservation and efficiency are crucial, as they are currently the most affordable way to reduce carbon emissions. But Congress should promote energy efficiency through separate initiatives rather than allowing investment in efficiency to displace investment in renewables. Given the steep decreases in carbon emissions that we must make over the next years, we need to pursue both efficiency and renewables at full speed. In addition, it is worth noting that certain emerging renewable technologies will need additional federal incentives, particularly through the tax code. A market driven approach like the RPS will appropriately drive investment toward what are currently the most cost- competitive forms of renewable generation. However, developing promising industries, like solar and offshore wind, is an important part of our long-term climate change solution. Finally, as I said earlier, the development of clean, central station power is a critical element to a coherent climate change policy. PSEG is a nuclear company, with over half of our generation output coming from our three nuclear units in South Jersey and a unit we partially own in Pennsylvania. Investment in new nuclear generation needs federal support. This should include fixing the loan guarantee program and supporting the manufacturing of key nuclear components. But I do not believe a federal RPS is the appropriate mechanism to provide incentives for new nuclear generation. In closing, Mr. Chairman, as you know, America faces daunting challenges. We must reduce carbon emissions % by . We must transform our energy economy and establish America as the world's leader in innovative and clean energy technologies. And as the Senate considers the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act this week, we face rising unemployment and an unprecedented economic crisis. We can begin to address all of these challenges by implementing a strong, national RPS program and sending a clear signal to investors that a true shift has occurred in our approach to national energy policy. Let us encourage sustainable investments to power our way out of this economic downturn. The time to act is now. The Chairman. Thank you very much. We will include everyone's full statement in the record. Mr. Furman, go right ahead. STATEMENT OF DONALD N. FURMAN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRANSMISSION, AND POLICY, IBERDROLA RENEWABLES, INC., PORTLAND, OR Mr. Furman. Mr. Chairman, Senator Murkowski, and the committee, thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you. I'm senior vice president of transmission development and policy for Iberdrola Renewables. We're a United States corporation headquartered in Portland, Oregon. We're the second largest developer and operator of wind farms in the United States. We're also actively developing solar and biomass facilities. In alone, we invested over $ billion just in wind-generating facilities in the United States. I'm here, obviously perhaps, to urge the support and the passage of a national RPS. There are three benefits that we see to a national RPS. Depending on what's playing in the papers on any point in time, one may surge to the front, in terms of being most important, but they're all solid reasons for doing it. The first one is economic. In , the wind industry in this country built , megawatts of wind--in excess of , megawatts--$ billion invested, , jobs. That is a good, positive thing that happened, and those effects lasted all the way through the end of and are continuing into . The RPS has been estimated to create, if passed in its current form as proposed, , new jobs, $ billion in new investment. This is all according to a study by the Union for Concerned Scientists. So, it's an economic stimulative package that involves investment, not just spending money on things that won't yield a return, but on long-term investment. The benefits are the next two reasons--the benefits of those investments. Equally important, in my view, is national security. If you look at the last to years in this country, we have built largely natural-gas-fired generation in order to meet our growing needs. Natural gas is a good way to generate electricity. It's flexible. There are many benefits to it. But, we have a limited supply. At some point, we will start to run out of domestic supplies. Guess who owns most of the world's natural gas? It's people who don't like us very much. So, this is, in my view, a national security imperative, that we find ways, and start planning for that time in the future when our domestic supplies start to wane and we do begin to seriously import liquified natural gas. I think it's essential to our way of life. Energy is such an important part of our economy, it is essential that we get ahead of that. The third obvious benefit is environmental. This is not the sole solution to global--to climate change and to carbon, but it is a major component to it, and there's no reason not to get started on it today. EIA estimates percent RPS would result in billion tons of carbon reduction. That's substantial. That is a substantial amount of carbon. UCS estimates that - percent RPS would be the equivalent of taking $ million-- million cars off the road. So, it is a substantial part of dealing with carbon. There are several arguments against the RPS; we've heard some of them already. One of them is that it's discriminatory, in terms of regions of the country. I don't think nothing could be further from the truth. The whole purpose of an RPS is to create a trading system that will allow you to trade renewable rights. The idea behind that is, essentially, to have a single price. Everybody will pay the same price. That's an important component. A lot has been made about wealth transfer, and I don't think that holds water at all. Second, higher prices. Perhaps, in the very short term. But, an RPS, as was pointed out by Dr. Izzo, will actually drive prices down as we achieve economies of scale. More importantly, particularly for the wind business, which is going to be where the bulk of the compliance comes from--wind is a logistically driven business. If you don't--if you have high transportation costs, if you're not manufacturing, domestically and locally, you're going to have high costs, and that's one of the reasons it's more expensive. An RPS will give companies the incentives to invest in manufacturing facilities, locally. The last argument is that it should be done by the States. I think it's clear that results in a Balkanized system. It's a compliance nightmare for utilities. It's very, very difficult. In terms of the current draft, I've included in my testimony a number of things that--including a number of maps that demonstrate that there is renewable energy across this country. There's substantial biomass in the Southeast, there is a lot of ability to comply at a reasonable level. The current draft--we've pointed out, in my written testimony, a number of things--I would call out energy efficiency, though, as an important thing that we think ought to be done first. Utilities ought to start with energy efficiency, but it ought not to be put in this bill, because it will create an accounting nightmare. I will conclude my remarks by noting that I testified before this committee in favor of an RPS years ago, and at that time I was employed by--it was a different part of my life, and I was employed by, actually, the largest coal-burning utility west of the Mississippi. The reasons I testified for the RPS then are the same reasons as I'm testifying now and that I urge its support. The difference is, the urgency is far greater. Thank you for this opportunity to speak, and I'd ask that my written comments be included in the record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity. [The prepared statement of Mr. Furman follows:] Prepared Statement of Donald N. Furman, Senior Vice President for Development, Transmission, and Policy, Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., Portland, OR Mr. Chairman, Senator Murkowski and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today and thank you for holding this important hearing. My name is Don Furman. I am Senior Vice President for Development, Transmission, and Policy for Iberdrola Renewables, Inc. Iberdrola Renewables is a U.S. corporation \ \, headquartered in Portland, Oregon. We are America's second-largest developer and operator of wind energy generating facilities. We also are engaged in the development and operation of solar and biomass generating facilities and other energy activities. In , alone, Iberdrola Renewables invested more than $ billion in energy projects located throughout the country. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Iberdrola Renewables in affiliate of Iberdrola Renovables--the world's largest wind power generator with operations in more than countries. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The purpose of my testimony is to urge the Congress to enact national renewable portfolio standard (RPS) legislation. Mr. Chairman, Iberdrola Renewables appreciates your leadership in promoting a national RPS over the years. We would not be close to enacting this legislation without your commitment and persistence. The time has arrived for the House and Senate to send to the President a robust RPS bill that will help expand the economy, protect the environment, reduce consumer energy costs and enhance our national security. President Obama's New Energy for America Plan calls for an RPS that ``ensures percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by , and percent by .'' While these targets might appear ambitious, they are certainly achievable. Last year, the Department of Energy issued a report concluding that, if certain barriers are eliminated, wind energy alone could provide up to percent of the nation's electricity supply by . Other renewable energy technologies including solar, biomass and geothermal also have the potential to produce substantial amounts of electricity in the near- term, if the proper policies are adopted. benefits of renewable energy deployment A national RPS, by increasing the deployment of renewable electric generation capacity, will produce enormous economic benefits. Until recently, renewable energy had been one of the few bright spots in the U.S. economy. In , more than , MW of wind power capacity (accounting for % of all new electric capacity additions) was installed in the United States. This activity created an additional $ billion in investment and , jobs throughout the economy \ \--and not just in states hosting wind farms. For example, at least three manufacturers have announced plans to build windmill blade and turbine manufacturing facilities in Arkansas--investing approximately $ million and adding more than , jobs to the State's economy. Enactment of a national RPS would be a significant boost for the economy. According to a analysis prepared by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a percent national RPS, by itself, would create , new jobs and generate approximately $ billion in new capital investment.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ ``Wind Generation Grows by Record , MW in '', American Wind Energy Association Press Release (January , ). \ \ ``Cashing In On Clean Energy'', Union of Concerned Scientists (July , ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- An increased reliance on renewable energy to power our homes and businesses would also substantially reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and other harmful pollutants. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) in concluded that a percent national RPS would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by billion tons.\ \ The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that a percent RPS would amount to the emissions reduction equivalent of removing . million cars from the road.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ ``Impact of a -Percent Renewable Portfolio Standard'', Energy Information Administration (June, ). \ \ ``Cashing In On Clean Energy'', Union of Concerned Scientists (July , ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The increased deployment of renewable energy will also enhance our national energy security. The electric generation sector in the U.S. has become dangerously reliant on natural gas. According to the EIA, natural gas-fired facilities are expected to account for approximately half of all electric generation capacity additions over the next four years.\ \ Although domestic natural gas production has risen, it is unlikely to maintain pace with demand. This will raise gas prices and increase our reliance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported from countries that aren't necessarily friendly with the United States. In fact, natural gas exporting countries from unstable parts of the world, including Russia and Iran, recently held discussions aimed at forming an OPEC-style cartel. Mr. Chairman, Americans can not afford to be subjected to another international energy cartel. Renewable energy can act as an important hedge--reducing overall gas demand and limiting our reliance on natural gas imports. According to a report prepared by Wood Mackenzie--a firm that does consulting work for the natural gas industry--a percent national RPS would reduce natural gas demand by three bcf per day and lower U.S. natural gas prices by more than percent.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ ``Planed Nameplate Capacity Additions from New Generators by Energy Source'', Energy Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov/ cneaf/electricity/epa/epat p .html). \ \ ``The Impact of a Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard'', Wood Mackenzie (February, ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- a national rps is urgently needed Today, the only significant incentives for renewable energy development are located in the tax code--the renewable production tax credit (PTC), the solar investment tax credit (ITC) and accelerated depreciation (MACRS). These tax incentives have been successful to a point. However, they have also led to a substantial amount of uncertainty that has, at times, inhibited investment in renewable generation and blocked the development of a domestic renewable energy manufacturing base. The PTC, which was first enacted in , has expired on three different occasions and has neared expiration several other times. When Congress has extended the PTC, the extensions have always been for short time horizons. Until recently, the ITC had suffered a similarly inconsistent history. This uncertainty has inhibited long term planning for renewable project developers. In addition, it has limited investment in a domestic manufacturing base. The vast majority of renewable energy equipment is still manufactured overseas, often using technology developed here. The ongoing congressional debate on the economic stimulus package over the relief necessary to enable renewable energy developers to use existing renewable energy tax incentives illustrates the urgent need for enactment of a national RPS. Because they operate very capital intensive businesses, most renewable energy developers do not have sufficient taxable incomes to directly utilize these tax incentives. As a result, they have been forced to enter into Internal Revenue Service- sanctioned ``tax equity partnerships'' with companies that had large amounts of taxable income--primarily very large financial institutions. These arrangements were grossly inefficient--Wall Street intermediaries ended up with up to percent of the value of the renewable energy tax incentives, at the expense of renewable energy projects and consumers. The recent collapse of a large number of financial service companies has virtually eliminated even that avenue for renewable energy developers to utilize the PTC, ITC and MACRS. Unless action is taken by Congress soon, investment in new renewable energy capacity in and is expected to decline dramatically--costing upwards of , jobs. The renewable energy industry is hopeful that the economic stimulus bill will provide some temporary relief to enable renewable energy developers to monetize renewable energy tax incentives. This, of course, begs the question: why are we using an inefficient tax policy to accomplish a goal that is critical to our security and of strategic important to our future as a nation? A national RPS will provide a simple, direct signal to the market place that will drive renewable energy development and eventually obviate the need for the PTC. By establishing a market for renewable energy over a reasonable period, a national RPS would provide the long-term certainty that is essential for developing a vibrant domestic renewable energy industry. opponents' arguments are unconvincing Mr. Chairman, we are encouraged that the concept of a national RPS is growing in popularity, even among electric utilities. On January , nine publicly-owned and investor-owned utilities (representing diverse regions and generation sources) were among a group of companies that signed a letter to President Obama's Chief of Staff urging the enactment of national RPS. There remain, however, a number of opponents that continue to make the same tired, old arguments, no matter how many times they are refuted. These arguments are pure sophistry. First, critics argue that a national RPS will discriminate against states that don't have substantial wind power resources. However, this ignores the fact that a variety of renewable technologies would be eligible for RPS compliance. As the attached maps demonstrate, each region of the country is blessed with substantial amounts of renewable resources. For years, opponents of a national RPS have mockingly referred to it as a ``wind portfolio standard''. However, the EIA, in analyzing previous national RPS proposals considered in the House and Senate, has consistently concluded that biomass energy, not wind, would benefit the most and that solar power would also receive a substantial amount of renewable energy credits.\ \ EIA has also concluded that utilities in the Southeastern U.S.--a region with limited wind power potential--would have access to a substantial amount of renewable energy in order to comply with a national RPS. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ See e.g., ``Impacts of a -Percent Renewable Portfolio Standard'', Energy Information Administration (June, ); ``Energy and Economic Impacts of Implementing Both a -Percent Renewable Portfolio Standard and a -Percent Renewable Fuel Standard by '', Energy Information Administration (August, ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Utilities could also economically comply with a national RPS through renewable energy generated in other states. For instance, a proposed transmission expansion plan by the Southwest Power Pool is expected to bring the Southeast significant wind power resources from the central plains. Moreover, by establishing a national renewable energy credit (REC) trading market and enabling utilities to comply through the acquisition of RECs, a national RPS will ensure that the most cost effective renewable energy facilities will be deployed. Many of the naysayers that argue that a statute causing a utility to purchase renewable energy or RECs associated with renewable energy generated elsewhere somehow would amount to a regional wealth transfer, are the same utilities that currently import large amounts of coal and uranium mined thousands of miles away. The fact is that our nation has always been heavily dependent on interregional transfers of energy to ensure reliability and benefit consumers. Second, opponents claim that a national RPS will dramatically raise energy prices. However, the facts don't bear that out. According to Wood Mackenzie, a percent national RPS, because it significantly reduces the demand for natural gas and thus the price of electricity generated with gas, would cause electricity costs to decline by approximately $ billion over years.\ \ Further, EIA's analysis of a percent national RPS proposal considered in the previous Congress concluded that overall it would cause consumer energy costs to rise by less than one-half of one percent over a year period.\ \ Now that EIA is forecasting higher natural gas prices over the long term, an updated analysis will likely demonstrate greater savings. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ ``The Impact of a Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard'', Wood MacKenzie (February, ). \ \ ``Impact of a -Percent Renewable Portfolio Standard'', Energy Information Administration (June, ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third, some suggest that RPS programs are better left for the states to consider and administer individually. Twenty seven states have adopted their own renewable portfolio standard programs. These state programs have helped create markets for renewable energy. However, the state programs have their limitations. Some state RPS programs are better designed than others. It is not yet clear whether some of these state programs will actually cause much additional renewable generation to be built. In addition, certain states have erected barriers to renewable energy generated in other states, eliminating the efficiencies that come from interstate trading of renewable energy and the development of a national REC market. Moreover, certain states are unlikely to promote the development of a significant amount of renewable energy. A national RPS (supplemented by state programs that exceed the national floor) is the only policy that can ensure the development of significant amounts of renewable energy in the most cost effective manner. Finally, certain opponents argue that Congress should focus instead on the adoption of a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade regime because a national RPS would not do enough to prevent climate change. While it is true that the RPS would not obviate the need for greenhouse gas regulation, the fact is that it will likely take some time before a greenhouse gas regulatory scheme actually causes a significant shift in the electric generation resource mix. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are the only available mechanisms for reducing emissions in the near-term. In addition, as I have already noted, a national RPS produces other benefits (both economic and security-related) beyond the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. comments on draft rps proposal Mr. Chairman, I would like to take a moment to comment on the draft national RPS legislation you recently circulated. This legislation would help promote a vibrant domestic renewable energy industry and we urge the Committee to favorably report the bill, with some modifications. First, it is important that a national RPS bill contain compliance requirements that are achievable, yet ambitious enough to lead to greater investments in renewable energy. The draft legislation requires utilities regulated under the provision to meet an RPS target that begins at percent in and ramps-up to percent by and remains at percent through . On their own, these targets may appear to be reasonable. However, the legislation includes a number of provisions that would have the effect of reducing overall renewable generation levels. For instance, utilities with retail sales of less than million megawatt-hours would be exempted. In addition, utilities would deduct sales of hydropower and power generated from municipal solid waste before calculating the level of renewable energy required to comply with the Act. Moreover, in some cases utilities will be able to use energy efficiency to meet up to percent of their renewable energy requirement. Finally, distributed generation facilities that utilize renewable resources and renewable generation located on tribal land would be eligible for credit multipliers. Although these provisions may be necessary to meet other public policy objectives, they could significantly reduce the overall renewable energy target. We urge that the RPS compliance targets be strengthened to account for these exceptions. The draft RPS legislation would permit utilities, if their governors so petition, to use energy efficiency credits to comply with up to percent of their RPS obligations. Energy efficiency should always be the first resource option for every utility and efficiency certainly should be encouraged as much as possible. However, issuing energy efficiency credits for ``qualified energy savings'' and permitting those credits to be utilized for RPS compliance could be problematic. It is very simple to determine when a kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity is generated. It is far more complicated to determine when an action leads to an actual reduction of energy use and how much energy savings are actually achieved directly as a result of that action. For instance, the energy efficiency provisions of the draft RPS bill arguably would provide a factory owner with efficiency credits if the owner shuts down a factory due to the economic downturn. We believe that Congress should seek to encourage and require energy efficiency actions outside of the context of RPS legislation. We also believe that the funds received by the government would be better used if they were allocated back to utilities in the proportion those utilities submitted Federal Renewable Energy Credits in compliance with the bill. Such a provision, which is included in the Markey-Platts RPS bill that was recently introduced in the House, would further encourage utility compliance with the RPS through the generation of renewable energy and the acquisition of RECs rather than by making an alternative compliance payment. This concept is similar to an approach utilized in Great Britain's RPS program. Mr. Chairman, I want to briefly address a separate, but related, subject--electric transmission. Many sites with good wind, solar and geothermal resources are located great distances from load centers. Many of these sites aren't being developed because of insufficient transmission capacity to enable the power to be transported to consumers. Congress, by enacting, a national RPS, will help incent utilities to build additional amounts of transmission to allow them to access the most cost effective sources of renewable energy. However, more needs to be done. The current patchwork of regulatory responsibility over the planning and siting of transmission facilities and the allocation of the costs associated with those facilities has proven ineffective. We urge this Committee to also enact legislation that would provide a greater role for the Federal government to address the current regulatory impediments to the development of much needed interstate transmission designed to access renewable energy. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared presentation. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Mr. Wright--Commissioner Wright, go right ahead. STATEMENT OF DAVID A. WRIGHT, CHAIRMAN, SOUTHEASTERN ASSOCIATION OF REGULATORY UTILITY COMMISSIONERS, COLUMBIA, SC Mr. Wright. Thank you. My name is David Wright, and I'm a commissioner with the South Carolina Public Service Commission. Before I start, I'd like to thank the committee and thank the staff, both Jean and Kelly, for the job they did in assisting us, getting us ready on such short notice. So, thank you, and please pass that along to them. As regulators in the SEARUC region, we are responsible for ensuring that retail electricity customers receive safe, reasonably priced, reliable electric service. We believe establishing a uniform national renewable portfolio standard without regard to crucial regional differences will drive up electricity costs unnecessarily, jeopardize reliability, and divert capital needed to achieve aggressive carbon targets. Federal policy should give States the flexibility to promote renewable energy in a way that doesn't undercut the higher priority of reducing carbon emissions cost-effectively. South Carolina, for example, does not possess a wealth of renewable energy sources, such as the abundant solar energy that is available to States in the desert Southwest, the wind- turbine generation available to States located in the Great Plains, or hydro generation in the Pacific Northwest. As a result, my State and our region must seek to encourage the growth of research and development in the use of renewable sources that are available and economically viable to provide for our future needs. During many of the earlier years covered in the discussion draft RPS, we still have to continue our reliance on conventional base-load-generation sources, including new nuclear energy, to ensure that reliable, reasonably priced electricity is available to all of our citizens. As for solar power--with the current technology, solar has a low capacity factor, takes significant space, and is not always available during times of greatest need. In my State, we've had testimony that as much as percent of any wind or solar power would have to be backed up with conventional generation sources. Electricity consumers want power even when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. Because the availability and cost-effectiveness of traditional renewable energy sources vary so widely among States and regions, the SEARUC States believe that decisions regarding renewable energy portfolios should be left to the States. While we do urge Congress to support renewables, if you should decide to adopt an RPS mandate, we also ask that you carefully craft it to be practically achievable on a State-by- State basis. An RPS should be based on what a State can possibly achieve if it employs its best efforts to promote renewable generation. Some States are truly blessed with renewable resources, others are not. As the SEARUC region, we wish to emphasize that the aim of Federal energy legislation should not be to transfer wealth from one region of our Nation to another through the enforced purchase of renewable energy credits, or RECs. A very large concern for the SEARUC region is that the money used to purchase the RECs and alternate compliance payments will leave our States and our region, the very areas that need the money most. A one-size-fits-all Federal RPS would hit consumers hard in the Southeast, the region with the least renewable resources and the greatest poverty. Electricity customers would have to pay an expensive premium on top of higher costs that will come with meeting carbon targets. For instance, in my State we have one of the lowest income levels in the U.S., and one of the highest unemployment levels, and many of them live in mobile homes and other energy-inefficient housing. These low-income households are truly unable to participate in any energy efficiency and conservation efforts, which greatly limit our ability to achieve the proposed RPS or conservation goals. Because they live in energy-inefficient housing, their consumption rate of electricity is higher, and, naturally, so is their bill for electricity. A sad fact is, the only time they conserve is when they're forced to, when their power is shut off for inability to pay the bill. This is an important reason why we believe the money in the utility--i.e., the ratepayer--pays for RECs, and alternate compliance payments should not leave the State. The money should be reinvested in the State where it was paid, to develop and implement energy efficiency programs, to help low-income households, and to help make these renewable technologies more affordable. The energy policy report recently prepared and released by our public utilities review committee concluded that renewable resources would provide about percent of South Carolina's generation by . That would leave us--if you assume that we could get percent from conservation and efficiency, it would leave us percent short of the proposed -percent RPS by . Others in our region will face the same fate. North Carolina is the only State in the SEARUC region that has adopted and is operating under an RPS, a -and-a-half- percent RPS by , with percent of that total being allowed to come from energy efficiency. Regulators there have told me that if the national RPS were adopted as it is proposed in this discussion draft, the-cent kilowatt-hour alternate compliance payment alone would more than double the current cost to their customers. I was taught that you should not criticize something unless you are prepared to offer an alternative solution. With that in mind, I would ask that you and the Congress strongly consider doing exactly what was done in the Energy Policy Act of , when you charged public utility commissions across this Nation with setting standards for net metering and smart metering. Before moving forward with a national renewable portfolio standard, first give States a chance by charging those State public utility commissions across this Nation who do not have a renewable portfolio standard in place with creating such a standard. Like EPAct legislation, give commissions a deadline to get it done and in place. I know your goal is not to penalize anyone. Please move slowly on this issue and consider my suggestion to allow States to adopt and address their standards. Thank you for your time today, and it's truly an honor to be here. [The prepared statement of Mr. Wright follows:] Prepared Statement of David A. Wright, Chairman, Southeastern, Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, Columbia, SC Good Morning. I am honored to have the opportunity to appear before this distinguished Committee today to present testimony before you as you wrestle with this difficult issue. My name is David Wright. I am a legislatively elected Commissioner of the South Carolina Public Service Commission. I am here today as Chairman of the ten member states that comprise the Southeastern Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (SEARUC), a regional association of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC). I am also representing my state commission and myself as a South Carolina Commissioner. As regulators, my fellow commissioners and I in the SEARUC region are responsible for ensuring that retail electricity customers receive safe, reasonably priced, reliable electric service. We are concerned that a uniform, federal Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) mandate fails to recognize that there are significant differences among the states in terms of available and cost-effective renewable energy resources, and that having such a standard in energy legislation will ultimately increase consumers' electricity bills. Establishing a uniform national RPS, without regard to crucial regional differences, unnecessarily drives up electricity costs, jeopardizes reliability, and diverts capital needed to achieve aggressive carbon targets. If we are going to have renewable portfolio standards, they should be politically sustainable, and take into account what best efforts can achieve in each state, given its potential for renewable energy. Federal policy should give states the flexibility to promote renewable energy in a way that doesn't undercut the higher priority of reducing carbon emissions cost-effectively. Some regions of the country have unique renewable energy sources, like geothermal. Not all states are fortunate enough to have abundant traditional renewable energy resources, such as wind, or have them located close enough to the load center to render them cost-effective. The Southeast and large parts of the Midwest certainly face this circumstance. In particular, my state, South Carolina, does not possess a wealth of renewable energy sources, such as the abundant solar energy that is available to states in the Desert Southwest, the wind turbine generation available to states located in the Great Plains, or the hydro generation in the Pacific Northwest. As a result, my state, and our region, must seek to encourage the growth of research and development in the use of renewable resources that are available and economically viable to provide for our future needs. During the earlier years covered in the discussion draft being considered we will also have to continue our reliance on conventional base load generation sources including new nuclear energy to ensure that reliable, reasonably priced, electricity is available to all of our citizens. Even in regions of the country that do have access to wind energy, there frequently is stiff local opposition to building huge wind turbines, significant costs for the additional transmission needed, and reliability concerns. As a result, some renewable wind energy projects do not get built, while others take years to build. As for solar power, with the current technology, it has a low capacity factor, takes significant space, and is not always available during times of greatest need. In my state, we have had testimony that as much as % of any wind or solar power would have to be backed up with conventional generation sources. Electricity consumers want power even when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. Because the availability and cost-effectiveness of traditional renewable energy resources varies so widely among states and regions, the SEARUC states believe that decisions regarding renewable energy portfolios should be left to the states. Renewable energy is touted as a way to achieve energy independence, reduce green house gas emissions and reduce our carbon footprint. All of these are admirable goals. But what is it that the country really needs? Is it energy independence? Is it a reduced carbon footprint? Is it greenhouse gas- free energy? Like many, I believe it makes sense to do the best we can to achieve all of the above. But at what price? Additionally, to remove political influences, or the artificial `feel-good' nature a RPS might bring, you should consider relying on sound science as you craft a policy. By this I mean, the claims of trade groups or others who are promoting specific renewable technologies should be proven by sound scientific principles, using independent scientific methodology in a transparent way. The claims should be able to proven and reproducible others. After so many years of not having a real national energy policy, we're now in great danger of establishing a national policy that is doomed to failure--with a renewables policy and climate policy at cross-purposes. Consumers and our economy will pay a heavy price for the unintended consequences. While we agree with the overall goals as stated above, and urge Congress to support renewables, we also ask that you carefully craft any RPS mandate to be practically achievable on a state-by-state basis. Because of the differences in availability of renewable resources, some states' ``best efforts'' in developing renewables may produce results much lower than those that are practically achievable in other states. As the SEARUC region, we wish to emphasize that the aim of federal energy legislation should not be to transfer wealth from one region of our nation to another through the enforced purchase of Renewable Energy Credits, or RECs. Quite honestly, the utilities in my region will not be able to meet the renewable portfolio standard as set forth in this legislation. Instead, in order to achieve compliance, they will be forced to write very large checks for the RECs, money that will come from our ratepayers, and the money will leave our region where it is needed most. This will be a very significant dollar amount, too. As attachments to my testimony, I have included sources, links, memos, articles and letters from states in the SEARUC region to support my testimony.* Public Utility Commissions and Commissioners throughout the SEARUC region all tell me the same thing. While all of our states strongly support renewable and alternative energy generation, we do not support a federally mandated one-size-fits-all Renewable Portfolio Standard. As regulators and public officials, our statutory charge is to ensure safe, reasonably priced, and reliable electric service. We are concerned that a federally mandated RPS that fails to account for differences in regional and local characteristics could increase the cost of service for all consumers and businesses who use and pay for electricity and could reduce reliability, while providing no incentive for investment in our states or benefit to the customers in return for those higher bills. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * The following documents listed have been retained in committee files: Ryan H.

It is my hope that the Congress will recognize that there are truly significant differences in the availability of renewable resources from state to state. Some states are truly blessed. Others are not. I was brought up to believe that you should not criticize or complain about something unless you were prepared to offer an alternative or a solution. With that in mind, I would ask you that you and the Congress strongly consider doing exactly what was done in the Energy Policy Act of , when you charged public utility commissions across this nation with setting standards for net metering and smart metering within a set period of time. I would ask that, before you move forward with a national Renewable Portfolio Standard, you first give the states a chance by charging those state public utility commissions across this nation that do not already have a Renewable Portfolio Standard in place with creating such a standard. And, like in the EPACT legislation, give our state commissions a certain period of time to get it done and in place. Each state's RPS should recognize its renewable resource potential and should push for a best-achievable RPS within a given period of time. If a utility fails to meet the state standard, a penalty or compliance payment would have to be made to the state. That money would stay in the state where it would be invested in renewable technology or to developing and implementing energy efficiency programs for low-income households living in mobile homes or other energy-inefficient housing. Any utility that meets a state standard would be deemed to be in compliance with any federal requirement. North Carolina is the only state in the SEARUC region that has adopted, and is operating under, a renewable portfolio standard. After many studies and hearings on the subject, North Carolina adopted a . % RPS by with percent of that total being allowed to come from energy efficiency. But, North Carolina also adopted a cost cap. Regulators there have told me that if the national RPS were adopted as it is proposed in the discussion draft being considered today, the $ . cents/kwh alternate compliance payment alone would more than double the current cost to their customers. Florida is another state that is working through and toward a renewable energy policy. The Florida Public Utilities Commission is currently studying the issues and is consulting with the state legislature. A very large concern for my state and the SEARUC region is that the money used to purchase the REC's and alternate compliance payments will leave our states and our region, the very areas that need the money the most. Let me explain why I say that. A `one-size-fits-all' federal RPS would hit consumers hard in the Southeast, the region with the least renewable resources and the greatest poverty. Electricity customers would have to pay an expensive premium on top of the higher costs that will come with meeting carbon targets. South Carolina has one of the lowest income levels in the United States and one of the highest unemployment levels. Our workers' average annual salary is $ , , compared to a national average of $ , . There are a significant number of households living at the poverty level and below in South Carolina, as in much of the Southeast, and many of them live in mobile homes or other energy-inefficient housing. These people are proud, but they are poor. Literacy levels are low in South Carolina, and pose a significant obstacle to our meeting the energy efficiency component of an RPS. Statistics indicate that South Carolina has high student dropout rates and the majority of residents have some degree of illiteracy. South Carolina has the th highest percentage of adults at Level I or in the country. More than half ( %) of our state's residents fall within severe (Level ) to moderate (Level ) ranges of illiteracy (level is the lowest literacy level. Adults in this category can perform simple tasks with text and documents, but display difficulty using certain reading, writing, and computational skills considered necessary for functioning in everyday life. Adults at literacy level can begin to compare and contrast but are unable to perform higher level reading and problem solving skills.) If people cannot read or write, they will have a difficult time comprehending information about energy efficiency and conservation. These low-income households are truly unable to participate in any energy efficiency and conservation efforts, which greatly limits our ability to achieve the proposed RPS or conservation goals. But these people still must heat their homes. Because they live in energy- inefficient housing, their consumption rate of electricity is higher and, naturally, so is their bill for electricity, compared to the figures for occupants of more well insulated energy efficient homes. A sad fact is, the only time they `conserve' is when they are forced to: when their power is shut off for inability to pay their bill. South Carolina ranks th among in the country in median income, and th in disposable income. Many of our citizens simply can't afford weather stripping for the front door, much less energy-efficient windows or an energy-efficient heating unit. They may want to conserve, to make their homes energy efficient, to buy that Energy Star refrigerator, but they can't. They have to settle for that $ used refrigerator, if they can afford it, or have to decide how to pay their power bill and buy groceries for the family. This is not an exaggeration. A better way would be to provide incentives for the use of, or integration of, renewable technologies into a company's existing portfolio, instead of penalizing them, and ratepayers, for a failure to meet an arbitrary standard.The money a utility (i.e. the ratepayer) pays for REC's and alternate compliance payments should not leave the state. The money should be re-invested in the state where it was paid to develop and implement energy efficiency programs to help low-income households, and to help make these renewable technologies more affordable. In the proposed national RPS, development of sources of renewable energy would have to cost less than $ . cents/kWh to avoid paying the alternate compliance payment or it would be wasted money, meaning it would be cheaper to make the alternate compliance payment than to develop renewables and energy efficiency technologies. In a recent hearing before the South Carolina Public Service Commission, an witness testified that `` . . . PV solar's cost of energy ranges from cents per kWh to over cents per kWh.'' Wind resources in the South Carolina and the Southeast that may be suitable for wind generation are primarily located along the coast which is subject to hurricanes. No offshore wind turbines currently exist in the United States. A proposed offshore wind farm in Delaware recently bid to supply generation to Delmarva Power & Light for about - cent per kWh. I do not know whether this is a busbar cost or a delivered cost. However, I do know that it is above the current average residential retail rate for electricity in South Carolina which is about cents per kWh. The Energy Policy Report recently prepared and released by the Public Utilities Review Committee concluded that renewable resources would provide about % of South Carolina's generation by . Assuming that South Carolina could achieve the % conservation and efficiency limit and % of electric generation from renewable by , the utilities in South Carolina would fall % short of the proposed % RPS in . Based on the total South Carolina generation reported by the Energy Information Agency and the proposed cents per kWh Alternative Compliance Payment, South Carolina ratepayers would be subject to an annual Alternative Compliance Payment of more than $ million. This amount is in addition to the added cost of generation from renewable resources compared to the cost of generation from conventional resources. It is also possible that a civil penalty of cents per kWh could be assessed on all or part of the % shortfall in meeting the proposed RPS. From my view as a state regulatory commissioner, there are other issues or possible unintended consequences to consider as well. If I am to balance the needs of the utility against the needs of the ratepayer, where is the regulatory tipping point? As a regulator, how am I to treat a utility, and protect the ratepayer, in a rate proceeding when they have had to spend money to try and meet an RPS, and had to spend additional money to pay a penalty for not being able to meet the RPS, when what they really need is serious baseload generation to meet customer demand for electricity and a nuclear reactor is the least-cost generation source for them to meet the demand? An arbitrary national Renewable Portfolio Standard will hamper me as a regulator in being able to do the job I am charged to do. And I say that even before mentioning anything about the economic impact possible climate legislation or carbon legislation will have on ratepayers. As elected representatives of your states' citizens, you carry a heavy burden. But, your constituents trust you to do the right thing. I have followed some of your careers very closely and I have the honor of knowing some of you personally. I know your goal is not to penalize anyone. Please move slowly on this issue. In the meantime, also consider my suggestion to require the state utility commissions to address and adopt a renewable portfolio standard before you do something that may have serious unintended consequences. Senators, thank you for your time today. It is truly an honor to be here. I look forward to answering any questions that you may have, either today or, should you prefer, in writing to the Committee in the coming weeks. The Chairman. Thank you for your comments. Mr. Jones, go right ahead. STATEMENT OF SCOTT P. JONES, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, FOREST LANDOWNERS ASSOCIATION, ATLANTA, GA Mr. Jones. Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Murkowski, members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you and speak about the implications of a renewable electricity standard for America's family forest owners. Today, I will talk with you about family forest owners and the practicalities they face in trying to hold forestlands as forests. Specifically, will family forest owners sell wood, or will they sell real estate? Without forestland, there can be no forest resources, such as clean water, clean air, wildlife habitat, and wood-based commodities. I am Scott Jones. I'm a private forest landowner and executive vice president of the Forest Landowners Association. Today, percent of the commercial forestland in the United States is owned by almost million private forest landowners, and we are under increasing pressure to convert forestland to other uses. Family forest owners need new markets for wood, and you can help by creating renewable energy opportunities for America. Woody biomass must include all wood crops, in all forms and sizes. The use of woody biomass as a renewable energy source will provide needed markets for private forest landowners and contribute to forest health by creating economic incentives to deter conversion of forestland to other uses. In a mosaic of energy sources across the U.S., we seek a level playing field for wood, but we are concerned that forestland may be disproportionally burdened by well-meaning, but functionally stifling, regulation relative to other renewable energy sources. Wood is a reliable feedstock without the seasonal fluctuations or serendipity of weather that inhibits some other energy sources, and the resource is available now. In January , the New York Times headline read, ``Timber Famine Near, Says President Roosevelt.'' The article said that, ``This country is in peril of timber famine.'' Unless the forest can be made ready to meet the vast demands which growth will inevitably bring, commercial disaster is inevitable. Remember, at this time, pulpwood was nonexistent, since Charles Herty had not yet invented the pulping process. Only when we planted trees and encouraged markets did we end our brush with a timber famine. The point here is, markets cured the timber famine. Forest management for commodities did that. New markets did not create sustainability problems, they cured them. You may have heard that adding a new RES market to existing markets will create an unsustainable resource. This is simply not true. We do not have enough markets for the wood that we are growing. Forest Service data shows percent volume grown over removal in our country. The reduction in the forest products manufacturing not only affects the amount of wood grown, but is a threat to the perpetuation of forest landowners. Traditional markets for forest commodities are moving offshore. As fewer and fewer pulp and paper mills remain in this country, production has remained unchanged or slightly improved, but geographic distribution and access to these markets have degenerated. A few numbers to show the degeneration of the markets: pulp and paper mills were closed between and , and none have been built since ; softwood saw mills closed in the U.S. and Canada, to --and I know some in your districts have seen some recent closures; furniture plants closed between and . The incentive for forest landowners to convert forestland investments to residential and commercial real estate are led by population growth of nearly percent by , according to the United States Census Bureau. Projections by the Forest Service are that million acres of forestland will be developed to other uses between and in the Southeast. Again, I'm distinguishing between sustainable forestland, sustainable forest resources, and note that, without the land, there can be no resources. In legislation and regulation, if we are truly to meet a-- renewable energy goals, wood must be allowed to make its full contribution. Currently, percent of our Nation's forestland is natural. However, with the current definition of ``renewable biomass'' in the renewable fuel standards at its most restrictive, America's natural private forestlands are excluded. That's percent of our forestlands excluded from the renewable fuel standard. This kind of policy creates disincentives to continue to hold and manage forestlands. Federal forest policy must address the conundrum of what will motivate a forest landowner to continue to hold their investment. No definition that harms capital investment in energy facilities or takes the siting of these facilities can benefit the future of America's forestlands. Without broad, inclusive definitions for ``woody biomass,'' we're only encouraging the loss of private forestlands to other uses that are typically not as environmentally friendly. In conclusion, we believe we can help construct an approach that addresses concerns about environmental sideboards without--appropriately relying on existing practices and capabilities. However, the inclusion of a shadow Federal forest practice act is not the purpose of a renewable portfolio standard, or any energy bill. America's forest landowners already operate under, and comply with, some of the most strenuous environmental laws and regulations on the globe. With inclusive language for wood in the renewable electricity standard is the place--is in place, the Forest Landowners Association will use our resources, including our grassroots networks, to promote legislation that fairly includes the use of wood biomass to meet our Nation's energy needs. In fact, we've already begun working with land-based allies and the environmentalist community in an effort to address any forest health pressures that may arise from new energy wood markets. I thank the chairman, ranking member, and the members of the committee for the opportunity to have made these comments on behalf of the Forest Landowners Association. This concludes my remarks. [The prepared statement of Mr. Jones follows:] Prepared Statement of Scott P. Jones, Executive Vice President, Forest Landowners Association, Atlanta, GA RE: The Renewable Electricity Standard: Implications for Sustaining Family Forests\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ See the final pages for ``Points of this Testimony'' Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to speak about the implications of a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) for America's family forest owners. Today, I will talk with you about nonindustrial, private forest landowners and the practicalities they face in trying to hold forestlands as forests; that is, how will RES markets, energy markets in general, and other market trends affect landowner inclinations to keep forestland? More specifically, will family forest owners sell wood or will they sell real estate? We stipulate--throughout this testimony--that we distinguish between forestland and forest resources. Without forestland, there can be no forest resources: clean water, clean air, wildlife habitat, healthy soils, aesthetics, recreation, and wood-based commodities. For example, the state of Georgia loses roughly acres of forestland every single day to other uses.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Harper, R.A., N. McClure, and T.G. Johnson, et al. Georgia's Possessive Forests, . U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station. Asheville, NC. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many of you have spent a lot of time on this issue and we in the forestry community appreciate it. I am Scott P. Jones, Executive Vice President of the Forest Landowners Association (FLA), a national association that supports and protects the interests of private forest landowners. I am a graduate of the University of Georgia, with a Bachelor of Science in Forest Resources, a nationally certified forester, a Georgia Registered Forester, and a forest landowner. Since , FLA has provided its members with education, information, and national grassroots advocacy. FLA's outreach on behalf of private forest landowners nationwide enhances their forestland management practices and stewardship. According to the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis program\ \, about percent of the commercial forestland in the U.S. is owned by almost million private forest landowners (I understand that there are about million farmers in the U.S.). This does not include manufacturers, it does not include Real Estate Investment Trusts, and it does not include Timberland Investment and Management Organizations\ \. It is the ``Moms and Pops''; it is us. And we are under more pressure to convert forestland to other uses than in any other time in history, and that pressure will increase. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ ``Forest Landscapes in Perspective'' USDA Forest Service, p. \ \ ``Forest Resources of the United States'' USDA Forest Service --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FLA members look forward to participating in the new markets created by developing opportunities to meet national renewable energy requirements and we wish to do this while maintaining forest health. We support the increased use of alternative energy feedstocks, in particular ``woody biomass,'' to help feed our nation's needs for energy; thereby, amongst the benefits, help to end a troubling reliance on other countries that supply energy for our homes, for our economy, for our people. To aid in this increased use, statutory and regulatory definitions of woody biomass, as a full partner with other cellulosic feedstocks, should include all wood-crops, in all forms and sizes, in addition to residues, wastes, and byproducts of processing. The use of woody biomass as a renewable energy source will provide new markets for private forest landowners and, in so doing, contribute to forest health by removing hazardous wildfire fuels, speeding recovery from natural disasters, alleviating vegetative-competition that contributes to pest and pathogens infestations, and creating economic incentives to deter conversion of forestland to other uses. Forest landowners are highly interested in the production of alternative energy feedstocks from trees, and as segments of the forest products industry continues to trend offshore, new markets can help to answer the question raised about whether forest landowners will sell trees or sell real estate. We believe that wood is necessary to meet a Renewable Electricity Standard. In a mosaic of energy sources, where each region of the country produces energy from its own, best indigenous resources, we seek a level playing field for wood. This level field-of-play will bring the same jobs and new local tax bases to forested regions as other regions will potentially enjoy. Biomass, in general, has unique attributes among other renewable energy sources. It can be burned in existing coal-fired power production with relatively minor and inexpensive modifications, and it can be generated whenever the biomass developer or utility chooses. But, we have deep concern that, under developing renewable energy markets, forestland may be disproportionately burdened by well-meaning but functionally stifling regulation, relative to other renewable energy sources and their land bases. Simple acknowledgements of the impracticality of applying agricultural principles to forestry is a small step in the right direction; for example, the seasonal-crop, closed-loop approach to energy feedstocks just has no place in dealing with a crop that can take decades to culture; i.e., trees. The negative impacts of national energy policies could create harm to all family forestlands in the U.S. Wood is a reliable feedstock, without the seasonal fluctuations or serendipity of weather that inhibit some other energy sources. And this resource is available now. In January , the New York Times headline read, ``TIMBER FAMINE NEAR, SAYS PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT''. The article said that `` ` . . . this country is in peril of a timber famine . . . ' as asserted by the President this afternoon in an address before the American Forest Congress. In the course of his remarks the President said: `If the present rate of forest destruction is allowed to continue, a timber famine is obviously inevitable. Fire, wasteful and destructive forms of lumbering, and legitimate use are together destroying our forest resources far more rapidly than they are being replaced . . . Unless the forests can be made ready to meet the vast demands which . . . growth will inevitably bring, commercial disaster is inevitable.''\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ New York Times, Jan. , ; http://query.nytimes.com/gst/ abstract.html?res= DE DE AE A C A C D CF --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here are the words straight from the Times. I think this forcefully makes the case for sustainability. Remember, pulpwood was non-existent when this quote was made, as Charles Herty ( - ) had not yet invented the pulping process. Only when we planted trees and encouraged markets did we end our brush with a timber famine. The destructive form of lumbering, then, was a process that is still called ``high grading'' trees, today. Because at that time, only a high quality part of the tree was considered valuable for lumber, and the rest of the tree was left in the woods to rot or was burned. The point here is: markets cured the ``timber famine''. Forest management for commodities did that. New markets did not create sustainability problems; they cured them. In the United States, timber growth has exceeded the harvests since . Growing-stock volume on U.S. timberland has increased percent between and . That is, the nation's forest inventory accrued more volume than it lost by mortality and harvest by over one-third.\ \ Today, you will likely hear that adding a new RES market to existing markets will create an unsustainable resource. It is simply not true. We do not have enough markets for the wood that we are growing, as shown in the USDA Forest Services Resource Planning Act (RPA) data collected by the Forest Inventory Analysis program. The data showed that across all species in the United States, we were growing percent more volume then we removed\ \. Now, with the reduction of forest products manufacturing, we have seen an increase in the amount of growth versus removal. The RPA data shows a percent volume grown over removal\ \. The impact of the reduction of our forest products manufacturing is having a clear effect on the amount of wood being grown and the threat to the health of our forests and private forest landowners is eminent. We believe arguments to the contrary are likely disingenuous and perhaps more motivated by competition for raw materials and/or feedstock preferences and/or tax avoidance than resource sustainability. The forest resource is sustainable and this question has been asked and answered before. But, the willingness of forest landowners to maintain forestland as forestland has had too little attention. Federal forest policy must address the conundrum of what would motivate a forest landowner to continue to hold that investment when it is threatened by new and evolving forces; whether it is opportunities for better financial returns for their families, shrinking market access, or investment-dampening legislation and regulation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ ``Report on Terms Used in Biomass Credit Legislation'' BioResource Management, Inc., Richard Schroeder May , \ \ Forest Resources of the United States, .

Some well-meaning organizations want renewable energy, but want to dictate which forests can participate. Currently, percent of our nation's private forestland is natural. In the southeastern United States, on private lands, percent of forestland is natural. However, with the current definition of ``renewable biomass'' for the Renewable Fuels Standard of the Energy Independence and Security Act (at its most restrictive), America's natural private forestlands are excluded from participation in the initiative to establish a renewable fuels industry. This kind of policy creates disincentives for private forest landowners to continue to hold and manage their forestlands. Anecdotally, we know that this language has already resulted in acres and acres of tree removals for conversion to other land uses. This same definition will result, we believe, in land dedicated to fuel production at the expense of other traditional markets. In order to promote the continuation of sustainably managed forests on private lands, we must encourage markets for these landowners; voluntary markets. No definition that harms capital investment in energy facilities or taints the siting of those facilities can benefit the future of America's forestlands. Without broad, inclusive definitions for woody biomass, we are only encouraging the loss of private forestlands to other uses that typically are less environmentally friendly. So, our growing population leads to conversion. Fewer markets and less market access leads to conversion. And the constraints of new laws lead to conversion. The message is that constraints on the resource lead to conversion of forestland to other uses. How can one argue that disincentives to keep an investment--in this instance, privately held forestland--improve the likelihood of it continuance or its sustainability? Then, it is in the best interest of all who want to maintain a forested America to seek out incentives for forest landowners. The highest current concern to these landowners regards the definition of ``woody biomass'' in statute and regulation. That is, woody biomass should be defined as ``wood'' in addition to wood residues, wastes, and/or byproducts. Ultimately, we must sustainably harvest trees as pulpwood, sawtimber, poles, pilings, chip-n-saw, OSB, wafferboard, and ``energy-wood.'' Landowners would like to see wood as an equal partner with grains, grasses, and all cellulosic feedstocks. The inclusion of a ``shadow'' federal forest practices act is not the purpose of a Renewable Portfolio Standard or any energy bill. American forest landowners already operate under and comply with some of the most strenuous environmental laws and regulations on the globe. Forest practice policies are better determined at the local level to account for differences in local conditions and needs rather than through prescriptive, one-size-fits-all federal mandates. In addition to reducing our dependence on traditional fuels and their finite availability, we hope to see increased production of clean alternative energy products; products that we are told are environmentally cleaner than traditional products. Wood energy sources are also renewable, abundant, and economically competitive. An incentive-based approach, working within the market system, would create new opportunities and incentives for forest landowners, as segments of the forest products industry and associated markets trend toward an offshore future and other pressures to convert amass. At this time, states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to require alternative energy feedstocks--Renewable Portfolio Standards-- for electric power production. A similar national commitment to incentives for energy production from alternative feedstock would contribute mightily to energy production and secure forestland investments with the surety, security, and certainty of a nation committed to long-term alternative energy production and maintaining family forestlands. These forest lands require a long term commitment. Most family forest landowners will only see one or two harvest in their lifetime. America needs landowners confident in their forestland investments, so that these owners continue to see forestland as competitive and to deter forest conversions to other uses. In conclusion, we believe we can help construct an approach that addresses concerns about environmental sideboards, while appropriately relying on existing practices and capabilities. With inclusive language for wood in the Renewable Electricity Standard in place, the Forest Landowners Association will use our resources, including our grassroots networks, to promote legislation that fairly includes the use of wood biomass to meet our nation's energy needs. In fact, we have already begun work with land-based allies and with the environmentalist community in an effort to address any forest health pressures that may arise from new energy-wood markets. Now to offer an answer to the question of whether landowners will sell wood or sell real estate: we've got it, let's use it. I thank the Chairman, the Ranking member, and the Members of the Committee for the opportunity to have made these comments on behalf of the members of the Forest Landowners Association. This concludes my remarks. I would be glad to respond to any questions that any member of the committee may have and, later, deliver materials and information that may help to further clarify our position. Points of this Testimony: Forest Landowners Association members look forward to participating in the new markets created by developing opportunities to meet national renewable energy requirements and we wish to do this while maintaining forest health. New markets for forest landowners will help sustain forestland and curtail conversions. FLA opposes the creation of a federal forest practices and/ or land-use act. FLA is prepared to help craft good legislation. Trees are an abundant, sustainable, renewable, and reliable energy source. A few are using an argument of ``threat to sustainability,'' which we believe disingenuous and perhaps more motivated by competition for raw materials and/or feedstock preferences and/ or tax avoidance. Wood is necessary to meet the standard. FLA is prepared to help pass well-crafted legislation. Make wood an equal partner with other cellulosic feedstocks and the lands producing them. FLA is currently working with allies, including the environmentalist community, to address any forest health pressures that may arise from this new market. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Dr. Lave, go right ahead. STATEMENT OF LESTER B. LAVE, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, HIGGINS PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS & PROFESSOR OF ENGINEERING & PUBLIC POLICY, CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY, PITTSBURGH, PA Mr. Lave. Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of the committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify on this important legislation. At Carnegie Mellon University, I'm a senior professor in the Business Engineering and H. John Heinz Colleges. Granger Morgan and I direct the Electricity Industry Center, and I'm director of the Green Design Institute. I have the privilege of serving on two National Academy of Sciences Committees that Chairman Bingaman requested to take a look at America's energy future. The opinions here are strictly my own. Chairman Bingaman, as I listened to your remarks, to the remarks of Senator Murkowski and Senator Menendez, as I've listened to the remarks of the other people here, I heard a lot of goodwill. I heard people of goodwill who are trying to solve a problem. So, I think we're agreeing on what the goals are. I'm here to try and testify on how to achieve those goals in the smartest possible way with the least disruption. I think that the legislation here is good legislation in pushing us in this direction, but I would recommend two changes to it. The first is, I think that the definition of ``efficiency'' is not quite as tight as it should be. I think it ought to be tightened. Then, after that, I don't see a reason to restrict how much efficiency can contribute to this. The second is, as we've been hearing from other people, I'm most concerned about carbon dioxide emissions when we talk about electricity, and I think that's what our focus ought to be. In doing that, I think that we ought to avoid the mistakes that we made in the s, which is to have either Congress or the Department of Energy choose the winning technologies. I think that we need to let the engineers and entrepreneurs find out what are the winning technologies, whatever they might be, in contrast to what happened in the s; the winning technologies turned out to not be the ones that people were sure would actually turn out. I praise your emphasis on efficiency in the legislation. It's clearly our cheapest energy resource. I praise your support of distributed generation and combined heat and power. I agree that, in the long run, renewables will provide our energy. But, I think that we have to be careful not to pick the technology that we think is going to win. I think that we ought to be trying to face the issues more directly. So, let me start off with carbon dioxide. The world has about billion tons of fossil fuels. We've burned about percent of that. If we were to burn any substantial portion of that without carbon capture and sequestration, we would certainly have major global climate change. In order to avoid that, I think it is necessary, not just to take a look at a - or - or even -percent renewable portfolio standard, we need to address carbon. It's--if you had a -percent renewable portfolio standard, that would still leave percent of the electricity that could be generating CO and causing other problems. So, it's not that I'm arguing that we ought to have a higher standard, it is that we ought to be addressing that problem most directly. I distributed some maps of wind and solar resources. There have been some good comments on wind, so I will not talk about that, but let me talk about the solar stuff. Again, I'm trying to talk about how to achieve our goals in the smartest, most cost-effective way. When you look at those maps, Senator Bingaman, your State comes out really well. The desert Southwest does very well on this. As you get further north and as you get further east, the solar resource goes down. So, I love solar, but if you're trying to do solar in a place that doesn't have very many solar resources, then you're going to wind up demonstrating that we're doing something that is expensive and doesn't make a lot of sense. So, again, I praise you for not having a solar set- aside here, but I think that, when we think about this, we ought to be thinking about it in a hardheaded way, not just in terms of what it is that we think ought to be very good. So, in my written testimony, I've emphasized what are some of the difficulties of having renewable resources. I don't mean that in a mean-spirited way; I mean that those are really the difficulties that we have to overcome. So, just finally here, Senator Bingaman, I commend you for this important legislation. I want to emphasize that we want to have as much flexibility as possible. So, I have two recommendations. One is to tighten the definition of ``efficiency'' and let it contribute much more to the standard. The second is to focus on reducing carbon dioxide rather than singling out renewables as the answer. Thank you very much for the opportunity to testify, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Lave follows:] Prepared Statement of Lester B. Lave, University Professor, Higgins Professor of Economics & Professor of Engineering & Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski, and members of this committee. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify on this important legislation. At Carnegie Mellon University, I am a senior faculty member in the Business, Engineering, and H. John Heinz colleges. Granger Morgan and I direct the Electricity Industry Center and I am director of the Director Green Design Institute. I have the privilege of serving on two National Academy of Sciences committee studying energy issues. The opinions here are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of my coauthors, Carnegie Mellon University, or any other institution. I praise the draft legislation and recommend that you: . Tighten the definition of efficiency and eliminate the limit on its contribution. This will allow regions that don't have good wind and solar resources to meet the legislative goals at lower cost. . Focus on reducing carbon-dioxide emissions rather than singling out renewables as the answer. There are significant savings from letting all technologies compete in satisfying the goals of lowering greenhouse gas emissions, increasing environmental quality more generally, increasing energy security, and improving sustainability, I commend you for Title VIII-Renewable Portfolio Standard. The basic approach is sound and well thought out. I share your goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving environmental quality more generally, making our energy supply more sustainable, enhancing energy security, and of ensuring that energy prices are not so high that they derail the economy or prevent Americans from living well. I praise your emphasis on efficiency, our cheapest energy ``resource'' and your support of distributed generation and combined heat and power. I agree that in the long term, renewable fuels will likely provide our energy. Finally, I commend you for generally trying to eschew picking the winning technologies. Let engineers and entrepreneurs find the best way of meeting the goals. Unfortunately, there are significant difficulties and costs in implementing a federal RPS. While the industry struggles to meet your goal of a % RPS by , % of generation could be emitting carbon- dioxide, polluting the air and water, and using imported oil and natural gas. My point is not that the RPS should be higher, but rather that the legislation should address the issues directly. My greatest concern for electricity generation is abating carbon- dioxide emissions. Without controls, we will run out of atmosphere before we run out of fossil fuels. The world has , billion tons of fossil fuels, of which we have used only %. Burning any appreciable fraction of the coal, oil, and natural gas resources will send atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations to far greater levels than humans have experienced and lead to major global climate change. Global climate change, not our stock of fossil fuels limits how much electricity we can generate from these fuels. A carbon portfolio standard (CPS) would address this concern directly and more effectively. The available renewables technologies have quite different carbon emissions; giving equal credit to all doesn't make sense. Other technologies also have low carbon emissions and should receive attention. The maps I have provided of wind and solar resources show vast differences among states. For example, the Southeast has neither good wind nor solar resources. It does have biomass, but that will be needed for producing liquid fuels. The legislation should give each region the greatest flexibility to achieve the goals at least cost, including focusing on renewables or conservation, fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and nuclear. I emphasize efficiency since it has no emissions of air or water pollution, no greenhouse gas emissions, and does not harm the environment. After tightening the definition of efficiency in the draft legislation, I see no reason to limit efficiency's contribution to %. The efficiency definition should include distributed generation and combined heat and power, since their virtue stems from increased efficiency, not merely from having such a program. The energy efficiency accomplishments in states, such as California and New York, show a vast potential for efficiency, one greater than the likely contribution of renewables. Electricity use per capita in these two states is % less than the national average, twice the RPS goal for . I recommend aggressive goals for energy efficiency, particularly in regions such as the Southeast that have poor wind and solar resources. Achieving the increases mandated in the bill requires building large amounts of transmission from areas with good wind resources to population centers. Many people like wind turbines in the abstract but don't want them as neighbors, for example, the proposed wind farm off Cape Cod. More people oppose transmission lines. If the wind farms and transmission lines can be sited, there are likely to be delays of ten years or more, particularly for transmission. Trading renewable credits will be limited by the combination of transmission constraints and the fact that the best wind resources are located far from population centers. If the excellent wind resources in the upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains cannot be exported, the local populations could use only a small proportion of the generation potential. For large amounts of wind and solar to enter the grid, there must be inexpensive bulk storage of electricity. R&D into technologies such as compressed air is needed. Until bulk storage is possible, integrating more than % wind and solar power into the system will be costly and could compromise reliability. I now summarize the difficulty of integrating large amount of wind and solar energy into the electricity grid. As you know, wind and solar generation differ from the traditional ways of generating electricity because they are generally not available when we need power. Wind turbines and solar arrays generate electricity when the wind blows and the sun shines. One of the best solar sites in the USA is in the Sonora Desert in Arizona. A very large solar site there had a capacity factor of %, out of the possible %, if it had generated full power every hour of the year. Wind turbines have higher potential in good wind sites but, for example, the average capacity factor for the wind turbines in Texas was only % in . The solar map shows that the good sites are in the desert Southwest. Sites in the Southeast have lower potential because of cloud cover. The rest of the continental USA has much lower potential for generating solar power, particularly the most heavily populated areas. The capacity factor is important because almost all the costs are in manufacturing and installing the array. Thus, a solar array with a capacity factor of % would produce electricity at half the cost of an array with a capacity factor of %. Forcing solar installations into the areas where most Americans reside would consume a vast amount of resources per kilowatt-hour. Nature is more generous in distributing good wind sites around the nation, but they are still distant from population centers. In particular, note that there are no good wind sites in the Southeast. As with solar, the cost of produced power is inversely related to the capacity factor since almost all the costs are building the wind farm. Thus a site with a capacity factor of % would have half the cost per kilowatt-hour as a site with a % capacity factor. In general wind and solar power are not available when demand is highest. Wind tends to be strongest at night and lowest in the summer. Solar power is best in the summer, but the Arizona data show that the arrays have all but stopped producing electricity by PM in the summer, just as demand is hitting its peak. Another problem is that wind and solar generation are variable. Wind speed changes from moment to moment and clouds block the sun, even in the desert. This intermittent power challenges the grid to provide reliable, high quality power when wind and solar are contributing more than - % of total generation. One solution to both these problems is to store large amounts of electricity when these sources are generating so that it can smooth power output and have that output available when demand is high. Pumped hydro storage is the best way to store electricity, but few new sites are available. Compressed air storage looks promising, but is expensive and less efficient than pumped hydro. Wind farms can affect climate just downwind, reducing precipitation. Massive reliance on wind energy would take energy out of the wind, changing the Earth Climate. With present technology, the unreliability of generation from wind and solar means that reliable generation must backup every kilowatt- hour. A solar array or wind farm may not generate power for days because of a storm or lack of wind. Since we still want electricity, fossil fuel or hydro power must be available. A General Electric study for Texas found that even in windy April, there were hours when the wind farms were producing almost no power, requiring a rapid switch to natural gas turbines. Since this occurred during one of the windiest months, image the difficulties during the summer months when the demand for electricity peaks and wind resources are small. The point is that wind and solar can lower the amount of fossil fuels used for generation, but they don't lessen the need for reliable generation capacity. For new coal generation with carbon capture and sequestration, and for new nuclear generators, the capital cost is the vast majority of new costs and so the savings are small. I have focused my remarks on wind and solar, but there are other renewables. Hydroelectric dams generate six times as much power today as the other renewables, but there is little prospect for getting significantly more power. Dams are being torn down, not being built. Geothermal provides power in California and more is planned for the Southwest. Run of the river hydro could provide small amounts of power. Biomass could provide significant amounts of power at competitive costs, but there is a limited amount of land and the biomass is better used for transportation fuels. Where there are good geothermal resources, this resource can be attractive. However, the good areas are limited to the West. Ocean currents and waves can provide power, but corrosion and withstanding storms make the power expensive, in addition to other problems. In good sites, wind power is competitive with new fossil generation with carbon capture and sequestration. Even at the best sites, solar photovoltaic generation is several times the cost of wind per kilowatt- hour. Japan engaged in a massive program of subsidizing solar; Germany is currently engaged in huge subsidies. While clever in many ways, the Japanese and Germans don't seem to understand that extracting power from sunlight, when there is relatively little sunlight, is expensive. The solar map shows that trying to generate solar power in most of the USA would be extremely expensive. At good sites, solar thermal power is almost competitive with new fossil generation. This catalogue of difficulties should not be regarded as mean- spirited objections. Rather, my intent is to set out the problems that need to be solved. We agree that our energy supply must be made sustainable; we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy security, and produce energy at a cost that will not derail our economy. America's largest fossil fuel resource is coal; we will rely on coal for much of our energy in the coming decades. In particular, coal will continue to provide most baseload electricity generation. It is essential that demonstration coal plants with carbon capture be built to improve the technology and that DOE shows that massive underground injection of carbon-dioxide in a range of geological strata can sequester the carbon without leakage. It is also essential that we build half a dozen nuclear plants using the new technology to assess their costs and performance. While solar photovoltaic power is too expensive for massive deployment, I urge funding solar photovoltaics research, since this technology will ultimately provide most of our energy. I also recommend R&D funding for bulk electricity storage, such as compressed air. Chairman Bingaman, I commend you for this bill. I particularly commend you for not trying to identify the technology winners, such as through a solar mandate. I hope that you can make two changes: . Tighten the definition of efficiency and eliminate the limit on its contribution. This will allow regions that don't have good wind and solar resources to comply at lower cost. . Focus on reducing carbon-dioxide rather than singling out renewables as the answer. There are significant savings from letting all technologies compete in satisfying the goals of lowering greenhouse gas emissions, increasing environmental quality more generally, increasing energy security, and improving sustainability, ensuring that energy prices are not so high that they derail the economy. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important legislation. I would be happy to answer any questions. The Chairman. Thank you. Thank you all for your excellent testimony. Let me start with a few questions. Dr. Izzo, you've indicated that New Jersey has an aggressive solar program. Dr. Lave just indicated that he thinks having a carve-out for solar doesn't make good sense, given the variations in solar resources around the country. You have a carve-out for solar in New Jersey. Yours is one of the States with less solar resources, certainly, than a lot of the country. What's your reaction to that? Do you think, as a national matter, we should be trying to have a carve-out like you've got there in New Jersey, or not? Mr. Izzo. Our preferred approach would be to have just the one national standard, and then to use the tax code to help those nascent industries that need additional help. That would include both solar and offshore wind. The Chairman. So, you would not favor any kind of carve-out for---- Mr. Izzo. I would allow the States to have their own carve- outs in their programs, but not in the Federal program. The Chairman. OK. Now, also, as I understood Dr. Lave's testimony, he was saying that we should not limit the amount of whatever standard is established, whether it's percent or percent, whatever--the amount that you could achieve through efficiency should not be limited. Do you agree with that, or disagree? Mr. Izzo. I disagree with that position. We need every tool in our toolkit possible to achieve the -percent reduction, and we have separate programs on energy efficiency, which we're aggressively pursuing. Similarly, we need to pursue carbon capture and storage on fossil fuel generation in the R&D space. We need to pursue new nuclear. Those are all separate issues. All will be needed on top of renewables. The Chairman. OK. So, you think having some national requirement for production of--or--electricity from renewables, separate from a national requirement for improved energy efficiency, it makes good sense. Mr. Izzo. That's correct, Senator. Because, if you think about it, electricity is percent of the CO generated in this Nation. This bill proposes that we have percent of it come from renewables. Twenty percent of percent is percent. We're nowhere near the -percent reduction. We will need to do all the things we've talked about. The Chairman. OK. Commissioner Wright, I was interested in your testimony. It seems as though you're arguing that, not only are States in the Southeast, such as South Carolina, unable to achieve the requirement that we're talking about here with regard to production from renewables, also it's very, very difficult, because of the economic circumstances you face, for you to achieve the energy efficiency reductions--or, improvements that we're talking about, that it's inappropriate for us to have a national requirement with regard to improved efficiency, as well. Is that your position? Mr. Wright. Yes, sir. You've got a lot of issues, but obviously we--in the Southeast region, we have low-income families and households, and they also live in housing that is inefficient, from an energy perspective, too. If they're not mobile homes, it's other types of housing. Because, you know, we've got -percent unemployment in South Carolina right now; it's going to be percent, they say, this time next year. So, it compounds itself. We believe that energy efficiency, under the RPS that you've got, that we're talking about today, the money leaves the State. We believe, if we do have an RPS, if it--that's where the Congress would like to go--and we're not opposed to a State-based RPS, but one that fits our area. The money--if there were penalties paid, if there were compliance payments, that money should be reinvested back in the State, where it can be used to improve efficiency. The Chairman. I remember a speech I heard Millard Fuller give, the founder of Habitat for Humanity, where he was saying that the people that they are building houses for can't afford large mortgages, and they also can't afford large utility bills. Therefore, they're building energy-efficient houses, Habitat for Humanity is. So, there's a little bit of a disconnect with saying, ``Because the people are low-income in our State, we can't expect to see improvements in energy efficiency.'' Mr. Wright. You've also got--and I mentioned it in my longer version of the testimony, too--you've got a literacy problem, too, where they--it's just a hard thing for them to understand what they can do. You know, they're level- and level- , a significant portion of these people, and it's just hard for us to--in the Southeast, to have the money leave our region and not be able to stay there, where it would--we could use it. The Chairman. I'm reminded of our former President's concern about the tyranny of low expectations---- [Laughter.] The Chairman [continuing]. Taking charge right here, as well. Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Lave, in your comments, I think you suggested that the goal we are all seeking is the same, but then you went on to state that by focusing on a renewable energy standard, we're not necessarily getting to that goal of reduction in carbon. There was an article submitted to the New York Times, at the end of January, written by the CEO of Entergy, and he suggested the same thing for his company, if we move to a renewable energy standard, they will stop doing research towards carbon sequestration, then how they can actually get to that clean coal technology? They will switch their focus to other areas and they won't be working to reduce their emissions. Are we in agreement as to what it is that we are attempting to achieve with the renewable energy standard? Is it the reduction of emissions, or is it an increase in renewable energy production? Mr. Lave. Senator, that's a very good question. I think that at least my goals are to try and achieve--or, my--to try and achieve the goals at least cost. But, when you have an RPS, you reduce carbon dioxide emissions by much less than you would have thought, because you need to have backup for all of the solar and wind, and generally that backup is a natural-gas turbine, and generally that natural-gas turbine is having to function at much less than full power, and so, being relatively inefficient. So, for example, if we were to achieve this - percent renewable portfolio standard with wind and solar, you would have much less than a -percent reduction in carbon dioxide. So, I think that at least my goals are to try and focus on these social goals of lowering greenhouse gas emissions, increasing environmental quality, increasing energy security, improving sustainability, and lowering costs. I think that not everybody has exactly those goals. Senator Murkowski. Let me ask a question about the regional disparity. You've supplied us with a couple of maps. I think we know that, across the Nation, wind is not equal, solar is not equal, biomass is not equal. I think that there is a disparity. Mr. Furman, you've suggested that it's not discriminatory, and if in fact, you are going to apply, a one-size-fits-all standard, you will have areas that perhaps will not be on an even playing field. How can we best address the regional disparity? Mr. Wright, you have suggested that the States need to develop their own renewable energy plans. There's been a discussion about whether or not you cap the efficiency aspect of it. Should we allow additional sources of clean energy to be counted? What is the best way to deal with the regional disparity? I only have a minute left, so I'd like you to very quickly go down the line. Mr. Izzo. Mr. Izzo. The regional disparities are things we live with all the time. New Jersey has no coal, no natural gas, and no uranium , yet we produce nuclear energy, coal-fired power, and natural-gas-fired power. We're very grateful that other market sell that stuff to us. Senator Murkowski. All, but none of which is counted in your renewable energy standard. Mr. Izzo. Correct. But, so, too, a national renewable portfolio standard will allow us to source renewable energy from those places where it's most efficient to source it from. Senator Murkowski. OK. Mr. Furman. Mr. Furman. The most important factor, to me, is a functioning renewable energy certificate trading market so that Commissioner Wright's consumers, for example, don't have to build a wind farm in South Carolina. It's not economic. But, what they can do is, they can buy the certificate from somebody who develops a wind farm in the Northwest or in the Upper Midwest, where it is economic, and they'll pay the same price that somebody in the Midwest would pay. Senator Murkowski. Commissioner. Mr. Furman. To me, that is the best way to equalize the economic---- Senator Murkowski. Commissioner. Mr. Wright. We buy our coal and we buy our uranium outside, it's--power's produced for our consumers inside the State. So, there is a benefit for our consumers in keeping costs low. If we have to send our money out, that's driving the cost of power up for our consumers, because we have to send that money as a compliance payment. Senator Murkowski. Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones. In my comments on--addressing the regional disparities would be a broad, inclusive definition that recognizes woods' full capability to play a role in a renewable energy package, where percent of the wood that's currently being grown in the southeastern United States or across our country is being excluded from renewables. So, a broad, inclusive definition that would allow it to reach its full capability of being used as a renewable source. Senator Murkowski. Dr. Lave. Mr. Lave. There is something said here that's wrong. This notion that if we had tradable certificates, that the price would be the same in every region is just not correct. I have a Ph.D. student who's done a thesis looking at getting wind energy from the Powder River Basin to southern California. The transmission line itself would more than double the cost of getting the power there. So, if we had to build these thousands--tens of thousands of miles of long-distance transmission to get wind or solar energy to the major places where it's consumed, then I guess we could bear those costs as a Nation, but that's usually not the way we do things. I think the buyer has to pay those costs. So, the cost of power to places where you had to transmit it a long way would be a lot higher than the cost of power where it was generated. Senator Murkowski. Thank you. The Chairman. Senator Dorgan. Senator Dorgan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It seems to me that the lack of some sort of central goal or aspiration for our country has been prevalent for a long, long while. The proposal of a renewable portfolio standard to just say, ``Let's decide where America wants to head, here. Let's decide, for the next decade, where we want to go with respect to energy.'' I'm listening to this, and it's kind of interesting. The fact is, Commissioner Wright, you all have about percent of your power from nuclear, about percent from coal---- Mr. Wright. Sixty---- Senator Dorgan. All right. Mr. Wright. Sixty-one from coal, according to the PURC report that came out. Senator Dorgan. All right, then it can't be from nuclear---- Mr. Wright. Right. Senator Dorgan [continuing]. But, the fact is, you import coal and uranium to produce that power. So, we've built rail lines and barge lines, and so on, to be able to ship these things to where you need it. But, we had testimony in this committee from T. Boone Pickens and many others, about the goal of trying to build a national transmission grid, a sort of an interstate highway of transmission, to be able to produce renewable where you can produce it, and to move it where it's needed. I think that's necessary. We've certainly built rail lines and so on to accommodate the ability to move coal. We ought to do this with respect to transmission lines. If we're going to move toward an electric-drive-vehicle future, nearly percent of the oil we use in the transportation fleet comes from outside of our country--if we're going to do all this, it seems to me you logically have to create some sort of renewable energy standard. A number of States have moved in that direction, but I think our country would be well advised to have a national standard. We've tried it a good many times. I hope this is the time when we will make that happen. Having said that, I support coal development. The one point I would make, Dr. Lave, is, that--the implication of your suggestion is, that nothing else is happening. We've got $ . billion for carbon-capture-and-storage research just in the economic recovery bill. The Energy and Commerce subcommittee, which I chair is putting a lot of money into research. I'm convinced that we're going to be able to use coal in the future, and de-carbonized coal. So, it's not as if nothing else is happening. But, I just wanted to make those points, because I think the testimony has been really interesting. Mr. Furman, I think you made the point, as well, about being able to produce renewables from wherever you can maximize that production, and moving it on a grid. Was that the point you were making? Mr. Furman. It is. Thank you, Senator, because I think there's two aspects to this regional issue that I think are being misunderstood. One is, we do need more transmission, in general, not just for renewables; we've got to do it anywhere. I testified a few months ago here about that issue. But, in addition, if you are buying a certificate, if you are complying, not by buying power out of a wind farm, but let's assume that I--my company builds a -megawatt wind farm in North Dakota--which we are doing, actually--and we have a national REC market, renewable-energy-certificate market; we can sell those certificates into the market, and we can also sell the power into the grid. Now, somebody from South Carolina can buy that certificate, somebody from North Dakota can buy that certificate. It's the same price, and you turn it in for your compliance. It doesn't require, as Dr. Lave suggested, that we transmit the power to South Carolina; it simply requires that we sell the energy into the grid and then sell that certificate on the open market. It is a much more fair, egalitarian way of addressing the economics. There are regional disparities. Senator Dorgan. Yes. There's an old saying, ``If you don't care where you're going, you're never going to be lost.'' The point is, we need to have a direction, here, as a country. I think one of the questions that has been raised by some of you is about the market system. I can't think of a more effective system in the world to allocate goods and services than the free market, frankly. But, there are times when it's very important to decide, ``Here's where we want to go,'' set a direction, and then try to allow that market system to work inside that set of goals. I do not think a Renewable Portfolio Standard is in conflict at all with a market system. But, I think if we just decide, ``You know what, we'll just let whatever happens happen,'' I don't think we'll ever get to , or percent renewable energy, because there are a lot of other ways for others to subvert that. I think it's in our country's interest to decide to produce more of our electricity from renewable sources. So, you all have, I think, given us a lot to think about, and to my colleague Senator Murkowski, I think, too, there are probably things that can be contributed to this discussion and the creation of some sort of Renewable Portfolio Standard that can come from all areas of philosophy here on this committee. I look forward to the discussion that we can have to try to determine how we do a lot of things well--produce coal, in a manner that is protective of our environment, substantially increase renewable energy, and make us less dependent on foreign oil, which I think is a huge vulnerability for the future of this country. The question is, how do we do all of these things well. The Chairman. Senator Corker. Senator Corker. I didn't realize it was my turn, down here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have to tell you that I think there are so many things right now that could unite our country around energy. I think there is a tremendous desire that this country be energy- secure. I think there's a tremendous desire that we do so in an environmentally sound way. It troubles me that the first thing we do, right out of the chutes, is discuss a policy that divides our country. It's an amazing thing to me. I think there's a possibility that, as a country, we could come together around something that's transparent, relating to cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, that would do the exact market things that Senator Dorgan was talking about. Yet, today we seek a policy that divides our country, that discriminates. Now, if this is the first priority of this Administration--and I know that was said in earlier comments--I don't know if that's true or not, but if it is, it's an amazing thing to me that we would start out with such a crass policy that separates this country. Mr. Furman, to say that it's not a transference of wealth for Mr. Wright to have to purchase certificates, which cost money, to meet an obligation so that it can be met in another part of a country--of our country, it's just not true. I mean, that's just absolutely not true. I don't think you would agree with this, but would it not be the same to say that, if you're going to benefit from any kind of national subsidies, like this would create, that we would make you build wind farms in every part of the country with your own money? That would be a national standard, and maybe that's one I could get behind, if you were doing it with your own money. But, explain to me how, in fact, if he has to buy certificates to meet a standard, and send money to you, that is not a transference of wealth. Mr. Furman. I think we will probably---- Senator Corker. Please be very brief. Mr. Furman. Yes, I---- Senator Corker. He would have to buy--pay money to buy those certificates, is that correct? They would go to another part of the country. Just ``yes, yes,'' or ``no, no.'' Mr. Furman. Every---- Senator Corker. I mean---- Mr. Furman. Yes, everyone will buy a certificate in the country. Senator Corker. OK. Mr. Furman. Everybody will pay for it, and we'll be essentially the same price. There may be small regional differences. But, everybody will do that. Senator Corker. OK. Mr. Furman. So, it would be---- Senator Corker. So, it is a transference of wealth. Mr. Furman. It's a transfer--well, in the sense that--sure, you will pay me to money to---- Senator Corker. OK. Mr. Furman [continuing]. Build my wind farm, and make an investment in---- Senator Corker. What about if we made you build wind farms in Tennessee if you're receiving--you don't want to build 'them there, because there's no wind; you don't want to build solar, because there's no solar. But, what if we made you do that? Would you like that transference of wealth? Mr. Furman. If--I don't--first of all, I'm not sure that's a transference of wealth, because we would only do it if we got a reasonable investment return. Senator Corker. Which---- Mr. Furman. Second, I think it would be inefficient--it would be a higher-cost solution to what we're talking about. The best wind resources are in the Northwest--or in the Upper Midwest, and that's where you should---- Senator Corker. Let me--in the desert areas of our country, if we said they had to use hydro power there, how would you-- how do you--is that a good idea? Mr. Furman. That--it's a bad idea. Senator Corker. What about, in the desert, if we said you had to use biomass. Is that a good idea? Mr. Furman. Of course not. Senator Corker. OK, then I just--I guess what I would say, Mr. Chairman, we have an opportunity, in a few months, I think, to debate something, like cap-and-trade, or to potentially have a carbon tax, both of which we could return percent of the money back to taxpayers, and it would be very transparent, and it would create a market system. I have no idea why we would take this transference-of-wealth component out that--we have many environmentalists in our State. I happen to be one of them. OK? I happen to support some of these other initiatives. I cannot imagine why this administration would chose, on the front end, to divide our country--to divide our country instead of focusing on uniting our country around something that would create exactly the market-based system that Senator Dorgan is talking about, and not pit one part of our country against another. Dr. Izzo, let me ask you this, would you be willing to build windmills and solar systems in Tennessee, with your own money, if we had sort of a national standard that said you had to do this in every part of our country? Mr. Izzo. Yes, we would. We would charge you the cost of doing that, and your customers---- Senator Corker. You wouldn't be able to sell it, of course, at that cost, but you'd be willing to do that---- Mr. Izzo. That's my point. Senator Corker [continuing]. With your own money? Mr. Izzo. That's my point, is that we would do it wherever people wanted to, but there are places that it's lower cost to do it. Senator Corker. OK. Mr. Izzo. So, you would have a choice, in Tennessee, of paying us cents a kilowatt hour or paying cents a kilowatt hour to somebody in Arizona. Senator Corker. Yes. Mr. Izzo. The choice would be up to Tennessee. Senator Corker. That's a transference of wealth, isn't it? Mr. Izzo. It's the same as when we buy coal from the Midwest or when we buy natural gas from the Gulf or when we buy corn from the Midwest. Senator Corker. No, because you're producing it in your own State, which is a whole---- Mr. Izzo. Not producing the coal or the natural gas. Senator Corker. You're producing the power from that in your own State. OK. Mr. Chairman, I would hope that, with all the troubles that our country has right now, that, instead of creating this divisive picking of winners and losers, we would, instead, focus on something that will unite our country. I would just love if you would respond: Would a cap-and-trade system not actually affect carbon and global warming, that you care about so deeply, much better than having a renewable portfolio standard? Mr. Izzo. A cap-and-trade system would be the underpinning of making intelligent market decisions. Senator, I never once, for a second, thought that a cap-and- trade system, given the regional variations in carbon intensivity would be any less divisive than the conversation we're having now. The Chairman. I hope we get a chance to test that proposition later---- [Laughter.] The Chairman [continuing]. Later this year, and have an opportunity to do something on cap-and-trade in the Congress, as well. Let's see, Senator Stabenow is next. Senator Stabenow. Thank you. First of all, Mr. Chairman, we are honored to be a member of this committee, as a new member who has tremendous interest, coming from my home State of Michigan, in energy. I want to thank you for your ongoing leadership on so many issues, and to our distinguished ranking member, as well. So, I'm looking forward to working with the committee. I'm also looking forward to the provisions in the recovery package that really start us down the road as it relates to renewable energy incentives, and particularly around manufacturing, as well. I just want to indicate, for the record, that there are , different parts in a wind turbine, and we can make every single one of those in Michigan, just for the record. We also create about percent of the polysilicon that's used as a basic material for solar panels, in Saginaw Township, Michigan, through Dow-Corning. I'd like very much to stop shipping that out of the country to make solar panels. I'd like very much to see it made in Michigan and around the country. So, that's my plug for Michigan. It's a plug, actually, for jobs, which I believe is very much about what this is about as we look at it. I wanted to ask a question related particularly to forestry. We have million acres, in Michigan, of beautiful forests, and one of the issues that I've been focused on is the fact that, while the tons of carbon per acre in a forest can vary greatly, we know that EPA says that many of our forests have about tons per acre, we may be looking at million tons of carbon in Michigan alone, so that my concern is, if we are not focusing on how we maintain those forests, we are actually making global warming worse by releasing tons of carbon into the atmosphere. So, I'm anxious to see us have forestry policies a part of whatever we do. Mr. Jones, I wonder if you might just speak a little bit more as to the definition--if we were going to craft a definition that best used wood and forest biomass and gave your private landowners a market so they were not selling their land for a shopping mall or a residential community or whatever--if we kept those forests--first, we're keeping carbon capture-- we're stopping carbon from going into the air, but we're also then giving you a market. So, I wonder if you might just speak a little bit more about that. Mr. Jones. I think the two things can work together. With the decrease of markets, without a new market for forest products that--a good definition--a broad, inclusive definition that would say ``trees,'' include all wood products that are being grown on private lands and these other lands. Without that, I think we run the risk of--higher risk of conversion to other uses, other than forestland. When we convert the forestland to another use--a shopping mall, a residential community--we've lost it. Now we have no potential for sequestering carbon or capturing that carbon out of the air. So, what I'm looking at is saying that, with increased markets, we'll encourage, not only the retention of forestland, but hopefully the growth of new forestlands, taking marginal agricultural lands and putting them into healthy, productive forests that, not only helping us meet renewable energy goals, but are also out there sequestering carbon and meeting other goals that society would benefit from--clean water, clean air, wildlife habitat, and all these other things. So, if I look at a definition that would be in a renewable electricity standard, or an RPS, that would be encouraging, not only to the retention and growth of new forests for the CO carbon benefits and also for those other benefits, I would say one that's very broad and says ``trees.'' Currently, we have some very stringent laws and regulations, at the Federal and the regional and the State level, that monitor the health and sustainability of our forests. The Clean Water Act is a key piece of legislation that helps to make sure that we do our forest management practices correctly. Almost every State in the country has best management practices. Some in the Pacific Northwest are mandatory, in the Southeast--they're done on a voluntary basis, but they are all monitored. Every State in the country has a State forester, and they're monitoring and reporting on the health of our forests. I'd say, without an inclusion of wood or forests into a renewable energy standard with that broad definition, we do run the risk of having higher conversion rates of forests into other uses, and then we lose all those other benefits. Senator Stabenow. OK, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Senator Bennett. Senator Bennett. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, to the panel. It's been a very interesting discussion. But, it has struck me that the discussion has taken place in a stovepipe. Let's look at our overall energy situation and energy needs. The one thing that is clear to me, as I try to look at that in the future, is that we have--I think, Dr. Izzo, you have hinted at it--enormous demand for huge scale of electricity, much more than we have now. Let's, for just a moment, look at the overall energy needs. I've driven a hybrid car for years. I didn't buy it for environmental purposes, I bought it because I wanted to become familiar with the technology, to see how it would work. Senator McConnell used to call my first one ``the car you put on like a pair of pants''; it was a Honda Insight. As tall as I am, people had a hard time understanding how I got in it. Actually, it was really quite roomy once you got down that low and in that car. [Laughter.] Senator Bennett. I now drive a Ford Escape hybrid. I increased my mileage substantially. If it were a plug-in hybrid--and I have driven one of those--we could have mileage of over miles to the gallon. All right. Plug it in at night. If we had, say, million--that's years' production of new cars--plug-in hybrids on the road, that would be million batteries that could be charged with electricity at night, when the utilities are basically giving electricity away, and by--we wouldn't need to create any batteries. We would have a massive forest, if you will, of batteries that could soak up all of that electricity. That would require increased electricity. So, when you look at the scale--and then, the economy continues to grow; you're going to want more electricity. So, if you can transfer the energy required for transportation into electricity, and meet the demand for electricity, you're talking a tremendous demand. You're not going to meet that demand with wind and solar. I'm sorry. No matter how many windmills you build, no matter how many solar panels you put out, you're only going to be in single digits in the percentage of power you can provide in that kind of scale. So, the thing that strikes me about this conversation is that, with the exception of Dr. Izzo and Commissioner Wright, no one has used the word for the greatest source of noncarbon renewable power that we have in this country, and that's nuclear. Charles de Gaulle looked at France and said, ``You know, we don't have very much natural gas, we don't have very much coal. We're going to have import all our power. We're going to become nuclear.'' Eighty percent of the electric power in France comes from nuclear power, and they sell it over the border into Germany, where the greens have called a ban on nuclear power. You know, they take the nuclear power, they just don't want to have any of it in their own backyard. The French have never had any problems with storage, they've never had any problems with the fuel rods or any of the rest of it. I'd like you to forget wind and forget solar and forget biomass for just a minute in this conversation, and talk about the scale that could be achieved in noncarbon-emitting renewable that we could get from nuclear. I'd like your opinions and reactions to that. Mr. Lave. Want me to start? Senator Bennett. Yes, Dr. Lave. Mr. Lave. It was only the `` minutes'' that kept me from praising nuclear, here. But, again, trying to be smart about this, the current nuclear plants we have in the country are running with operating factors of more than percent. They're doing very well. We are on pace to build between four and seven new nuclear plants by . We're going to have to see how expensive they turn out to be. Right? There's nothing wrong with the technology. We just have to see how expensive they are. Senator Bennett. Would you support building a reprocessing, like they have in France, so that the present spent fuel rods are also turned into a major source of power? Mr. Lave. I'm looking at Chairman Bingaman on this. This National Academy of Sciences study is looking exactly at that, and I don't want to comment on that. But in---- Mr. Izzo [continuing]. About or weeks, you will have, I think, a definitive report on how much sense that makes. But, here the one thing I'm trying to emphasize is that we would like to satisfy having low-carbon electricity, and so on, at the lowest cost; that is, we'd like to get these goals so we're not wasting any money in doing it. Nuclear certainly has a role in that. How much these plants are going to wind up costing is then going to determine how much of a role nuclear will have in the future. Thank you. Senator Bennett. Thank you. Anyone else? Yes. Mr. Wright. Thank you very much for the question. We actually have three open dockets--or, two open dockets for three plants, nuclear--new reactors in South Carolina, as we speak, one, which will be voted on tomorrow, for two reactors, possibly. I believe, as you do, that, really, personally, we-- maybe we should be looking at a clean energy policy that uses everything that we've got on the table in the United States, regardless of region, to try to meet energy independence, reduce our carbon footprint, look at greenhouse gas. I mean, we're going to need it all. You are correct, that the--about the hybrids and the plug- ins and all that. I mean, those--nuclear would be the way that answers that. I believe that it has a place and it will be developed. Mr. Furman. Senator, I mean, I--just to--since you've asked the question, I don't--I don't--this is a personal opinion, but I think it was--it would probably also be reflective of my company. Nuclear, and, for that matter, clean coal, are legitimate tools in the toolbox, as Dr. Izzo pointed out. We're going to need all the tools, going forward. I think the only issue is timing. You know, you've had a number of nuclear projects that have been announced and then withdrawn, and partly that's because, as Dr. Lave pointed out, we don't know a lot about the costs of building a nuclear plant, because we haven't built one in so many years. I think what has happened is, you've seen a number of companies start to build them and then realize that the costs have gone up far more than they realized. It's a big bet, it's putting a lot of investment in a single source. Having said all of that--and similar for clean coal. Clean coal, I think, is definitely in our future. We have tremendous coal reserves; we just need to use them in a more environmentally responsible way. But, I don't think either technology is quite ready for prime time. That's a personal opinion. But, I don't think we should ever take away, from Dr. Izzo and the other utilities, the tools that we're going to need to reduce our carbon and reduce our reliance on foreign sources, as well. Mr. Izzo. I think the points have already been made. It clearly has to be part of the toolkit, and we don't know what the capital costs are. We know that nuclear plants run percent of the time, solar panels in New Jersey run percent of the time; a factor-of-- difference. There's no way I can build a new nuclear plant in years. We're putting solar panels up today. We'll have offshore wind running in years. The science keeps telling us that timing matters. The more carbon we put in the atmosphere, the more inertia we build into the system, the tougher it'll be to undo it. Senator Bennett. But, you're still operating in single digits with wind and solar, you're not addressing the scale problem. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Bayh. Senator Bayh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My first year at law school, the dean, on our first day, advised us to embrace ``exuberant skepticism.'' So, I'm going to try and follow in that tradition today. But, don't read too much into the questions I'm about to ask; I'm just trying to get to the practical bottom line here. Dr. Lave, do I have the pronunciation of your name correct? Let me start with something--and it gets to what Senator Bennett was asking, there at the end. If I understood your testimony correctly--I think one of the other panelists indicated that about percent of our CO emissions come from the generation of electricity. So, even if we embrace--and I think this is the point you were making--a - percent RPS standard, that gets us to about a -percent reduction in CO emissions. Is that an accurate representation of your testimony? Mr. Lave. Actually, less than that, because you'd---- Senator Bayh. I was going to follow up and ask and--then you---- Mr. Lave. Yes. Sure. Senator Bayh [continuing]. Referred to backup capacity. So, my question to you is, on CO emissions, If we adopt a -percent standard, what is your estimate in terms of what we would actually achieve, in terms of net CO reduction? Mr. Lave. I think that if the percent came from wind and solar, that the reduction in CO emissions would-- might be on the order of about--instead of percent, about percent of the electricity total. Right? So, that is--you're getting a little bit more than half of what it is you might assume. Senator Bayh. My math is not very good. You said-- percent of percent gets to what, about percent? Mr. Lave. Something on that, sir. Yes, sir. Senator Bayh. OK. But then, it's not all going to be wind and solar, correct? You are going to have some biomass, you are going to have some other things. If you assume that, given the geographic complexity, and given the diversity of the country, you're looking at something south of percent? Mr. Lave. I think that when--when you're looking at biomass or geothermal, then--or this new hydro--that's really a kind of a one-for-one---- Senator Bayh. OK. Mr. Lave [continuing]. That is, that's reliable. You don't need backup on those, so you really get a one-for-one reduction in CO emissions. Senator Bayh. OK. So, we're looking at about -percent, then? Mr. Lave. Perhaps, yes. Senator Bayh. If you net it all out. Mr. Lave. Yes. Senator Bayh. OK. Do any of you--there's really not much of an argument to be made that a Renewable Portfolio Standard decreases the need to import foreign oil. Is that correct? Mr. Lave. Sir, only percent of electricity is generated by oil. Senator Bayh. Right. Mr. Lave. That's generally PEDCO. So, I don't think we're talking about that. The point was made earlier about natural gas imports. If we started importing a lot of natural gas, that would be an energy security issue. I think that's likely to happen in about or years. But, there's dispute on that. Senator Bayh. So, if we wanted to really seriously tackle CO , we've got to look at things with more scale and scope. I think that's the point that Senator Bennett was making, and it seems to me that that's the point you are making. Mr. Lave. Yes, sir. Senator Bayh. Let me play the devil's advocate, here, as a former Governor, but someone who now has a national perspective and understands that sometimes that has to take precedence. Our State has considered an RPS standard in our State legislature, and has chosen not to adopt it. For those of you who support this proposal, why do you think you know more about what is in the best interests of the people of Indiana than our State legislature or our Governor? Mr. Izzo. The primary purpose of the standard is really to forge a nexus between three critical issues that are affecting, not only the nation, but the planet. The first issue is global climate change. It's not ``New Jersey climate change.'' The second issue is energy security. It's national energy security, it's not ``New Jersey energy security.'' I'm picking on my own State. Senator Bayh. Right, but---- Mr. Izzo [continuing]. Third issue is creating jobs. Senator Bayh. How does this relate to energy security? Mr. Izzo. If you electrify transportation, as I think the Nation should seek to do, you're going to just shift the carbon production from transportation to electricity. Senator Bayh. Correct, but there are other ways to generate electricity than just a Renewable Portfolio Standard. Mr. Izzo. Not carbon-free. Nuclear and renewables are the only way to do that right now. We don't have carbon capture and storage. If I put a shovel in the--if I decide, today, to invest the money needed to build a nuclear plant, it won't go COD for years. Senator Bayh. Do any of you have an estimate--our State is about--I think we get less than percent of our energy from renewables, currently; we're about percent dependent on coal generation for our electricity. Any of you care to estimate what this would do to the cost of electricity for the ratepayers in Indiana? Maybe, Mr. Wright, since that's your business, do you have any idea about that? Or any of the others, on the other side of the debate? I'd love to hear from you, too. Mr. Wright. That is a real concern for my State, but I can tell you---- Senator Bayh. This is essentially a tax increase. Mr. Wright. It is. It's been estimated that it's about-- around $ -million impact to South Carolina. I have some numbers from Arkansas, from their co-ops and from, I believe, Entergy, who does theirs, and they were talking as much as--by , $ . billion, at a rate of about $ million a year---- Senator Bayh. My time---- Mr. Wright [continuing]. For---- Senator Bayh [continuing]. Is expired, but I think your point was that if you're going to have to pay for some of these things, you'd at least like to have it returned to the State to focus on energy efficiency---- Mr. Wright. Right. Senator Bayh [continuing]. To deal with the problem you've got. Mr. Wright. The ratepayer has to pay it. That's my concern, as a regulator. I've got to watch out for the ratepayer. Senator Bayh. Mr. Chairman, my time is expired, but anybody on the other side of this debate want to address the issue of rate increases and that kind of thing? Mr. Furman. Senator, I thank you for the opportunity to address this--I think one thing that has--that is often not taken into account in some of the studies that were just cited--they're simply looking at the cost of renewables, they're not looking at the impact that renewables will have on the gas market--renewable energy, whenever we--and I used to operate a utility system, and, you know, during the energy crisis in California, you know, we were facing extraordinarily high prices. Bringing on wind, we could do it in months, we could do it very quickly, and it very--and it absolutely displaces natural- gas generation. A lot of the market for electricity generation--not everywhere, but a lot of the places in the United States--is based on the price of natural gas. So, when you drive down what--there's an economic benefit to displacing that generation. I think the other thing that I would say is, energy is national. I mean, when we operate the utility grid, you know, we have to pay attention to people like Commissioner Wright, because they drive our economics. But, the fact of the matter is, electrons go where they want, and the rest of the energy network, you know, is a free market. I mean, coal moves freely around the country, as does natural gas and other commodities. So, this is a national issue. This is an issue of national imperative, because or years will be here before we know it, and we need to get prepared, not unlike what France did with nuclear power, not unlike what Brazil has done with ethanol; they've adopted national policies, because they've made sense for the times. I think that's where we are. Senator Bayh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Senator Barrasso. Senator Barrasso. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I believe Senator Bayh is absolutely right, because nearly percent of our electricity comes from coal in Wyoming. Wyoming consumers have some of the lowest retail prices per kilowatt hour in the United States. We're at . cents a kilowatt hour for electricity in Wyoming, and it's not a coincidence that those low costs are related to coal. Coal is still the most affordable, available, reliable, and secure source of energy in the United States. I think that mandating a national renewable portfolio standard like this will have, you know, an immediate impact, and direct impact, on the people in Worland, Wyoming, and all across the communities, higher electricity costs. It doesn't seem like we heard anyone say, here, that it will not have a higher electricity cost. But, I want to get back to something Senator Bayh talked about, which was the practical bottom line. The Wall Street Journal had an article yesterday, ``New Grid for Renewable Energy Could be Costly.'' I don't know if you saw that, on page A . It talked about the , new miles of transmission line that'll be needed, about million--$ billion in cost. But, one of the things that they talked about is, the power lines will have to be built somewhere, in someone's backyard; and they thought , new miles of transmission would result in about , lawsuits. The question is, How do we, you know, address this whole issue when we take a look at legislative proposals on a renewable portfolio standard? Is it appropriate, at the exact same time, to address the regulatory, the legal issues, that create the bureaucratic hurdles, whether it's NEPA, whether it's the Endangered Species reform? Those are things that come to mind. I'd like to go down the panel to see, How do we address that as we look to try to put this national energy grid together? Mr. Izzo. Mr. Izzo. Perhaps incorrectly so, I compartmentalize this discussion into two components. Component No. is, Do we need renewable sources of energy? The answer to that is, emphatically, yes. Then the question becomes, Where do we develop them? That answer is much more complicated. That is a tradeoff between where are the resources and where are the users. Transmission is a cost that has to be applied to that. So, the factors of production may favor the Southwest for solar, but shipping that to the Northeast will add cost to it. One, therefore, has to debate, well, even though there's less sun, perhaps, someplace else that's closer, the delivery charge is less. So, the whole notion of delivery charges will influence where, but not how much. Senator Barrasso. So, you're talking about financial cost, but there's also a time cost involved in trying to go through all of these processes, which, even if the money is there to start with, day one, you're still taking a look--and Boone Pickens, when he came here, he said his biggest challenge was not the money, it was the time delay in trying to get some of these things going. Mr. Izzo. Absolutely correct, Senator. Senator Barrasso. Mr. Furman. Mr. Furman. If I could add a couple of things. One, the cost of transmission, in the grand scheme of things, is about to percent of the cost of delivered electricity. So, while we can talk about big numbers for transmission, that only looks at what it costs--there are--whenever you build a transmission line, there's a corresponding benefit. You have lower costs of dispatch, you have other benefits. So, transmission, in my view, is a good deal. Second, we have massively under built and maintained our transmission system in this country for the past to years, maybe --maybe approaching years. We have to build a lot of transmission. Even if you completely reject a renewable portfolio standard, we have to make substantial investments. The third point I would make is the impediments to building transmission are several. You mentioned siting and environmentally--just the whole siting issue. That is a big-- ``not in my backyard'' is a big issue. But, second is joint planning, the ability to look across States and to plan. Then, the third and most important is cost recovery. We're asking commissioners, like Commissioner Wright, to make decisions every day about building the national grid. It is an interstate highway system, and it's as if you were asking a commissioner in Pennsylvania to authorize the construction of an interstate highway going from, you know, New York to Detroit; it---- Senator Barrasso. Thank you. Mr. Furman [continuing]. Doesn't work. Senator Barrasso. Commissioner Wright. Mr. Wright. You raised some very good issues. You know, I-- one of the things that I've thought about, just--when they talked about, ``Well, South Carolina has possible wind off the coast.'' I mean, are we going to go off any lands, like Federal lands or anything like that? That would be a real issue. How does--how is that going to be addressed? I agree, I think your , lawsuits are low. I think there would be more than that. But, you know, again, I'm back to the State. I'm responsible for making sure that we have reliable, affordable power and that our utilities are able to do that at a profit that's regulated. So, I think--nationally, I think you do need to look at transmission; I think it's going to have to be something you've got to do. Senator Barrasso. Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones. Once again, I think if we allow all available renewables to participate, we can help take advantage of some of the existing resources and facilities, and hopefully somewhat offset the impact of new transmission. Senator Barrasso. OK. Mr. Lave. The analogy with the interstate highway is not a correct analogy. The interstate highway meant that I could get on the freeway in one part of Pittsburgh and get off it at another part of Pittsburgh. When we build a transmission line, it's from here to there. Right? It is directed at a particular place. It's not something that somebody else can get on and go. So, it's a piece of national infrastructure, but it's not like the interstate highway. Again, we had a Ph.D. thesis that was done, trying to take a look at whether--the difficulty with siting transmission. The answer is, there are--it is really difficult to site transmission. Under the legislation passed and years ago, Pennsylvania--most of Pennsylvania was designated as a national transmission corridor. You want to count the amount of transmission built in Pennsylvania, or approved? Right? That is that we've got a congressional delegation that's going to tell you, ``You're not going to build any damn transmission in Pennsylvania, thank you very much.'' I think that's going to be true. Then, just one other part of this, and that is, it is true that if we had a national market in these renewable standards, that the price would be pretty much equal across the Nation, but the price of electricity would not. In your home State, electricity would be really cheap. In southern California, it would be really expensive. I don't want to get into too much jargon, but there are things called ``locational marginal prices'' that depend on transmission costs, that depend on congestion. Those LMPs are really different between different areas. So, I think the result of this would be that, yes, South Carolina would have to pay cents a kilowatt hour for that, but it would be on top of a much higher price of electricity than you were paying in Wyoming. Senator Barrasso. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Dr. Lave had a wonderful article on the issues in Science and Technology, fall , called ``A National Renewable Portfolio Standard: Not Practical.''* I would commend it to the committee and ask that a copy of it be made a part of the record. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Article has been retained in committee files. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Chairman. We will include it in the record. Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. I think Senator Menendez was here at the beginning of the hearing, and he's come back, so perhaps we should let him ask questions. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Izzo, I know that the RPS that New Jersey has created has created hundreds of new jobs. But, if we institute a strong national renewable electricity standard, doesn't it have the potential to create thousands, or even tens of thousands, of new jobs in manufacturing, in installing wind turbines, solar panels, jobs boring holes for geothermal projects, jobs harvesting biomass, engineering, designing, all of these projects? So, when we balance, in terms of the costs, isn't this really a very strong job creator? Mr. Izzo. There's no doubt, Senator. You've hit upon all of the categories, as well. Obviously, we're most affected by the installation jobs, but there are manufacturing jobs. I know there have been some large announcements made by Vestas, in Colorado. The Senator mentioned some jobs that were coming to Michigan for blade manufacturing, and then the ensuing multiplier effects. But, you said it well. Senator Menendez. Let me ask you, States currently have an RPS policy in place, and many are much more aggressive than any of those being proposed federally. Do you agree that, if we were to pass any Federal standards, that States should retain the ability to have their own stronger targets? Mr. Izzo. Yes, without question. To that point, Senator Menendez, I will say that, in , percent of the renewable energy generation that was built in this country were in RPS States. So, RPS matters in encouraging renewable generation. Senator Menendez. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I wanted to get Dr. Izzo to agree with me twice so I could disagree with him once. [Laughter.] Senator Menendez. That is, I'd like to ask unanimous consent to introduce into the record a study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It's entitled ``The Treatment of Solar Electricity in Renewable Portfolio Standards.''* The study shows that States that had a specific carve-out for solar energy successfully created the construction of solar projects, while those without a carve-out did not lead to solar deployment. It seems to me, if we do not have a carve-out in this bill for other technologies, or a reverse carve-out limiting how much of a requirement can come from onshore wind, we will find ourselves, in , with only one mature renewable technology. It seems to me that we need a system that helps various--several mature technologies to be achieved in order to reach our collective goal. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Document has been retained in committee files. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, I'd ask unanimous consent to include that in the record. I think it's an important part, certainly, of the debate, as we move forward in figuring out how we have multiple renewable energy sources that can mature to both productivity and commercial deployment in a way that meets these goals. The Chairman. We will include that in the record. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Senator Burr. Senator Burr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you can see, there's tremendous interest in this subject and the need for extended hearings, I think, especially to have the administration here to tell us how they would implement a Federal RPS. So, I know, and I hope, that the chairman will have additional meetings. I'm sorry Senator Bayh left, because I did have the Duke Energy projections of what the RPS would cost for Indiana. I'm not sure if Duke's the sole supplier of power there. It's $ million over years. Of course, under this proposal, the costs would extend to . For North Carolina, the percent that Duke covers would be $ . billion. For South Carolina, Commissioner Wright, $ million just for the Duke portion. I might add that those numbers, for North Carolina, do not include the cost--does not take into account the ``renewable mandate in North Carolina'' cost. So, it's far going to exceed that, before we've actually paid for the power. Let me turn to you, Commissioner Wright, if I could. We've already discussed that North Carolina is the only southeastern State with a renewable portfolio standard, and a half percent. How would this Federal program, in your estimation, affect North Carolina and its ratepayers? Mr. Wright. Those things that are qualified under North Carolina's RPS may not be the same as what is in the standard that we're talking about here today. I haven't looked at the detail, specifically, of the RPS in North Carolina to know what's covered and what's not. In North Carolina, the -and-a- half percent--I believe percent of that -and-a-half can come from energy efficiency, which, I think, you do the math, it's--that's percent. So, that's the same as what's in the RPS we're talking, today. But, you know, every State is going to be different. Those that have RPSs, they're not the same as what we're talking about in this particular proposal today. So, it will affect States. It's going to be costly to them---- Senator Burr. Yes. Mr. Wright [continuing]. Especially in my region. Senator Burr. Mr. Furman, if I understood what you provide in the wind generation, you're proposing that you should get a renewable--there should be a renewable electricity credit that's traded. If South Carolina needed additional renewables to meet their portfolio standard, they would pay you for that credit. In addition to that, the power you generated, you are selling, so you're getting money because you're providing him a credit, and you're producing power that you're selling. Do I understand it correctly? Mr. Furman. That's true. Senator Burr. I encourage you to get with General Motors, because they cannot figure out how to make money. [Laughter.] Senator Burr. If they could figure out how to provide a picture to people that would like to buy a Suburban, but, because of fuel efficiency standards, are buying a hybrid, then--and they could make money by selling the picture and money by selling the hybrid, I'm sure that they could figure out how to make money and compete against the Japanese. But, I'm not sure that--unless we give you the honeypot of people paying something for nothing, except to meet this arbitrary number that we've set--not one that's set by our State, one that we have applied a one-size-fits-all across the country and said, ``Doesn't matter whether, geographically, you can take advantage of anything, we'll give you the ability to buy this credit so everybody hits it, but we're not going to pay any attention to how much that costs you or how much money you export.'' It's a great business model. I commend you for it. I'm just not sure that I want to be a participant in something that accomplishes a good feeling, but not an effective cost for the ratepayers in the States that don't have the benefit. Now, we've looked at the trading that goes on with carbon trading in Europe. I'm sure it has its supporters and its detractors. I want to look at how they've cleaned up their emissions. It hasn't cleaned up very much. There's a lot of money trading hands. At some point, we've got to get focused on the outcome, and that's, Are we improving the emission standards in this country? Now, let me just turn to you, Dr. Lave, for second. Your full testimony had much more about nuclear. I'm in agreement with you on that. One specific question. Should nuclear be considered a renewable for the purposes of us considering this legislation? Mr. Lave. Senator, I would never answer a question like that. [Laughter.] Mr. Lave. I think that we have enough uranium so that we can generate a tremendous amount of nuclear power for now and the future. Whether it is strictly renewable, in the sense of going on forever, I think that's not true. But, if you were looking at a century, or more than a century, there's certainly enough uranium so that we could generate nuclear power---- Senator Burr. If we adopted reprocessing in this country, we could--instead of storing percent, using percent, we could use percent and store percent, which is, hopefully, the conclusion that the study will come to. I think you raised a very good point; we haven't built a nuclear plant in some time, we don't know what the cost is. I would sort of go back to where Senator Dorgan was. The fact that we haven't proceeded forward is because we haven't had a comprehensive blueprint of energy policy for the future. I wish we could focus on that comprehensive energy blueprint first, and figure out what that is and how all these pieces fit, before we start creating the pieces. We may find out they don't fit in the comprehensive energy policy that's in the best interests of the country, both from a standpoint of security and from a standpoint of cost-effectiveness. I thank the chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Next is Senator Landrieu, and then we have Senator Cantwell and Senator Shaheen and Senator Lincoln. We're supposed to have a vote at o'clock. So, we'll just keep going. Senator Landrieu. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to begin by associating myself with remarks of the Senator from Tennessee, in a broad way, that I do hope that, as we begin this debate, we can begin with a more unifying call than something that could potentially, you know, divide our country. I want to say how strongly I agree with him that, in my years in the Senate, I have not seen the country more ready to embark in a new direction, but it has to be a direction that makes sense to them, with clear and defined goals. I'd like to start, Mr. Chairman, with a visual that might help us understand the challenges of what we're talking about when we talk about wind. The latest generation of windmills, using the most modern technology and construction material, are almost meters in diameter, they stretch higher than a - story building, which is about half the size of the Eiffel Tower. A windmill produces megawatt of power when the wind is blowing at a relatively high speed of meters per second. It would require of these windmills to produce the equivalent power of one nuclear power plant, and it would take , acres, one wind farm, which is square miles. By way of comparison, Washington, DC., is only square miles. So, I just want to repeat that. Wind is very attractive. I'm attracted to it. Most Americans are. Solar is very attractive. But, there are some significant and real challenges with wind. Land and space is just one of them. The other challenge is a poster that I want to--and aesthetics, may I say--the other challenge is represented by this poster. In the Southeast, where I'm from, Louisiana, we don't have much wind at all. Now, we're blessed with a lot of oil and gas, and we have nuclear power, significantly, here, and hopefully more. But, we virtually have no wind. We might have some, offshore. That is exciting. We may have some tidal energy, as well, which is in its infancy stages of development. But, we virtually have no wind compared to the other parts of the country. I also want to hold up a visual about solar. While we think we have a lot of sun, and it tends to be hot in Louisiana, we don't have the same resources of sun and geothermal in the Southeast. Which brings me to the goal of what I think we should be achieving or looking at, is where most Americans are; they're excited about the possibility of being clean--not just renewable, but clean--and secure. If there was any feeling of the last election, it was that America has an opportunity to be secure. If we address this in a broad way, sensitive to regions, I think we might be able to achieve some significant advancement. I'm not sure that this particular bill is the way to get there. Let me ask a question, to anyone who would care to answer it. This is a Louisiana ratepayer's question. Under the proposal that we have before us, that, in my view, puts too much of an emphasis on wind and solar, not enough emphasis on regional choices and menus that make sense, our ratepayers--let me try to understand--would have to purchase large amounts of renewable energy credits, primarily from solar and wind; but, once they do that, is it not true that they still need to generate power? We'll still buy our power from traditional sources--coal, gas, and nuclear? So, aren't we asking, Mr. Furman and Dr. Izzo, that our ratepayers, like other States, would have to pay twice? We'd have to be buying the power for renewables, and then also paying the regular rates to maintain the current infrastructure that we have now, because it's not going to go away. Mr. Furman. Senator, no, I don't believe that's true. Let me hold up a--it's small, but let me hold up--one thing that is being missed in this entire debate is the massive biomass resource that exists in the Southeast and the Upper Midwest. This picture is from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and it shows the biomass potential that could be delivered. So, anybody in Louisiana, any utility ratepayer in Louisiana, would have the option of either buying a credit from anywhere--the Upper Midwest--or developing, within the service territory, a biomass facility. Now, some--a lot has been made about how expensive this was. Senator Burr made reference to General Motors. The fact of the matter is, this is all going to be market-driven. We will-- the benefit of this approach to a renewable energy policy is that the market will be free to deliver the least expensive option. So, yes, we will still need to be buying and consuming electricity, just from the grid, but this provides a way for the Nation, as a whole, to move its consumption of electricity toward renewables, reducing demand---- Senator Landrieu. But, Mr. Furman, do you agree with Mr. Jones that, under the current law that we are reviewing right now, the current draft, that the biomass definition--or do you say, Mr. Jones, the wood products--is not as clear as it could be. I don't disagree that we have a lot of forests in the Southeast, we also have the opportunity for biofuels. But, it's the approach that we take. We are very excited about the nuclear--expansion of nuclear. So, I think that we have to take that into consideration. But, I want to get this on the record. Do you agree that it would take of these giant windmills to produce the same power as one nuclear power plant? Do you agree that it would take , acres, or square miles? Mr. Furman. I do not. Senator Landrieu. OK. Mr. Furman [continuing]. If I could clarify why. I think the numbers that you gave, Senator, were a -meter tower and a -megawatt wind turbine. In fact, a -meter tower is going to be a - or a -megawatt wind turbine. So, we're typically seeing , megawatts--if you want---- Senator Landrieu. So, instead of square miles, it would be two-thirds of that? Mr. Furman. It would be less. It would be---- Senator Landrieu. A half. Mr. Furman [continuing]. Significantly less. I think the-- the other thing that is interesting about how you look at wind---- Senator Landrieu. Which would be about the whole size of Washington, DC., not twice the size. Mr. Furman. Yes. Senator Landrieu. It would be the whole size of Washington, DC. Let me just end with this, Mr. Chairman. As a Senator who's represented oil and gas, which is tough these days, I have to hear my colleagues say to me, ``We don't want an oil and gas facility anywhere near us.'' Now, I think they look pretty nice, particularly at night. It looks like a Christmas tree to me out in the Gulf. But, you know, I can appreciate that they don't want to look at it. How are we going to get them to look at these windmills, acres and acres and acres, mile after mile after mile? I mean, I don't think they're ugly, but I don't say they're any prettier than oil and gas fabrication facilities. So, until someone really gets a handle on what the landscape of this country is going to look like if we are so determined to upstart a wind industry, as opposed to trying to make America clean and energy-secure, I think that we have to adjust our direction here. Thank you. The Chairman. Senator Cantwell. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for your testimony. I've listened with interest to my colleagues making various statements. I guess I look at this issue a little differently, considering the excitement around distributed generation. Just like the change from mainframe computers to computers on a desk, the same efficiency now can come from distributed generation, as from centralized power plants and that is bringing the source of energy closer to those that use it. It's more cost- effective. In that, I also think that we are missing some of the issues about hidden costs. I mean, everybody always looks at the cost of CO , and we haven't quite put the price tag on that here, legislatively. But, there are other issues. I am thinking, Mr. Furman, of your testimony, particularly as it relates to natural gas. Farmers in Washington State almost went out of business over the price spike in natural gas in recent years. We cannot continue to have natural gas go up to $ on whatever it was, and think that we're going to survive. The electricity grid, with percent of its power generated from coal and a big chunk of it from natural gas, as you pointed out, would benefit from a renewable portfolio standard that would allow us to diversity our fuel mix. Would it actually reduce the cost of natural gas by percent as the report says? Is that right, Mr. Furman? Mr. Furman. Yes. Senator Cantwell. So, that's a big advantage. That's a big advantage to farmers all across America, if we can keep down the cost of fertilizer. These pressures are going to continue to grow. So, I think we have to include all the costs. But, I do have another question. Mr. Jones, we tried very hard, here in the United States Senate, to have our language on ``sustainable woody biomass'' prevail in the bill. We weren't successful with the House in doing that, but we'll go back and we'll try again. But, my question is, given the current state of PTC-ITC lack of credit flow, and given this discussion about RES, is it possible to look at ways to make those regional projects more cost-effective? We've been battering around loan-guarantee concepts between the House and the Senate. Should we be looking at meeting the RES standard with further incentives from the government, something like low-interest loans amortized, maybe over years, with, perhaps Fed rate--near zero--that would help, actually realize the cost-effectiveness for the ratepayers of these projects in some of these regions? Mr. Furman. Senator, if I could answer--there's no question that all of those programs help, and particularly--you know, our current problem is--the whole system of incentivization for renewables has sort of broken down with the collapse of Wall Street, and we're unable to monetize any of this. You know, most of that benefit, if not all of it, does flow back to consumers in the pricing that we provide to utilities. Loan guarantees, I think, are, you know, definitely a help, not just in incentivizing, but also in helping us to get through this short-term problem that we have with the collapse of the markets. But, I think that, in terms of regional differences, which is what you were, I think, alluding to---- Senator Cantwell. For the Northwest, with percent hydro and on the way for other renewables, yes, those are easier challenges to meet. But, maybe part of RES is the ability to get access to capital at a low rate to help drive down the cost of some of these implementations. Mr. Furman. There's no question that would help. Senator Cantwell. Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones. I would say, in the current writing of the definition, the issue we're hearing from power companies that are looking to my members to--as a resource in the Southeast who are about to build biomass facilities, the issue they have now is, Will landowners survive long enough in order to provide that resource? The way the definition is written right now, it's hard to site an energy facility and say, ``Where can we put this energy facility where we know we'll have a guaranteed supply of wood?'' That's stopping the financing of these facilities, because the financing of these facilities are-- they're saying, ``Can you guarantee a supply of wood years from now?'' With the current market situation and where we're going, that's tough to say. The way the definition is written is a further constraint, because it's putting very narrow boundaries on the amount of available wood that can be there, when we have a lot of wood, but only a certain amount can be utilized. So, I would say, by broadening the definition, we can definitely, hopefully, free up some incentives for these facilities to come in and make the banks a little more willing to make loans to their startup. Senator Cantwell. The language that we had about ``sustainable woody biomass,'' that met the test? Mr. Jones. I think when we talk about sustainability, we're looking more at the forest health, so I think we could be broader and just say that, you know, we just have ``all woody biomass,'' that includes all plants and trees, and that would help meet the test. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Lave, I'm informed that you need to leave to catch a flight. We appreciate you being here, and we certainly excuse you. Senator Shaheen. Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, to all of the panelists. I certainly agree with several of you who have talked about the need to move this country in a new energy direction that uses more clean energy technologies and that that's not only an environmental imperative and a national security imperative, it's also an economic imperative. I think that a renewable portfolio standard could be essential to doing that. Two years ago in New Hampshire, we enacted an aggressive renewable portfolio standard law that requires all utilities, as well as competitive suppliers, to produce . percent of their power from renewable sources by . Now, one of the reasons that we require competitive suppliers to do it is because, when I was Governor, New Hampshire restructured its electric industry to make generation of power a competitive function. I'm sorry Dr. Lave is gone, because one of the reasons we got to that point was because we built the last licensed nuclear power plant in the country in Seabrook. That gave us the highest average electric rates in the country. So, trying to get to a more competitive power supply was important. But, my question really is--and, Dr. Izzo, I would ask you if you would take a crack at this first--should a national renewable electricity standard apply to competitive suppliers, in addition to utilities? Then, should it also apply to all utilities? In New Hampshire, we have a number of municipal utilities; they don't generate million megawatt hours a year. But, should an RES or an RPS apply to everybody? Mr. Izzo. The answer to that is yes. The way we do that in New Jersey is, we make it the burden of what we call the load- serving entity, the company that owns the meter and the wire into the home. So, when they require it of the supplier, the regulator typically allows them to pass the higher costs from the supplier--because it is higher cost--to their customer. It works seamlessly. But, the short answer to your question is, yes, it should apply to everyone. Senator Shaheen. Can you talk a little bit about what you think the consequences might be, if any, of not having it applied to everyone? Mr. Izzo. Besides the inconsistency, I mean, a ton of carbon, whether it's emitted by a utility-owned generation plant or whether it's owned by a competitive power plant or whether it's owned by a municipal co-op or whether it's owned by an IOU, is still a ton of carbon. Once again, if we are going to give birth to some nascent industries here, whether that's onshore wind, offshore wind, biomass, solar, the economies of scale matter. So, why chip away at that? We're talking about percent of the percent. We have a lot of work to do here. Senator Shaheen. Thank you. The Chairman. Senator Lincoln. Senator Lincoln. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I'd note that the women have been hanging in here with you at the end. [Laughter.] The Chairman. The women are the stalwarts of this committee, I agree. [Laughter.] Senator Lincoln. We're hanging in there with you. We want to thank, certainly, the chairman for bringing us together on this issue, and getting started on this debate and trying to figure out the solutions to the challenges that we face. We thank you all for bringing your expertise to our area of renewable energy. Just a couple of questions. You know, I think we all agree that we need to take steps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We need to encourage technology that's going to be maximize the renewable resources available to us. But, I do think that it's important for us to ask questions about how any standards we do set will ensure equity among the various regions of our country. You've heard that from so many of us. We come from all different parts of this great nation. We all feel like we have a tremendous amount to give, in terms of contributions to solving this problem ut, we also feel very strongly that we need to be recognized for the strengths that we have, and not punished because of the weaknesses that might exist in our areas. In Arkansas, I'm extremely proud. We're contributing to the supply chain for wind energy by manufacturing the blades and the turbines. But, as Senator Landrieu showed you in that map, we don't produce a whole heck of a lot of wind, except for those of us that talk a lot. [Laughter.] Senator Lincoln. It is a critical part of making sure that we are allowed to make our contribution to the solution. Arkansas has great potential to contribute to a new energy economy through biomass supply, not only in terms of--I think, Mr. Jones, you mentioned the broad definition, in terms of what the forest landowners and others can contribute--but agricultural waste, animal waste, there's a whole host of different things that we can do in different regions, but it has to be recognized as a contribution in helping to solve that problem, and I hope we will. One of the things that hasn't been talked about an awful lot today, and I would like to just bring up, and that is the hydropower. In the current RES draft, the hydropower is excluded from the base amount from which the percentages are calculated. I've never really understood why existing hydro, in this debate, is not given more credit as a renewable energy source. It's something age-old that, for eons, civilization has used as a power source. Any of you all want to try to give somebody like me an explanation of why you think hydro is not talked about more often? Mr. Furman. Senator, if I could take that on. The goal here is not to recognize, necessarily, existing resources, it's to reduce carbon, it's to, you know, create jobs and economic development, and it's to reduce our dependence on foreign imports, now or in the future. If we could do that, we could recognize existing hydro. I think that, in order to accomplish those three goals, though, you would have to raise the numbers in the RPS, in terms of the targets. Senator Lincoln. What if you take it away? Mr. Furman. I'm sorry. Senator Lincoln. What if you eliminate it? Mr. Furman. Eliminate hydro? Senator Lincoln. Uh-huh. Mr. Furman. We---- Senator Lincoln. Existing hydro. Does that not set you back, in terms of what you're trying to accomplish? Mr. Furman. This legislation won't do that, though. The existing hydro will continue to operate, just as the existing coal and the existing nuclear will continue to operate. Senator Lincoln. But, in terms of what you're saying, the contribution of carbon--I mean, obviously, that doesn't exist with hydro. In terms of, you know, taking that away as a source of power that exists today, you're going to have to replace it. I don't understand why it's not counted as something that is basically neutral, in terms of the environment. Mr. Furman. To be clear, we're not taking away the hydro. All we're saying is, going forward---- Senator Lincoln. You're not going to count it. Mr. Furman [continuing]. You have to add new renewables into your portfolio. Senator Lincoln. Uh-huh. Mr. Furman. So, it will continue to operate. We're not going to take it away. We're not going to even dis-incentivize anybody from continuing to operate it. These plants are among our least expensive resources in the country for providing power, and I don't expect them ever to stop operating. Senator Lincoln. If you quit supporting them, they will. Mr. Furman. No, they'll still be paid for by the market and by ratepayers. They will still be in the rate base, they will-- Bonneville Power Administration will continue to generate and sell that power to the marketplace, and it will be very cost- effective. Senator Lincoln. I guess I tend to agree--disagree with you, in the sense that, you know, when you don't support things that, I think, are productive, then point in fact is, people are not going to use 'them. If it's going to be a part of how credits are traded and how people are evaluated, in terms of what they produce, particularly regionally, then it's going to become less and less of a viable source. People are not going to make the investment. I know, certainly, in terms of hydro facilities that exist today, it becomes harder and harder here to be able to find the resources to make the repairs in, you know, hydro projects that have been very, very successful and productive over the years. Yet, you know, being able to make the investment in the infrastructure for turbines and other things that need to be replaced or reworked becomes virtually impossible, and so, then you just lose that power. Maybe we'll just have to disagree on that one. It seems---- Mr. Furman. I think we will. Senator Lincoln [continuing]. Seems like--it seems like--as I said, for eons it's been a great resource for mankind, something that we probably should continue to focus on. Mr. Jones, in the South, and certainly in Arkansas, the use of biomass as a renewable energy, I think, must be utilized as much as we can in order to meet any future RES standard that's going to happen. There's an abundance of forest resources and infrastructure for the potential to process our forest biomass for energy use. You were concerned, I think, about the current definition of ``renewable biomass.'' You've touched a little bit on that. I know you mentioned to Senator Landrieu, there-- do you--anything else there that we need to be aware of? Mr. Jones. Yes. The current definition that's being proposed in this piece of legislation really takes an agricultural or seasonal-crop approach to a long-term investment, like trees, which won't apply. Senator Lincoln. Right. Mr. Jones. Basically, it's a closed-loop approach, which is very difficult for a long-term investment, like growing a stand of trees, to participate in. So, not only are we talking about excluding natural forests, but we're also taking the wrong approach to allowing them to participate. Senator Lincoln. Do you believe it's possible for States in the South to meet a strict renewable electricity standard if forests are restricted from being used to meet the standard? Mr. Jones. I don't think so. We've talked about the regional differences, and Senator Landrieu's maps showed it very well and very clearly, that we do have some resource restrictions when it comes to wind and solar, but we do not have those restrictions when it comes to biomass resources in the South. You were correct to say that some ag products and animal waste products go in there, as well. But, we have an abundance of forest resources in the southeastern United States that currently are losing their markets, the mills aren't located where everybody can access them now. These energy markets have the potential to set up right there, take a low- cost--basically take small trees--these are small trees that are being cleared out for--to increase forest health and manage for a higher-value product, and also the byproducts of saw- milling and waste from these manufacturing facilities. So, it goes to help, not only landowners, but the manufacturing facilities that we have, and preserve some of the jobs that are currently being lost---- Senator Lincoln. Certainly---- Mr. Jones [continuing]. Through the reduction of industry. Senator Lincoln. Certainly one of the issues there is making sure there's parity, in terms of incentivizing these types of fuel uses, as well. So, that's important. Mr. Chairman, I'd just also like to add my comments, that some of the other--my colleagues made, in terms of nuclear. Arkansas has been very successful, because it has been a diverse State, where it has used diverse power, whether it's been woody biomass, whether it is nuclear, whether it's hydro, whether it's coal, natural gas--we've tried to be--I think, set an example, in terms of what needs to happen. I would just echo the comments of some of my colleagues, where we're not going to get from where we need to be unless we ensure that we're going to be looking at all of the resources that we have, certainly looking at them in a correct way, making sure that we're using the most efficient and effective ways that we possibly can, but making sure that we are recognizing all of the resources that exist before us. So, I hope we will, and particularly in terms of nuclear. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Thanks, to all of you, for testifying. I think it's been a very good hearing, and we appreciate it. We will proceed to consider this further in the future. [Whereupon, at : p.m., the hearing was adjourned.] APPENDIXES ---------- Appendix I Responses to Additional Questions ---------- Responses of David A. Wright to Questions From Senator Bingaman Question . Does the inclusion of energy efficiency help? Answer. Yes. Energy efficiency should be included in any discussion about the need for clean energy. Energy efficiency reduces the need for generation and should be considered as a substitute for renewable generation in a RPS for areas where renewable resources may be limited. It certainly should be included in any federal mandate for certain mixes of energy sources. It should count as any other source and it should not be constrained by bureaucratic hurdles that do not apply to other energy sources (i.e. requiring a Governor to petition for its use) nor should its use be capped in counting towards compliance with a federal standard. While including energy efficiency will help mitigate the cost impact for Southeastern consumers, it will not eliminate the potentially significant cost of compliance with a Federal RPS. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``If the overall intention of energy efficiency is to reduce emissions, then the effect of energy efficiency is the same as the production of zero-emission energy. The inclusion of energy efficiency is therefore vital to this discussion. However, it is also vital to appropriately and reasonably address the notion of minimum or maximum energy efficiency requirements. Because of regional variations in energy efficiency opportunity, states (and the utilities that serve them) should be given sufficient latitude to determine the kind and amount of energy efficiency measures to implement in their respective jurisdictions.'' Question . I have been troubled that energy efficiency credits may differ in value from program to program and from state to state. Should such credits be tradeable like renewables credits? Should they be limited to use for compliance only within the state that has petitioned for the right to use efficiency credits? Answer. While each state has different avoided costs which impact the monetary ``value'' of an avoided MW or MWh, the same is true for renewable generation. If Renewable Energy Credits are tradable so should be Energy Efficiency Credits. Energy efficiency should count like any other energy source toward meeting a federal renewables mandate. Accounting issues will exist with all fuel and energy sources and therefore trading of efficiency credits should not be constrained anymore than those for wind, solar, etc. My thought is that energy efficiency credits that are tradeable from state to state would create a situation where the benefits of the efficiency improvements are seen in one state and paid for by another. These benefits would include not only lower emissions but decreased need for new generation. My initial thought is that energy efficiency credits, if used as a substitute for renewables, should be created and remain within each state. However, a cost/benefit analysis should be performed to consider the cost of an allowance created within the state versus outside of the state along with the impact on generation needs, emissions and lost revenues. (A comment in response to this question from the North Carolina Utilities Commission): ``If a national market is created for renewable energy RECs, then it might not be inappropriate to allow a national market for energy efficiency RECs in order to reduce to the greatest extent possible the cost of compliance with a federal RPS.'' Responses of David A. Wright to Questions From Senator Murkowski Question . How much back up power from conventional power plants is needed to meet a % RPS requirement by ? At what cost? Answer. This will depend on what mix of renewable resources are used to meet the RPS. If all the resources are biomass, then very little conventional power plants are needed. If all resources are wind or solar, then anywhere from % to % back up is needed due to the unpredictability of the resource. The cost of the backup, based on adding simple cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbines to provide the needed reliability, would be approximately $ - /kW installed (in dollars). The need for this much backup generation will most likely be met through some combination of natural gas-fired intermediate and peaking type facilities. Most of the renewable resources defined by the majority draft RPS that would count toward compliance are intermittent in their generation output and have low capacity factors. A recent study titled the ``Joint Coordinated System Plan'' (JCSP) was released by the Midwest ISO, PJM, MAPP, the Southwest Power Pool and TVA. It confirmed that wind generation has a capacity factor of %, requiring backup generation for the remaining % of power needs. Solar generation's capacity factor is typically even lower. This backup generation would almost always be natural gas-fired combustion turbines or combined cycle units. This JCSP study examined the impacts of the eastern U.S. getting %, % and % of its electricity from wind. The study shows that to meet the demand for energy in the Eastern Interconnection from -- with % wind would require the installation or import of , MW of wind capacity while the amount to meet a % wind requirement would require some , MW of wind. (At MW each, this level would require the installation of , windmills.) The study also shows that each of these levels would also require the installation of substantial amounts of natural gas-fired capacity above the base case. The % wind scenario would result in the need for , MW of natural gas capacity above the base case, and the % wind scenario would require , MW of natural gas capacity. Using EIA cost estimates for gas fired capacity, both wind scenarios would require tens of billions of dollars of capital investment above and beyond the costs of the renewable capacity. Without significant improvement in storage technology, intermittent renewable generation resources, such as wind and solar, are not suitable to replace conventional base load generation resources. Question . Do you agree that as it now stands, our country's transmission infrastructure is woefully inadequate to achieve a % by RPS requirement? Answer. Speaking nationally, you may be correct when you say that our current transmission infrastructure is inadequate to support the amount of new renewable energy that is currently being contemplated. Without the necessary upgrades, the reliability of our nation's transmission grid will constantly be a concern. Similar to what we saw recently in Texas when the availability of wind generated electricity suddenly dropped in a matter of minutes, operators will continually be on heightened alert to ensure a constant and steady supply of electricity generated from renewable resources, as well as back-up capacity, is available. The same is not the case in the Carolinas, however. While the grid may not currently be constructed to wheel power from remote, unpopulated locations in some parts of the country where there is a great wind potential, it is adequate to handle biomass and distributed generation, e.g., solar, without major upgrades. In the Carolinas, much of the wind potential can also be accommodated without major upgrades. The grid was never intended to deliver offshore wind power or wave/ tidal power, but even these sources may be delivered once the infrastructure is added to get the power on shore. The existing grid is highly reliable and serves its intended purpose of delivering the most economic sources of energy to customers. The impact of renewable resources should be addressed on a local or regional basis, rather than attempting to overhaul the entire system. Question . What are the estimated infrastructure costs to meet the legislation's requirement? How realistic is it to get the necessary transmission in place in time to meet the hard and fast deadlines of the national mandate? Should Congress build some flexibility into the program if inadequate transmission prevents compliance? Answer. Yes, flexibility should be built into the program if transmission capacity limits renewable resource availability within individual states and to account for disparities in the amount of renewable resources available within a given state. The JCSP study cited above examined two different resource and transmission paths to serve a total of , MW of coincident peak load in the Eastern Interconnection (except Florida) in . The Reference Scenario, which assumes that present RPS requirements are met with local on-shore wind resources, would add , miles of new extra high voltage transmission at an assumed cost of approximately $ billion. With percent of the Interconnection's energy coming from wind and percent from base load steam generation, total energy production costs in would equal $ billion and total generation capital costs would equal $ billion. In contrast, the percent Wind Energy Scenario, which assumes a percent national RPS requirement such as proposed in the majority draft, would add , miles of new EHV transmission at an assumed cost of approximately $ billion if met by U.S. on-shore wind development,. Under this scenario, energy production costs in would equal $ billion and the capital cost of new generation would equal $ , billion. These results should be viewed as illustrative or ``ballpark'' costs rather than definitive findings about the costs of new transmission and generation related to either the status quo expansion path or a high-renewables scenario. Even with that caveat, the findings suggest that transmission overlays should be strongly considered as a way to improve the future reliability and economics of the nation's bulk power electric system under either policy path. Siting new transmission infrastructure is a contentious issue that needs to be addressed. If new transmission is not available, it will not matter how much renewable energy is produced because that energy will not be available for delivery. In that case, Congress needs to ensure that states and consumers are not unfairly penalized for something beyond their control. (Comments in response to this question from the North Carolina Utilities Commission): ``We have no estimates about infrastructure costs to meet the proposed federal RPS. Although the development of renewable resources in other regions has created a backlog of transmission interconnection requests, we believe that we have adequate transmission planned or in place in North Carolina to meet our REPS requirement ( . % by , up to % of which can be met with energy efficiency savings) with in- state or regional generation resources.'' Question . Given the different goals and definitions of renewable energy in the various state renewable energy standard programs, how does the majority staff draft ensure consistency and coordination of the state and federal programs? Answer. There is general consensus that the following resources are considered renewable: solar photovoltaic; solar thermal; wind; biomass; wave and ocean current. However the draft program does not recognize the useful thermal energy created from a combined heat and power system using a renewable resource, such as biomass. While the majority staff draft does recognize the ability of states to have their own RES programs it does nothing to ensure consistency and coordination. In fact, if a state has an RES program that is in any way different than the majority draft, then a utility in that state will have to comply with both the state and federal requirement. Currently some states have RES programs and almost all are different in some respect than the majority draft either in the definition of what qualifies as ``renewable'', in percentage requirements, the level of alternative compliance payments or in the timelines for achieving levels of renewable energy. Each utility will be forced to comply with both state and federal requirements even if different. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``The majority staff draft should recognize the unequal distribution of renewable resource potential as well as the unequal distribution of load obligations throughout the country. Areas of low renewable potential and high electrical demand are inherently disadvantaged by nature of their resource allotment and the incumbent economic base in their area. One size will not fit all.'' (Comments in response to this question from the North Carolina Utilities Commission): ``It purports to require coordination, but doesn't practically do anything to ensure consistency and coordination of the federal and state programs. It includes its own definition of renewable resources that may or may not coincide with a particular state's definitions. It gives no credit for renewable generation that may be allowed in a state but not in the federal definition. We have seen drafts [the House draft, we believe] that are more limiting in the definition of biomass, for example, such as limiting forestry residues to biomass on federal lands. Some drafts do not include non-electric energy production such as solar thermal and waste heat recovery, both of which are included in the North Carolina REPS.'' Question . Do you agree that any federal RPS program must account for the regional variations in the supply of renewable resources? Answer. Yes. All states do not have the same amounts or levels of renewable resources as defined in the majority draft. Therefore, unless these innate differences are recognized, if a penalty kWh charge is levied for non-compliance, or out of state RECs must be purchased to satisfy the requirement, all that is being accomplished is a wealth transfer. Even when regions have native resources (i.e., solar in the west, wind in the mid-west, biomass in the Southeast) it makes no sense to establish one standard for each region's resources. Any federal mandate for energy sources must allow a region to take into account the resources that economically exist in that region. Otherwise utility customers are merely making payments for RECs or alternative compliance payments that don't return any value to those same customers. As I mentioned in my appearance before the Committee, a more logical approach to a federal mandate than the majority draft would be to require each state to adopt an RPS that is consistent with the energy resources available in that state or region. That would make more sense for the energy needs and utility ratepayers of that region. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``Yes. If regional variations are not considered, then the government would in effect be promoting economic discrimination in the name of promoting renewable energy.'' (Comments in response to this question from the North Carolina Utilities Commission): ``Any federal RPS program must absolutely account for regional variations in the supply of renewable resources. While a federal RPS may ignore state boundaries with regard to compliance, it must respect the decisions of states which enact their own RPS to encourage development of indigenous renewable resources.'' Question . I know you're concerned that the Southeast is penalized under a national program because the region lacks sufficient wind or solar power. Proponents of a federal mandate, however, insist that the Southeast can meet the new requirement through the use of biomass. How do you respond? Answer. Biomass is a resource available in the Southeast, but its use to generate % of retail sales is not practical. Those who say the Southeast can comply with a RPS with biomass greatly underestimate the amount of energy needed to provide % of retail sales, and they overestimate the ability of biomass to meet the requirements. For one thing, much of the biomass technology is currently in the research and development stage, and not commercially proven as to operation or cost. In addition, an estimate for the area of the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) shows that for the utilities in the region to meet a % RPS with biomass would require some , MW of biomass generating capacity. To fuel that capacity would require the annual collection, transport and burning of almost million tons a year of biomass. To grow that much biomass would require tens of millions of acres of land to be able to plant and harvest that many tons on an annual basis. Such a commitment of land would not be practical and the planting, harvesting and transport of such an amount would have tremendous impacts of its own. The December La Capra study, Analysis of a Renewable Portfolio Standard for the State of North Carolina, found that North Carolina could only achieve about % energy of its energy needs from biomass (including wood and agricultural waste, landfill gas and animal waste) by . In Florida, the Navigant study, Florida Renewable Energy Potential Assessment, showed that biomass (existing and new, but excluding MSW, which does not qualify under the federal proposals) could only provide up to or . % of the state's energy requirement by in the most favorable circumstances. In South Carolina, the La Capra study estimated practical biomass potential to be about %. Speaking specifically of the concerns I have heard from the state of Georgia, while biomass is Georgia's best source of renewable energy, it is also limited. Plant size is generally limited to less than MWs, with fuel supplies coming from within miles of the plant. Building to MWs of biomass in Georgia may not be possible due to limits on fuel supply. A study of the maximum biomass potential in Georgia needs to be considered. Competition for fuel sources between plants and with the pulp, paper and timber industry may drive prices higher and may push industry out of the state. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``This statement fails to consider the dangers of over utilization of biomass and the corresponding impacts to those interests that already rely on these resources. Alabama, for example, does have substantial biomass resources that could be used for electricity generation. However, to fully meet the Federally mandated RPS requirements using biomass could require as much as % of the state's commercial pine forest lands (roughly . million acres or sq miles). If Alabama generators attempted to meet the RPS requirement with biomass alone, it would mean: Wood prices in the South would rise enormously, just as the price of corn did when this crop was converted from a food crop to an ethanol crop. Pulp and paper making in Alabama, and across the South, would be severely threatened, potentially costing thousands of jobs. The cost of electricity would rise, imposing added costs on families and businesses. Rising costs on businesses would, in turn, eliminate more jobs in the region. Rising cost of electricity would put the state and the region at a considerable disadvantage in attracting new industry because other sections of the country, blessed with abundant solar and wind resources, would not experience the same increases in costs.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``No, we do not believe that North Carolina can meet the proposed federal RPS standard solely through the use of biomass. North Carolina adopted an aggressive REPS given the potential for renewable energy development, including biomass, in the State. This also includes a significant amount of wind energy development and an allowance for energy savings from the implementation of energy efficiency measures. Even so, the North Carolina REPS requirement increases only to . % ( % of which can be from energy efficiency)--far less than the - % proposed in drafts of federal legislation. As a part of its REPS, North Carolina allows utilities to purchase renewable energy RECs from out- of-state to meet up to % of their REPS requirement. We expect that utilities will take advantage of this provision both for resource availability and cost considerations.'' Question . Some dismiss the argument that the RPS will result in a wealth transfer from areas of the country that lack renewable resources to those that are blessed with them. As a state regulator, can you explain why you believe a federal mandate will result in increased rates for those in the Southeast? Answer. The cost of energy produced by the limited renewable resources in the Southeast is two to three times greater than the cost of energy produced from traditional sources. Requiring the use of the higher-cost renewable resources will increase the cost of power, which will be recovered through rates paid by consumers. In addition, many renewable resources such as wind and solar are intermittent and therefore some amount of traditional capacity must be available to backup these resources which will add additional cost. Another option is to purchase RECs. But if a utility must purchase RECs to satisfy a federal RPS and does not also get the kWhs of energy they represent, it basically is paying twice for the energy needed to meet its customers? needs. If it also receives the kWhs, it will be paying a premium for such RECs and kWhs, thus driving up the price of electricity for that state. According to the draft proposal, excluding energy efficiency, there are essentially three ways for a utility and its consumers to comply with the renewable portion of the mandate: ( ) build or contract for renewable energy to be delivered to electricity consumers served by the utility; ( ) buy a renewable energy credit (REC) from designated renewables placed in service after January , ; and/or ( ) pay an alternative compliance payment (ACP) of . cents per KWh. Unlike other areas of the country, the Southeast is not blessed with enough available resources for all the utilities to build or contract for the amount of renewable generation that each of them will be required to supply to their consumers under the majority's draft proposal. While many supporters cite the availability of biomass as an option, what those supporters fail to acknowledge is that there will be competing interests for this fuel source. Congress recently increased the mandate for renewable fuels, which means more will need to come from cellulosic biomass. This will be on top of what the pulp and paper industry already uses to produce its product. Add to that the need from the energy industry and you are looking at substantial competition among sectors for the same product. As we all know, when demand for a product outpaces supply, prices tend to increase. As a regulator my main concern is to ensure consumers are protected and are provided with safe and secure low-cost electricity. This is especially important in the Southeast where the cost of energy makes up a significant portion of their monthly household budgets. Because of the lack of available wind or solar resources, biomass would have to be counted on for compliance. If biomass cannot provide the amount of electricity that is required to meet the annual requirement then utilities and their consumers will have only two options available to them for compliance--either buy a REC or pay the ACP. During testimony it was somewhat glossed over, but the fact is that no electricity comes with the ACP or the REC. Therefore, consumers will continue to pay, like they do today, for the electricity needed to keep their lights on, but they will also be required to pay extra for either the REC or the ACP under the new mandate. Neither the REC nor the ACP will provide these consumers with any additional benefit for what they are required to pay. Instead, the required payment will either be sent to states that have the resources available, helping them expand their economic development initiatives, or go to the federal government for new government programs subject to appropriations. To force consumers to pay additional costs, not because they refuse to do something, but because they can't do it, seems unjust, unfair and unreasonable. Back in this Committee passed a mandate requiring a certain amount of fuel sold in the U.S. to contain renewable fuel, such as ethanol. And in Congress increased this mandate. A lot of people support this mandate as a way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and I think it can provide some context to today's debate on renewable electricity. What if Congress changed the law and said that instead of applying nation-wide, the mandate required fuel sold in each state to contain a specific amount of renewable content--I assume there would still be significant support for the program. Now, add that the renewable content can only come from sources grown in that state and can only be sugarcane, rice or cotton. If the requirement is not met, then the federal gas tax is increased by - cents per gallon. This, at its very core, is what Congress and supporters of a one-size-fits-all renewable approach are contemplating for the electricity sector--do it using these resources or pay a penalty. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``As currently proposed, the RPS defines renewable fuels only as solar, wind, geothermal, ocean energy, landfill gas, biomass, and new hydro. Solar and wind are not viable broad-scale generation technologies in Alabama. Biomass has some potential, but even it is limited. Given this, plus the fact that no consideration is given to either nuclear or existing hydro, Alabama will be left with little alternative but to buy its way into compliance through the purchase of Renewable Energy Credits Alternative Compliance Payment. Unfortunately, for Alabama, this reduces an RPS to nothing more than a transfer of wealth or a tax. Interestingly, and perhaps ironically, the Department of Energy's own study ranks Alabama th in the nation and st in the Southeast in the use of renewable generation. Importantly, this study takes into account Alabama's existing hydro generation. generation that is excluded under the proposed standard.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``By definition, renewable generation requires a premium over conventional generation in the Southeast. Otherwise, renewable developers would not need a state or federal RPS to increase the amount they are paid for their electric generation. If utilities are required to purchase renewable generation as an alternative to conventional generation, these additional costs must be passed through to their customers--resulting in higher utility rates. States, if they desire, should be allowed the freedom to develop indigenous renewable resources to supplement conventional generation to support policies of improved air quality and reduced carbon emissions. Stakeholders and policy- makers in North Carolina, in adopting a REPS, have reached agreement on how much consumers are willing and should be required to pay to fund renewable generation yet avoid job losses due to increased electricity rates.'' Question . In the Southeast, only North Carolina has adopted a state renewable mandate. How does that program differ than the federal program proposed in this draft legislation? How would North Carolina's program, and its ratepayers, be impacted by the adoption of a federal mandate? Answer. The NC Utilities Commission authorized an independent study to look at the feasibility of implementing an energy portfolio mandate. It came to the conclusion that NC could implement a standard, but much less aggressive than what is being contemplated at the federal level. The NC standard has a more reasonable long-term goal of . percent by and more realistic interim requirements to meet this goal. Unlike the majority proposal, the NC standard also has price caps--capping the amount consumers will be forced to pay as a result of the policy. When a federal standard is implemented, much of the investment being made at the state level will be diverted in order to try and comply with the federal requirement. When there are certain carve-outs at the state level (like swine and poultry carve-outs in NC) investment must continue in those areas even if they do not comport with the federal standard. There will continue to be questions of how competing standards can work together without the federal standard replacing what the state has diligently put in place. The NC REPS differs from the federal proposals in several ways, including: a lower requirement; the highest North Carolina REPS requirement is . %. a higher allowed percentage from energy efficiency; up to % of the highest REPS requirement can be satisfied by energy efficiency savings. the presence of a monetary cap on compliance costs which protects customers from excessive rates. no alternative compliance payment. the inclusion of solar thermal and waste heat recovery. Because the federal proposals impose a substantially greater RPS requirement and lack any cost cap, the costs to North Carolina citizens will be much greater under the federal proposals than the North Carolina REPS. RPS compliance costs to North Carolina residential ratepayers could easily triple under the federal proposals as compared to the NC requirements. The NCUC has the authority to modify or delay the program if that is in the public interest. Question . You propose that before Congress moves forward with a national RPS, we should first direct those states that don't already have a program, to create one. Would the states support such an action? If so, how quickly could states without current programs develop those programs? It is unrealistic to assume that states can meet the mandates of a federal `one-size-fits-all' renewable policy. More than half the states have passed some form of an advanced energy portfolio, but I do not believe any of these programs directly align with what Senator Bingaman and others are proposing. While some states have chosen to implement energy portfolios, others have assessed their resources and decided otherwise. As Senator Bayh indicated during the hearing, Indiana looked at implementing a standard and chose not to. They concluded they did not have the resources available for such a standard. So, is the federal government simply going to tell those officials that they were wrong and simply didn't look closely enough? States are in the unique position to decide what is best for their constituencies when it comes to delivering in-state electricity. They are positioned to gather all the necessary information and make an informed decision on what is available and how to provide incentives for increased energy generation. North Carolina did this and is the first southern state to implement a renewable standard. But North Carolina, like other states that have implemented similar programs, included a price cap on the amount the program could cost consumers. In North Carolina the maximum annual cost of the program to each class of customer is capped as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ and - - thereafter ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Residential $ /year $ /year $ /year ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Commercial $ /year $ /year $ /year ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Industrial $ /year $ , /year $ , /year ------------------------------------------------------------------------ One way to ensure states move forward on implementing some type of energy standard is to set a federal floor and then, like transportation funding, have future federal funding for renewables tied to states implementing a program that equals or goes beyond the federal level. This carrot approach, as opposed to the stick mentality currently being advocated at the federal level, would incent states to move forward as quickly and as reasonably as possible without being punitive in nature. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``Inherent in the notion that any State would develop its own RPS is the assumption that is would do so in a way that makes sense for that State. For Alabama, it is reasonable to assume such a program would most certainly include existing hydro. It is equally reasonable that such a program would be largely void of solar and wind requirements. That being the case, given the requirements of the current proposed Federal RPS, development of such a program would appear to be an exercise in futility. If, however, State programs were to be deemed as satisfying any Federal requirement, then such a pursuit would be more worthwhile and would be more likely to gain support.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``Each state should have the opportunity to decide what is appropriate for itself given the diversity of resources available in the state or surrounding region. In addition, states should be able to assess how costly they are willing to let electricity become in order to gain the advantages of renewable resources. State policy-makers are accountable to the electorate for increases in the price of electricity due to renewable policy. While Congress may wish to consider how best to encourage states without and RPS to adopt such a program, it should respect the decisions with regard to cost, resource eligibility, etc. made in those states that have already adopted and RPS. Federal policy- makers should respect the decisions already made in North Carolina and other states regarding how much their citizens should be required to pay for green energy and to what degree they are willing to accept unbundled renewable energy RECs from out-of-state.'' Response of David A. Wright to Question From Senator Landrieu Question . I know that we can achieve efficiency gains in both the interstate transmission of electricity as well as the retail distribution of electricity. In Sen. Bingaman's draft language that has been circulated, it only allows for savings from the retail distribution of electricity. Don't you think there are huge efficiency gains to be made through efficiency upgrades to our transmission backbone? Shouldn't that also be included in any efficiency portion of a RES? Answer. There are gains to be made in transmission grid efficiency, and the savings should also be encouraged and recognized in any efficiency portion of a RES. While losses on a transmission grid are relatively low as a percentage of the power transferred, the magnitude of the power transfers would produce significant savings for even small gains in efficiency. So the simple answer to this question is yes, but with consideration given to cost-effectiveness, too. Recently, the subject of increasing the reliability and efficiency of our transmission grid has received a lot of attention, especially when it comes to connecting renewable energy to the grid. The fact is, development of renewable sources will be in rural areas and the electricity generated will need to be transported over long distances to serve the load centers. At this point it would seem that the transmission needed to carry renewable energy to those load centers is just as important as erecting the wind turbines or solar panels which would supply the power. If this measure is truly intended to be a first-step in addressing climate change, the question that needs to be answered is why should we artificially limit the investment that utilities can make in energy efficiency? According to the proposal, only percent of the yearly requirement can come from energy efficiency. This means that utilities can only invest a certain amount in energy efficiency and then they are required to re-direct investment to paying for needed RECs or ACPs. It would seem more logical that utilities be allowed to meet as much of the requirement as possible through energy efficiency. At least then consumers of those utilities would see actual benefits from the program. In the recently enacted stimulus package Congress provided approximately $ billion for energy efficiency. This shows that efficiency is critical and it seems inappropriate for Congress on the one hand to provide so much public funding for it, but on the other hand limit the amount of investment by the private sector. Additionally, since increased transmission is critical to bringing new renewables onto the grid, it would seem that investment in transmission upgrades should count towards achieving compliance with the standard. In this way, the RPS requirement could be seen as a tax liability and investment, up to a certain point, and could be used as a tax credit--offsetting the costs associated with not achieving the renewable amount required under the mandate. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``Opportunities for energy efficiency gains, while most likely yielding more potential at distribution levels, should not be limited to those locations. Utilities should have the liberty to try and achieve efficiency gains where they are most warranted (distribution or transmission).'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``Utilities should be encouraged to increase efficiency in all aspects of their operations, including electric generation, transmission and distribution.'' Responses of David A. Wright to Questions From Senator Sessions Question . What are we trying to achieve through a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES)? What are the goals? By focusing solely on renewables, are we limiting our options to achieve an adequate supply of clean, low-carbon, reliable and affordable electricity? Answer. Yes, by focusing solely on renewables, we are limiting our options for achieving an adequate supply of clean, low-carbon, reliable and affordable electricity. If the goal is to reduce carbon emissions, and encourage clean, safe, reliable, low-carbon and affordable sources of electricity, then other options such as nuclear power should be included. Our goal should be to encourage all clean energy sources to meet our future energy needs. We should not focus only a narrow definition of certain energy sources like wind, solar, biomass and geothermal. That narrow definition does not even include all renewable sources since the majority draft does not include hydro-electric energy. The federal government should not pick winners and losers for certain energy technologies. States and regions should be able to focus on meeting their energy needs in ways that make the most sense for their economies and ratepayers. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``The goals of any Renewable Electricity Standard should be to improve air quality, lower American dependence on foreign fuel sources, and encourage clean, economical, dependable electric generation. To achieve these goals, any Renewable Electricity Standard must include and encourage the use of clean alternative fuels including nuclear energy and clean coal technology. Any Renewable Electricity Standard must ensure that States are given sufficient latitude to pursue the inclusion of clean energy alternatives that make sense for their individual economies.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``Many states, in addition to the reduction of carbon emissions, have enacted an RPS to support the following policy goals: ( ) improved air quality from reduced emissions from conventional fossil-fired generating facilities; ( ) increased energy independence through the development of indigenous energy resources, such as wind, biomass, solar, hydro, etc.; ( ) increased economic development and increase of local tax base from the construction, operation, fuel collection, and other activities associated with indigenous energy resources; and ( ) the potential to attract manufacturers and other ``green'' jobs associated with an increase in demand for renewable generation in the state. A federal RPS with national markets for renewable energy RECs supports none of these additional goals. Rather, it merely creates a rush to purchase credits from wind-rich regions, thus straining the transmission infrastructure in those regions while providing no local economic benefit to those required to pay the bills. North Carolina has already decided what its citizens are willing to pay for the benefits of locally-sited renewable energy.'' Question . If the main concern surrounding RES is to have clean energy then we should consider nuclear power. Nuclear power is produced in the United States, it has zero carbon dioxide emissions, and it does not put stress on agriculture products or the timber industry. Why has this source not been considered in the RES discussion? Answer. Nuclear power absolutely should be included in any conversation about clean energy. Unfortunately, some supporters of a federal RES also oppose nuclear power. Nuclear is the only base load electricity source available that has zero emissions of greenhouse gases or other pollutants. A federal RES that imposes the same standard across the country will result in ratepayers in some regions sending their money to purchase RECs or make alternative compliance payments to the federal government. Such money could be invested in clean energy sources like nuclear that can reliably and cost effectively serve those areas. Some environmentalists have refused to acknowledge that if the goal is to reduce carbon emissions, nuclear generation is a cost effective viable solution that must be considered. There is not one legitimate argument to exclude nuclear. The concerns raised most often are ``safety'' and spent fuel storage. Regarding safety, this argument was debunked decades ago. Nuclear generation for electricity and nuclear powered military ships has been safely operated for over years. Regarding spent fuel storage, the US is obligated to take possession and build a national repository. Even in the event this does not happen, safe on-site storage is available and has been tested over time. In addition, while the supply of uranium to fuel nuclear reactors is finite, as reprocessing of used nuclear fuel becomes more prevalent and economic, nuclear fuel becomes virtually renewable. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``That nuclear energy has been excluded from this discussion is indeed puzzling. Nuclear plants don't burn fossil fuels, therefore they produce zero air emissions. Nuclear generation is the only large-scale, clean-air electricity source that can be expanded widely to produce large amounts of electricity in the Southeast in general and Alabama in particular. Any Renewable Electricity Standard should focus on lowering emissions and encouraging cleaner production of electricity. Clean generation sources, like nuclear, must be part of any serious discussion of this issue.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``While it may be appropriate to credit nuclear energy in greenhouse gas reduction policy, we did not find it necessary to include nuclear power in the NC RPS. Nuclear energy is a relatively mature technology and receives its own economic subsidies. Nuclear generating facilities already provide a substantial amount of energy in North Carolina and other states, and a number of new nuclear facilities have been proposed. Nevertheless, we agree that the option for future development of nuclear power must be maintained. One important hurdle continues to be the inaccessibility of funds in the Nuclear Waste Fund for the development of the Yucca Mountain repository. North Carolina consumers are one of the largest contributors to that fund.'' Question . Why do you include energy sources that may yield some benefit in the future and do not have any short term benefits, but continue to exclude nuclear power that has both short term and long term benefits? Answer. SEARUC and the utilities in the Southeast support nuclear power as a clean, reliable energy resource. As discussed in the answer to your second question, I believe that all clean energy sources should be utilized in meeting our future energy needs and that certainly would include nuclear power. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``Nuclear generation must be a part of any serious discussion of a Renewable Energy Standard.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``Just as with renewable energy resources, each state's decision with respect to the extent of use of nuclear generation should be respected. Utilities in North Carolina are looking at nuclear as well as other options to meet their obligation to provide safe, reliable power at a reasonable cost to consumers.'' Question . The US consumes approximately gigawatts of electricity every year. The RES legislation would require approximately - gigawatts to come from renewable energy sources by . What percentage of the renewable energy mandate will be supplied by wind and why does wind have a larger potential than other renewable sources such as hydro or nuclear? Answer. Wind does not necessarily have greater potential than nuclear; however, nuclear power is not included in the list of eligible resources listed in the draft proposals. While there are significant wind resources in the U.S., not all regions of the country have readily available, cost effective wind resources. The majority of potential wind resources available in the Southeast are offshore and face technical and economic challenges that on-shore resources in other areas of the country do not. It is difficult to say how much of a % RPS would be met with wind in all parts of the country. Georgia tells me, very little will be contributed by wind unless their utilities purchase wind tags from other states. Obviously states in the west and upper midwest would have a greater ability to rely on wind to meet renewables requirements than other regions. But, even in those states, as compared to other sources like nuclear or hydro, wind would have a lower capacity factor and be more unreliable. Wind generation will also require the installation of large amounts of natural gas generation to provide the power when wind power is not available. Recent studies have shown this could be up to % of the time. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``The Southeast in general and Alabama in particular, will be virtually unable to rely on wind energy to meet any RES requirement. A sustained wind of about . mph is the threshold for reliable wind generation. The vast majority of locations in Alabama do not meet this threshold.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``While the potential for new wind development may be larger than that of hydro (because of opposition to new impoundments and the prior development of significant hydro resources), its potential is not likely larger than nuclear. In addition, nuclear and wind have different operating characteristics that do not make them comparable. Nuclear operates at % capacity factor, while wind operates only when the wind blows and cannot be relied upon to operate when its power is needed. Thus, much more wind capacity is necessary to generate the same amount of energy as from a conventional generating facility. Even then, the actual generation from wind may be zero when needed on a hot summer afternoon.'' Question . In your opinion, how will the Southeast states meet their mandate requirements since wind is not a significant energy source in this region? Independent studies have shown the most readily available renewable resource is biomass, primarily wood waste from the forest industry. However, studies in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida estimate that biomass can practically provide only about to % of utilities' retail sales, leaving a significant gap to meet a % renewable requirement. Solar generation would also play a part; however, solar generation is currently one of the most costly renewable resources, which may limit the amount installed due to other competitive renewable resources available in other regions of the country. I believe that the Southeast can meet limited amounts of the proposed RES mandate requirements with energy efficiency and possible conversion of some older coal plants to biomass, new construction biomass including landfill gas, and also co-firing of existing coal facilities with wood and/or agricultural waste. But, utilizing these resources will increase costs to the ratepayer. Energy efficiency is limited to % of the % mandate and it is not practical for biomass to meet the % requirement either. I believe most of the compliance with the federal RES in the Southeast will come from either purchasing RECs from other regions or making alternative compliance payments to the federal government. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``Assuming that nuclear and existing hydro are excluded (which they shouldn't be), Alabama will left with little choice but to resort to the purchase of Renewable Energy Credits of payment of an Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP). Biomass does hold some compliance opportunity for the Southeast, but even it is limited.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``Utilities in Southeastern states will have no option in meeting such a high federal mandate but to purchase renewable energy RECs from out-of-state or purchase credits from DOE''. Question . How will a RES affect the price of electricity in Southeast states? A Federal RPS proposal, such as that proposed by Senator Bingaman, could easily increase rates in the Southeast by to %. More aggressive requirements, such as the -by- proposal, could increase rates by to %. As noted in the North Carolina La Capra study, costs are not scalable because higher RPS requirements will necessitate greater use of higher cost resources. Prices will increase if Southern states are required to build or purchase renewable energy when other forms of energy are cheaper. It is unavoidable that ratepayers will pay more for electricity due to the imposition of a federal RES. Resources, like biomass, that are available in the region have a higher cost than the current energy sources of coal, nuclear and hydro. The gap between what can be achieved with energy efficiency and biomass will have to be met by either purchasing RECs from other regions or making alternative compliance payments to the federal government. Billions of dollars will be paid by ratepayers in the Southeast for this program. This could equate to several hundred dollars a year in higher electric bills to the individual ratepayer. This money will mostly be sent to other regions or the federal government rather than being available to invest in energy infrastructure to meet the future needs of the state or region where the ratepayer lives. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``An RES will cause electricity prices in Alabama to rise.precipitously. Unfortunately, because Alabama would likely have to comply with an RES (at least as currently proposed) through the ACP, Alabama ratepayers will see absolutely no benefit associated with compliance.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): See answer to Senator Murkowski, Question # . Response of David A. Wright to Question From Senator Mark Udall Question . Currently, does each state rely exclusively or substantially on fuels derived from that state to generate electricity? Particularly for the Southeast, where does the fuel come from that currently provides electricity generation? Answer. This was an issue that was also discussed during the hearing. Approximately % of the electric generation in the Southeast is provided by coal, which is procured predominately from the central and northern Appalachian region. % is provided from nuclear generation and the balance is from natural gas, oil and other sources. While a great deal of the fuel used to generate electricity comes from out-of-state, there are significant differences in relying upon out-of-state traditional fuels as compared to relying upon intermittent renewable resources to generate electricity in another region of the country which is then delivered over transmission lines. ) The total cost of electricity generated from coal and uranium is very economical compared to the total cost of renewable resources. ) Supplies of coal and uranium fuel can be managed to maintain sufficient fuel inventories to ride through high prices and/or supply disruptions and continue to generate low- cost electricity. The delivery of renewable-generated electricity from some other region over transmissions lines is not as reliable due to the intermittent nature of renewables such as wind and solar, and also because delivery of the energy is subject to interruption due to transmission line outages resulting from storms or other causes. ) The cost of the additional transmission lines necessary to deliver large amounts of energy from another region will be costly, and siting of the lines will be controversial and time consuming. ) The transmission of electricity over long distances, such as from the Midwest to the Southeast, would result in significant electrical losses which will reduce the amount of electricity actually delivered, These losses are avoided when electricity is generated in closer proximity to load centers where it is delivered to end-use customers. ) Although the fuel is imported, the investment in generation, transmission and distribution remains in the state and creates jobs in the state. Such is not the case with renewable resources located outside the state. While it is correct that coal, natural gas and uranium are imported by states for generation purposes, it is usually more cost effective to transport fuels such as uranium, coal or natural gas than to transport electricity. That is why generation has almost always been built near the load. In addition, it does not follow that wind and other renewable resources could be substituted for current electric generation in these states. Under this theory wind or solar would have to be imported and then used to generate electricity to displace the current generation in a state--which cannot be done. Even if the transmission capability existed to import all the electricity required to meet the standard, it would be at an increased cost to consumers and would not provide the local economic benefits that electricity generated in-state would carry. Also, if the RES is supposed to be a step to reducing carbon then why not look at nuclear generation? Increasing the amount of nuclear generation would increase local economic development and increase local job creation, both during construction and long-term plant operation. As I have stated in previous questions, the REC or the ACP does not provide any electricity. Therefore, customers in those states that lack renewable resources would still have to rely on their current electric generation in addition to paying the costs for the REC or ACP, all for no additional benefit. (Alabama sent the following comment): ``Many states meet a material amount of their electric generation fuel needs within their state. Alabama is no exception, and sources much of its fuel needs from in-state coal, natural gas, hydro, as well as some biomass from customer owned generation facilities. In the United States electrically utilities source almost all of their fuel needs within the country. This is largely due to the reliance on and abundant availability of coal within the United States.'' (Comments from the North Carolina Utilities Commission in response to this question): ``Utilities in North Carolina primarily rely on coal, nuclear, and natural gas for electric generation--each of which is purchased from out-of-state. This, in part, led North Carolina to adopt an RPS to support development of indigenous energy resources, such as small-scale hydro, solar, wind, and biomass. In addition to the increased energy independence, development of in-state energy resources provides for local air quality improvements and local economic development. The difference between purchasing fuel from out-of-state and purchasing renewable energy RECs from out-of-state is that in the latter case consumers are incurring an additional cost with no additional benefit''. ______ Responses of Ralph Izzo to Questions From Senator Murkowski Question . How much back up power from conventional power plants is needed to meet a % RPS requirement by ? At what cost? Answer. The amount and cost of backup energy that will be necessary is dependent on many variables, including what type of renewable generation is developed and where it is located. Therefore, it is difficult to predict with much accuracy how much back up power would be needed, and at what cost. Some types of renewable generation, such as biomass or geothermal energy deliver consistent and reliable power and can be treated much like traditional generation assets. Intermittent renewable generation resources will need back up power at times, but with a diversity of generation resources, the use of demand response, and improved energy storage technologies--such as batteries or compressed air storage--we can improve reliability and help minimize any additional cost. Question . Do you agree that as it now stands, our country's transmission infrastructure is woefully inadequate to achieve a % by RPS requirement? Answer. Whether or not our transmission infrastructure is adequate to support % renewable generation depends entirely on where renewable generation is built. For example, with significant growth in offshore wind generation located close to electric load centers in the Northeast, you could expand our nation's renewable resources significantly without major new transmission infrastructure. Question . What are the estimated infrastructure costs to meet the legislation's requirement? How realistic is it to get the necessary transmission in place in time to meet the hard and fast deadlines of the national mandate? Should Congress build some flexibility into the program if inadequate transmission prevents compliance? Answer. The scale of necessary infrastructure upgrades will depend on where the renewable generation is built. The time and expense of new transmission is a factor that should be considered in such decisions. For example, currently offshore wind is more expensive to build than onshore wind, but when the associated time and expense of transmission is considered, offshore wind becomes a more attractive investment. By creating an open national market for renewable generation credits and allowing for alternative compliance payments, I believe the majority staff draft builds in the necessary flexibility to deal with these and other complicating factors. Question . Given the different goals and definitions of renewable energy in the various state renewable energy standard programs, how does the majority staff draft ensure consistency and coordination of the state and federal programs? Answer. The majority staff draft sets the appropriate framework for coordinating state and federal programs. As I understand it, credits for state RPS requirements can be used to meet the federal obligation, as long as they are generated from a renewable resource that meets the federal definition of renewable energy. Some details about federal and state coordination remain to be worked out, but that should be addressed by subsequent regulations promulgated by the Department of Energy. Question . Do you agree that any federal RPS program must account for the regional variations in the supply of renewable resources? Answer. I believe the majority staff draft does account for regional variations in the supply of renewable resources by creating a national market for renewable energy credits, allowing states to purchase credits from the least cost renewable generation anywhere in the country. Each region has its relative strengths and weaknesses with regard to renewable resources, which will be reflected in the types of investments that are made in each region. Furthermore, each state remains free to enact policies to develop local renewable energy industries. Question . I understand that in order to meet New Jersey's . % RPS requirement by , offshore wind would need to provide % of the renewable energy. According to reports, that means you need at least , megawatts generated by offshore wind turbines by and at least , megawatts by . Given that we still have no offshore wind power production in this country--and this despite several years of effort on the Cape Wind proposal--such a scenario seems wildly optimistic. How do you respond? Answer. Governor Corzine has set a goal of , MW of offshore wind by and , MW by . The State is developing a series of policy initiatives to help New Jersey reach that goal. PSEG is currently developing a MW offshore wind project that will be supported by these state policies. We believe that Governor Corzine's leadership on this issue, will allow us to overcome existing barriers to offshore wind and develop an industry that will create local jobs, improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions. The state's offshore wind initiative will help New Jersey meet its RPS; however, offshore wind is not essential for New Jersey to meet its RPS targets because New Jersey's standard can be met with any renewable generation within PJM, our regional electric grid. Thus far, New Jersey has fully complied with its RPS through the development of renewable generation throughout PJM. Question . How is the financial crisis impacting your company's planned renewable projects? I understand that PSEG anticipates cutting back its expected investments on some wind and solar projects. Answer. What is the status of PSEG's Solar Initiative? In , your company introduced a $ -million plan to spur the investment of solar systems on homes, businesses, and municipal buildings. This program was to help you fulfill % of your RPS requirements for and . Do any of these problems at the state level signal a need for greater flexibility in a federal program? The financial crisis has forced every company to reevaluate its capital spending, and PSEG is no exception. However, we are moving ahead with the renewable energy projects we have previously announced, and New Jersey is continuing to meet its RPS requirements. The renewable energy projects PSEG is pursuing include a - megawatt offshore wind farm. We are also continuing to implement our $ million solar loan program, which is poised to help finance over MW of solar generation projects. And we recently announced a proposal for our utility to invest in nearly $ million of solar generation on government buildings, low-income housing, brownfields and utility poles. These investments are driven by our state RPS, and we believe such investments are particularly important during an economic downturn as they can create jobs and help stimulate our local economy. Question . Would it be correct to say that your state regulators carefully analyzed the needs and available resources in New Jersey in the course of developing its RPS policy? Answer. Our state RPS can be fulfilled with renewable generation located anywhere in PJM, our regional electric grid (with the exception of our solar carve out, which must be met with New Jersey-based generation). Therefore, in evaluating our state RPS, our regulators focused on evaluating the available renewable resources located throughout the PJM region. Question . It is my understanding that the New Jersey . % by RPS requirement is subdivided into different classes of eligible resources--Class I (solar, wind, biomass, and a few others); Class II (small hydro and ``resource recovery facilities''); and a requirement that solar comprise a certain percentage of the total. Answer. New Jersey's structure obviously differs from the majority staff draft. How do you believe the differences between the federal program and New Jersey's program should be resolved? I do not believe these differences need to be resolved because, as I understand it, the majority staff draft does not preempt states from pursuing their own state standards, which may include different definitions of renewable energy than the federal standard. This will add some complexity to efforts to coordinate state and federal programs, but I believe these issues can be resolved through the regulatory process as the Department of Energy develops rules for coordinating state programs. Question . Is it fair to say that the adoption of a federal RPS will create investment opportunities for your company? Answer. A federal RPS would create business opportunities for any company that wants to invest in renewable generation. In turn, this will create jobs and provide stimulus for our economy. PSEG's core businesses are an electric and gas distribution utility, a nuclear generation company and a fossil fuel generation company, which includes both coal and natural gas powered generation assets. We are beginning to grow both a regulated and unregulated renewable generation business, but these businesses are in the early stages of development. However, we see renewable energy as part of our long-term growth strategy. Question . Is it correct that you believe nuclear energy is vital to a carbon-constrained future and that all options must remain on the table? Answer. Yes. If we are to reduce carbon emissions % by , we need to aggressively pursue energy efficiency, renewable energy and clean central station power, such as nuclear generation. I believe an RPS is the best policy to directly support renewable electric generation. Different policies should be used to support energy efficiency and clean central station power. Question . In , before the financial crisis, you were quoted in New Jersey Business as saying: . . . we are asking people to sacrifice in exchange for the environmental benefits. For some customers, the choice might mean not buying the extra sail for the boat. For others, it might mean not being able to put that third meal on the table. Some people are more concerned about meeting today's bills than being concerned about carbon dioxide levels yeas from now. I'm not concerned with the guy who can't buy a new sail for his boat, but we're all concerned with asking people already hard hit to choose between energy and putting meals on the table. Is this a fair choice? Answer. PSEG serves the majority of New Jersey's low-and moderate- income families, and I am concerned about their ability to pay for green investments. As I said in my testimony, in the long run investing in renewable energy will be a net benefit for customers, but in the short run it will be more expensive. In the worst case scenario, by the majority staff draft would impose an additional three cents per kilowatt hour on % of our electricity, or an additional . cents on all of our electricity. Presuming we have cent electricity that would mean an increase of roughly % in , or approximately . % per year. For most families this cost is manageable, but for families struggling to make ends meet it will be an added burden. PSEG is a strong proponent of LIHEAP and state-based programs designed to help customers pay their energy bills, because no family should be forced to choose between heat and putting food on their table. We also strongly support energy efficiency programs targeted at low- and moderate-income families. Our utility is beginning to implement such programs in our urban areas to help families reduce their bills. Response of Ralph Izzo to Question From Senator Landrieu Question . I know that we can achieve efficiency gains in both the interstate transmission of electricity as well as the retail distribution of electricity. In Sen. Bingaman's draft language that has been circulated, it only allows for savings from the retail distribution of electricity. Don't you think there are huge efficiency gains to be made through efficiency upgrades to our transmission backbone? Shouldn't that also be included in any efficiency portion of a RES? Answer. I agree that we could make efficiency improvements in both our transmission and distribution systems. I believe, however, that the RPS should be used exclusively to promote renewable generation, and that other federal policies should be developed to incent investments in energy efficiency. Both are needed. Responses of Ralph Izzo to Questions From Senator Sessions Question . What are we trying to achieve through a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES)? What are the goals? By focusing solely on renewables, are we limiting our options to achieve an adequate supply of clean, low-carbon, reliable and affordable electricity? Answer. I believe the goal of the RPS is to increase our use of renewable electric generation and to develop industries that will benefit our environment and economy for generations. And as we electrify our transportation sector, renewable electric generation will become critical to America's energy security. To make the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are necessary to avert catastrophic impacts from climate change, we need a portfolio of policies. This should include a national carbon cap-and-trade system, adequate incentives for new nuclear generation, programs to promote energy efficiency, and a federal RPS that will drive demand for technologies that will transform the way we generate electricity. Question . If the main concern surrounding RES is to have clean energy then we should consider nuclear power. Nuclear power is produced in the United States, it has zero carbon dioxide emissions, and it does not put stress on agriculture products or the timber industry. Why has this source not been considered in the RES discussion? Answer. I agree that nuclear power has to be part of our climate change solution. However, nuclear power is not a renewable resource. Moreover, the challenges for building new nuclear are different than the challenges of growing renewable energy industries. Nuclear power requires a very large, up-front capital investment; it has a very long construction time; and it faces unique regulatory hurdles. We need federal support for new nuclear generation, but that support is not best delivered through an RPS. Question . Why do you include energy sources that may yield some benefit in the future and do not have any short term benefits, but continue to exclude nuclear power that has both short term and long term benefits? Answer. Please see the answer to question # above. Question . The US consumes approximately gigawatts of electricity every year. The RES legislation would require approximately - gigawatts to come from renewable energy sources by . What percentage of the renewable energy mandate will be supplied by wind and why does wind have a larger potential than other renewable sources such as hydro or nuclear? Answer. It is difficult to predict with any accuracy the percentage of the RPS that will be fulfilled by any one generation technology. At this point, onshore wind is among the most cost-competitive renewable generation resources, so we would expect a significant percentage of the RPS to be met with onshore wind. However, as the RPS drives investment into renewable energy industries we could see significant improvements in the capacity factors and reductions in the production costs of other renewable energy technologies, making them more competitive. Nuclear and hydro power constitute a far greater percentage of our current electric generating capacity than any of the other technologies eligible under the majority staff draft bill; however, there are unique challenges to expanding our reliance on either nuclear energy or hydro power. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the relative potential of nuclear power, hydro and onshore wind. But all forms of carbon-free electricity will be needed to reduce emissions % by . Question . In your opinion, how will the Southeast states meet their mandate requirements since wind is not a significant energy source in this region? Answer. It is difficult to predict specifically how different states will comply with a federal RPS, particularly over the long term. As some of the maps that were entered into the record indicate, the southeastern states have considerable potential to develop biomass generation. In addition, state policies can drive investment in certain renewable technologies. For example, because of state policies, New Jersey is second in the nation to California in solar installations despite having relatively weak solar energy resources. To the extent that local renewable generation resources are not sufficient to meet the federal RPS, all states will be able to purchase the lowest cost renewable energy credits from anywhere in the country. Question . How will a RES affect the price of electricity in Southeast states? Answer. With the exception of states that are already paying for state RPS programs, the cost of complying with the RPS should be fairly equal in all regions of the country. This is because the majority staff draft sets up a national renewable credit trading system, under which all states will have the opportunity to buy renewable credits from the least-cost renewable generation resources in the country. Response of Ralph Izzo to Question From Senator Menendez Question . Dr. Izzo, as you know New Jersey has a specific carve out for solar technology in its Renewable Portfolio Standard. You have testified that you do not believe there should be a carve out for a specific technology, such as solar, for a national Renewable Electricity Standard. I do not agree, but I can understand how one could think that a national standard should not single out one technology in this manner. I am concerned, however, that the RES proposal before us would drive investment only for onshore wind. If we rely so heavily on one technology I believe that in a decade or so we would regret such a policy because the best land-based wind resources can only take us so far. One way to ensure a wide variety of technologies are incentivized by a National Electricity Standard would be to include a reverse carve out. This would mean that no one technology could be used to fulfill more than a certain percentage of the RES. Such an approach could help spur distributed sources of generation, biomass, offshore wind, geothermal, and a host of other technologies. Would you support a reverse carve out in a national Renewable Electricity Standard? Answer. Yes I would. As I said in my testimony, it is important that we use the RPS and other tools to support a range of technologies in our effort to decarbonize our electric generation. If we establish a strong, federal RPS, I believe it will create a flourishing national market for renewable generation, which I expect will drive investment toward a number of renewable technologies. However, a reverse carve out would be a sensible backstop to ensure that the RPS does not almost exclusively support a single technology. Responses of Ralph Izzo to Questions From Senator Mark Udall Question . Each region of the U.S. is blessed with excellent renewable resources. If wind power potential is not very good in the southeastern U.S., does that mean that utilities in that region of the country will be unable to provide their customers with electricity generated from renewable resources under a RES? Answer. No. The majority staff draft would allow states to meet the RPS requirements either with the development of local renewable energy resources, or by purchasing renewable energy certificates generated anywhere else in the nation. Question . During the Bush Administration, the Energy Information Administration analyzed several different national RES legislative proposals. In each case, EIA determined that biomass would receive the most RES credits of any renewable technology eligible to receive credits. Please identify which regions of the country have the greatest biomass potential. Answer. Analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicates that there are strong biomass resources in the West, Upper Midwest and Southeast, along with pockets of biomass potential in various other states throughout the country. Question . If the U.S. were to generate up to % of its power from renewable resources, how would this impact our country's reliance on natural gas to generate electricity? Answer. If the U.S. generated % of its electricity from renewable resources, that would reduce demand for electricity generated from traditional resources. Analysis from the Energy Information Administration shows that the decreased demand for traditional generation would reduce our demand for, and reliance on, natural gas. Question . If the country switches to plug-in hybrids to power our automobiles and also adopts a % national RES, what would the impact be on oil and gas imports over the next years? Answer. Transitioning from gasoline-powered cars to electric cars is crucial for our long-term energy security and our efforts to reduce demand for foreign oil. But as we electrify our transportation sector, it will become increasingly important that we decarbonize our electric generation so that we can reduce our carbon emissions. If we can pursue these two goals in tandem, we will reduce oil imports, reduce demand for natural gas, reduce carbon emissions and increase our energy security. ______ Responses of Lester B. Lave to Questions From Senator Bingaman Question . You argue that we should include nuclear power and coal with carbon equestration in our standard. I we did so would we not have to make this standard much higher in order to achieve within it the goals that we would hope for with those technologies? Answer. You are correct. If an RES contained nuclear and CCS, it should be much larger than %. I favor including more ``reduced carbon'' technologies in the standard in order to allow greater flexibility for states that don't have one or another of the resources. The proposed legislation singles out several technologies as being the answer to social concerns including carbon-dioxide emissions, sustainability, air pollution emissions, energy security, and environmental quality more generally. Renewable do help meet some of these concerns, but they are not the only technologies for doing this and, in many cases, are neither the most effective way of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions nor the least cost way of providing the electricity. While I believe that renewables will become an essential part of the way of attaining these goals, along with energy efficiency, one clear lesson from the s is that the market place, not Congress or the Department of Energy, should choose the winning technologies. Congress and DOE must make decisions about R&D, but this is quite different from mandating that a technology be deployed. While I am concern about energy security, general environmental quality, and sustainability, these are not large problems for electricity generation at this time. Congress and EPA have firm control of general environmental quality; I see no need to press for renewables to improve general environmental quality. Sustainability is not the highest priority now, since we have adequate uranium and coal resources. Natural gas could become a sustainability concern, if the shales do not produce as much natural gas as some project. Thus, my primary concern for electricity generation is carbon-dioxide emissions. I support and urge Congress and DOE to adequately fund basic research on photovoltaic technology and battery technologies. Both are key to our future, but neither is sufficiently developed for commercial success in baseload generation (photovoltaic) or applications such as plug-in hybrid vehicles or electric vehicles. Question . If you acknowledge that the main obstacles to nuclear power are lack of a solution to the waste problem, concerns over proliferation of nuclear weapons, and costs, what is it that the RES does to resolve those difficulties? Answer. All technologies for producing electricity have difficulties. Through regulation we need to handle these problems, whether they be proliferation, spent nuclear fuel, or greenhouse gases. I am optimistic that we can, save possible for proliferation. If we cannot prevent nations wanting nuclear weapons from getting then from a nuclear reactor program, we have to ask whether we could stop them from getting nuclear reactors. I do not think that we can. Thus, while I am concerned about proliferation, I do not see that there is much that we can do about it. President Carter stopped fuel reprocessing in order to present a model to other nations. Perhaps that worked for a time, but is not working now. The largest issue is going to be competition among the technologies for generating electricity. If nuclear power plants are cheapest for some regions, there is little that we will be able to do to stop other nations for building them. Question . If you expand the RES to push the development of sufficient nuclear power, and the problems currently preventing nuclear plant development are not resolved would not you then have an unworkable RES? Answer. If, as you suggest in question , we included nuclear and efficiency in the RPS and expanded its scope, and if nuclear proved to be non competitive, there would be greater difficulty in meeting the RPS. However, that would be the real world. If we are to lower greenhouse gas emissions, we need to find a combination of generation and efficiency that does not. Nuclear should be helpful, but if it isn't, we still need to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Question . If you don't expand the RES but include nuclear power and those problems are resolved, would this standard result in anything other than what was going to happen anyway? Would more new renewables be built? Answer. This question amplifies the previous two questions. The low carbon technologies should compete. If nuclear is the cheapest, it should dominate. The price of electricity is important for both consumers and business. If renewables are competitive, they will be deployed. If not, I am not clear why we ought to mandate their deployment. I want to qualify that statement in the sense that I want a portfolio of generation technologies. Fuel prices and environmental concerns change over time and so it is prudent to have a portfolio of generation technologies, even if one appears to be cheapest at this time. Responses of Lester B. Lave to Questions From Senator Murkowski Question . How much back up power from conventional power plants is needed to meet a % RPS requirement by ? At what cost? Answer. There would be almost no reduction in the need for backup capacity (dispatchable capacity) if there were a % RPS. The amount of generation capacity needed depends on the peak demand (with a margin for safety). Renewables would lower the amount of fossil, hydro, and nuclear generation capacity needed only insofar as they could be depended upon to generate power during the peak hours of the year. In most areas of the USA, peak demand occurs between and PM on the hottest summer day. That is generally a time when there is little wind. Although solar energy is high on those days, the sun is low enough to the horizon by PM that it is generating little electricity. Solar thermal arrays might be constructed to provide some generation during these periods by storing heat. Alternatively, if there were cheap bulk storage of electricity, wind and photovoltaic electricity could be stored for peak demand. However, with current technology, wind and solar would relieve little of the need for ``dispatchable'' capacity, capacity that the utility can depend upon to be available when they need it. A % RES would reduce the amount of fuel (coal or natural gas) required to generate electricity. However, since a gas turbine is generally used to fill in the momentary drop-offs in wind or solar generation, the fuel saved would be much less than %. Thus, there would be almost no savings in total investment in dispatchable plants and less than a proportional savings in fuel costs. Getting a realistic estimate of the cost of wind energy requires including the cost of backup or storage. Since wind farms and solar arrays have low capacity factors ( - % for wind and - % for solar), it would take . to units of wind capacity to replace on unit of nuclear capacity and . to units of solar capacity to replace on unit of nuclear capacity. For example, a solar array in New Jersey with a capacity factor of % would have to have nine times the capacity of a nuclear reactor to produce the same amount of electricity. A wind farm with a capacity factor of % would have to have three times the capacity of the nuclear reactor to produce the same amount of electricity. Thus, a , MW nuclear reactor produces as much electricity as , MW of solar cells in New Jersey or , MW of wind farms in Pennsylvania. Question . Do you agree that as it now stands, our country's transmission infrastructure is woefully inadequate to achieve a % by RPS requirement? Answer. Yes. The vast majority of the current transmission grid was built to transfer energy from the generators owned by a utility to its customers. Some transmission was built to interconnect utilities. Since restructuring began in , there has been little investment in transmission in restructured areas. Thus, the grid is not designed to get renewable energy from the best wind and solar sites to population centers. Massive investment in transmission would be needed to implement a % RES. Question . What are the estimated infrastructure costs to meet the legislation's requirement? How realistic is it to get the necessary transmission in place in time to meet the hard and fast deadlines of the national mandate? Should Congress build some flexibility into the program if inadequate transmission prevents compliance? Answer. The National Academy of Sciences ``America's Energy Future'' study deals with this question and should be available within two months. I have seen estimated costs for a modern grid that could accommodate renewables that exceed $ billion. A doctoral dissertation done a few years ago at Carnegie Mellon documented the difficulties in siting new transmission lines. Particularly in densely populated areas, there are formidable difficulties since few people want a transmission line on their property or close by. In the or energy legislation, Congress authorized the Secretary of Energy to designate national transmission corridors. I do not think that this designation has been terribly helpful in overcoming the objections to siting new transmission lines. There is considerable doubt that new lines can be sited to transmit the electricity to population centers. For example, Texas' requirement for renewables resulted in large investments in wind farms in the west, but it took some years to build the transmission to bring the electricity to market. Question . Given the different goals and definitions of renewable energy in the various state renewable energy standard programs, how does the majority staff draft ensure consistency and coordination of the state and federal programs? Answer. There is a vast, inconsistent array of definitions of renewable power among the states. For example, Pennsylvania includes electricity generated from waste coal piles. Some states have a solar set aside. Some states include methane from landfills. There is no uniformity across states; I don't see a possibility for coordination. A federal standard could set a minimum requirement that states could be free to supplement. My understanding is that the usual justification given for federal legislation overriding what states consider their prerogative is interstate commerce. However, Texas has essentially isolated its electricity grid from much of the nation and so there is little interstate commerce for electricity between Texas and the rest of the nation. Question . Do you agree that any federal RPS program must account for the regional variations in the supply of renewable resources? Answer. Renewable resources are not uniformly spread across the USA. The Northern Great Plains have the best wind resources, the desert Southwest has the best solar resources and the West has the best geothermal. The West generally has poor biomass resources because of low rainfall. A national RES would be punitively expensive if it doesn't allow a great deal of flexibility in how to meet the standard. I favor a carbon portfolio standard that would focus on the most important issue for electricity generation. I would include efficiency in that standard to give a region such as the Southeast with poor wind and solar resources an inexpensive way to comply. For example, California and New York State both use % less electricity per capita than the national average. They have achieved this efficiency with major expenditures and programs. If the Southeast could lower its electricity use by %, they would achieve more than twice the carbon- dioxide emissions reduction of a % RES. Question . Instead of a Renewable Portfolio Standard, you advocate the creation of a Carbon Portfolio Standard (CPS). How would something like that work? How would you treat energy efficiency under a CPS? Answer. I do favor a carbon portfolio standard. California has already created a model for this. They allow no more than a specified amount of carbon-dioxide to be emitted per megawatt-hour of generation. The standard can be met by renewables, by nuclear, or by fossil fuels with CCS. I would also allow the standard to be met by increased energy efficiency. That could be done by setting a standard for carbon-dioxide emissions due to electricity use per capita. Assume that the CPS called for a reduction of % of carbon-dioxide emissions. For a state that uses , kWh of electricity per capita per year, they could meet the standard by lowering carbon-dioxide in electricity generation or by lowering electricity use. For example, the state could lower electricity use by % to , kWh per capita and lower carbon- dioxide emissions per kWh by % in order to meet the standard. Question . How are the states doing in implementing their own RPS requirements? I understand that Massachusetts is behind, in part because the proposed wind farm off Cape Cod has yet to be built--and it's been under review for the past several years. Are the long-distance transmission lines needed to deliver the power, to meet the state requirements, being built? Answer. Massachusetts has been unable to meet its RPS until this year. Utilities were forced to buy renewable energy credits for about cents per kWh for their shortfall. States such as California and New York have set extremely ambitious RPS and it is far from certain that they will be able to attain them. Difficulties in siting wind farms and transmission lines have slowed the introduction of renewables. There has been little investment in transmission in the deregulated states. Question . Can you explain the problems with integrating intermittent renewable resources into the grid? It was just last February that the Texas grid was forced to shed load when the wind stopped blowing, dropping from MW to MW just as demand peaked. What kind of investments in transmission and storage do we need to make to ensure the reliability of renewable power? Answer. Both wind and solar resources are variable, meaning that the generation varies from minute to minute. To keep power quality high, investments are needed to fill in the generation gaps. For very short term variation, batteries, flywheels, and capacitors can be used. For variation that occurs over hours, generally gas turbines (or hydropower where available) are used. Prediction of wind and clouds has gotten better, but are far from perfect. There are recent experiences in Texas and Hawaii when unpredicted drop-offs in wind resulted in near blackouts because alternative generation could not be ramped up fast enough. The variation in wind and solar can be dampened by hooking in wind farms and solar arrays from distant sites. However, this is only a partial solution; a study done by GE for Texas found five days during April when there was essentially no wind energy available in Texas. To supply reliable, high quality power, the wind and solar generation must be backed up with a variety of quick acting and longer lasting instruments. For example, batteries, flywheels, and capacitors can be used to correct minute to minute variable while hydro or gas turned can be used to fill in generation shortfalls that are hours in duration. I cannot estimate the required investment in transmission, apart from the estimate of more than $ billion. The investment to overcome the minute to minute variability is about cent per kWh. Question . In your opinion, should Congress be trying to pick technology ``winners and losers'' with a national RPS? How can we best accommodate future technological innovation? Answer. No. An important lesson from the s is that government needs to decide which technologies to spend R&D money on, but should not pick which technologies should be implemented. Engineers and entrepreneurs should make that decision. I am a technological optimist and believe that better technologies will emerge over the next decade or so. Our research monies should support the development of these new technologies, but they should have to compete with other technologies for implementation. Question . Proponents of a national RPS insist the Southeast can meet the mandate through the use of biomass. Do you agree? Is this the best use for biomass, with its land limitations, or is this resource better used in transportation fuels? Answer. The Southeast has abundant biomass resources. There might be sufficient biomass to meet a % RPS. However, in a world with stringent greenhouse gas emissions constraints, we know how to produce electricity with little or no carbon emissions through hydro, nuclear, wind, solar, and fossil fuels with CCS. Producing liquid fuels for cars, aircraft, and ships is a much more difficult problem. Liquid fuels without carbon-dioxide emissions can be produced from biomass. In a carbon constrained world, we would want to devote biomass to producing liquid fuels, not to generating electricity. Response of Lester B. Lave to Question From Senator Landrieu Question . I know that we can achieve efficiency gains in both the interstate transmission of electricity as well as the retail distribution of electricity. In Sen. Bingaman's draft language that has been circulated, it only allows for savings from the retail distribution of electricity. Don't you think there are huge efficiency gains to be made through efficiency upgrades to our transmission backbone? Shouldn't that also be included in any efficiency portion of a RES? Answer. The usual estimate is that about % of electricity is lost in transmission and % in distribution. However, current transmission lines are relatively short. If we attempted to transmit power over long distances with today's relatively low voltage alternating current lines, transmission losses would be much greater. If we need to construct transmission to take wind from North Dakota to Florida, the cheapest, most efficient way to transmit electricity over long distances is with high voltage direct current lines. Building an infrastructure with HVDC lines would be expensive and time consuming because of siting objections. There would be substantial electricity lost even for these lines due to the distance. Responses of Lester B. Lave to Questions From Senator Sessions Question . What are we trying to achieve through a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES)? What are the goals? By focusing solely on renewables, are we limiting our options to achieve an adequate supply of clean, low-carbon, reliable and affordable electricity? Answer. People have different goals for an RES. The national interest would be served by lowering carbon-dioxide emissions, increasing environmental quality more generally, increasing sustainability and energy security, and by keeping electricity prices low enough not to have inordinate economic and personal penalties. Some people want an RES because they want to sell equipment that they make. Others support an RPS because they think they already know which technology is best at attaining these goals. I agree with the social objectives and think that equipment makers have the right to try to persuade people to buy their products. I do not see how someone could know what is the best technology to attain the social objectives at such an early stage of development of the technologies. Rather than focusing on a RES, I favor a carbon portfolio standard that includes energy efficiency. In my judgment, this approach would allow us to attain our social goals at least cost and with the least disruption. Question . If the main concern surrounding RES is to have clean energy then we should consider nuclear power. Nuclear power is produced in the United States, it has zero carbon dioxide emissions, and it does not put stress on agriculture products or the timber industry. Why has this source not been considered in the RES discussion? Answer. Senator, I agree that all sources of low carbon energy should be considered and allowed to compete. I do not know why nuclear has not been considered. Question . Why do you include energy sources that may yield some benefit in the future and do not have any short term benefits, but continue to exclude nuclear power that has both short term and long term benefits? Answer. Senator, respectfully, I would like nuclear to be able to compete to provide low carbon power to the nation. Question . The US consumes approximately gigawatts of electricity every year. The RES legislation would require approximately - gigawatts to come from renewable energy sources by . What percentage of the renewable energy mandate will be supplied by wind and why does wind have a larger potential than other renewable sources such as hydro or nuclear? Answer. Sir, the US electricity industry produced . million gigawatt-hours in . A federal RPS would require up to . million gigawatt-hours from renewables, if there were no efficiency gains. At this time, wind turbines in good wind locations are the least expensive way to generate a significant amount of additional renewable electricity. During the th century, we built a tremendous amount of hydroelectric capacity by damming major rivers. Few good locations remain to be exploited. Flooding large amounts of land behind high dams has major environmental impacts, as well as impeding fish migration. At this time, the nation is not building new major hydroelectric projects, but rather is breaching some dams. There are some ``run of the river'' hydro that could be developed and some ``low-head'' hydro on small rivers and streams, but the total amount of electricity that could be generated is relatively small. Geothermal generation, where there are good resources, can compete with wind. In some locations, solar thermal is almost competitive. Solar photovoltaic is much more expensive than current generation. Nuclear has vast potential for power generation, but the cost of power from new nuclear reactors is uncertain until we construct new plants. Thus, wind turbines in good locations offer the lowest cost electricity; there are much greater wind resources than other renewables, except solar. Thus, major develop of renewable resources has focused on wind. Question . In your opinion, how will the Southeast states meet their mandate requirements since wind is not a significant energy source in this region? Answer. The Southeast could meet an RES in three ways. It could use biomass in the form of trees, it could import wind energy from good locations, or it could buy renewable energy credits from areas that can more than meet the RES. Biomass is probably the cheapest alternative, unless the biomass is wanted for producing transportation fuels. Building long transmission lines will greatly increase the cost of delivered power. For example, we estimated that a , mile transmission line would double the delivered cost of power. Buying renewable energy credits would be limited by the ability of areas with good wind resources to absorb wind energy. For example, North Dakota has perhaps the best wind resources in the nation. However, there is very limited ability to absorb large amounts of wind generated electricity locally. As a practical matter, if more than - % of electricity is provided by wind, there would have to be major investment to buffer the variability of wind and to ramp up quickly when wind speeds dropped. There is a fourth alternative: Develop wind and solar generation where the resource is extremely limited. This would result in very costly power. Question . How will a RES affect the price of electricity in Southeast states? Answer. If biomass is available to meet the RES, electricity generation costs might rise by perhaps - %. If long transmission lines are built, the wholesale price of electricity in the Southeast is likely to double or more. If they are able to buy renewable energy credits, electricity prices will rise by cents per kWh. Responses of Lester B. Lave to Questions From Senator Corker Question . I was interested in the testimony you provided regarding biomass and the Renewable Fuel Standard. Could you discuss why you believe biomass is best suited for transportation fuel and not for an RES? Do you have any sense of what the available biomass resources are in the Southeast and approximately how much of those resources would be used for the RFS? If there are not enough biomass resources in the Southeast to meet the demands of both the RFS and RES, would an RES essentially force the Southeast to direct this renewable resource to the less efficient ``market'' or would the available biomass be used for the RFS, forcing the Southeast to comply with an RES through the purchase of credits or alternative compliance payments? Answer. Biomass could be used either for electricity generation or production of liquid transportation fuels. Since there are a variety of technologies for producing electricity with little or no carbon-dioxide emissions, biomass would not be terribly important for this use. In contrast, ethanol is the best source of liquid fuel for transportation without net carbon-dioxide emissions, assuming the ethanol comes from biomass, not corn. Thus, if large reductions in carbon-dioxide emissions are required, biomass would be used to produce ethanol, not electricity. If the Southeast were required to satisfy a % RPS and biomass was the cheapest way of doing it, biomass would be diverted from a higher use. The National Academy of Sciences ``America's Energy Future'' report will present the best estimates of biomass resources. Until then, a study from many of the National Labs estimates that - , million tons of biomass could be available for transformation into electricity or liquid fuels. The study gives details on the state by state biomass availability. Question . A federal RPS would dramatically increase wood demand and, as a consequence, increase prices on the forest products industry which relies upon affordable and reliable wood fiber. During these difficult economic times, such price increases would threaten good jobs in this industry, particularly in rural America. Is it true that a federal RES, as currently constructed, would drive up wood fiber costs and directly lead to job loss in the forest products industry? Answer. I am not an expert on the variety of jobs in the forest products industry. If the trees are being cut for fuel to generate electricity, there would be fewer jobs than if the trees are converted into liquid fuels. I conjecture that large scale tree farming with conversion of the biomass into liquid fuels would generate many jobs and substantial income in the Southeast. Responses of Lester B. Lave to Questions From Senator Mark Udall Question . Each region of the U.S. is blessed with excellent renewable resources. If wind power potential is not very good in the southeastern U.S., does that mean that utilities in that region of the country will be unable to provide their customers with electricity generated from renewable resources under a RES? Answer. The draft legislation allows a state to meet the federal RPS by buying renewable energy from another state or by buying renewable energy credits. If states in the Southeast found it too expensive to generate renewable electricity within their state, they could meet the requirement in the other two ways. The likely implication is that these states would have higher electricity prices than states with good wind resources. I would like to see greater flexibility in the legislation. I would tighten the definition of efficiency and remove, or at least lessen the cap. I would include all low or no-carbon generation in the definition. Of course, I would then raise the standard that each state would have to attain, given this more flexible definition. My point is that society needs to be clear on the goals that the legislation is seeking to achieve. In my judgment, reducing carbon- dioxide emissions and preserving reasonable low costs are the two most important goals. We have sufficient coal and uranium so that sustainability is not a first order concern. Energy security is not currently a first order concern since only % of electricity is generation from petroleum and we import substantial amounts of natural gas only from Canada. Congress and EPA should monitor environmental quality carefully and enact whatever legislation and standards are needed to ensure high environmental quality, particularly if we are mining and burning greater quantities of coal. For these reasons, I urge you to focus this legislation on the goals of lowering carbon dioxide emissions at a reasonable cost. Question . During the Bush Administration, the Energy Information Administration analyzed several different national RES legislative proposals. In each case, EIA determined that biomass would receive the most RES credits of any renewable technology eligible to receive credits. Please identify which regions of the country have the greatest biomass potential. Answer. The National Academy of Sciences ``America's Energy Future'' studies will present good estimates of biomass potential. Until the report is available, there is a report on biomass potential by a consortium of National labs. ______ Responses of Don Furman to Questions From Senator Bingaman Question . In your experience, are the multiple state standards able to produce a credit trading market that can generate a reasonably consistent national value for renewables credits? Answer. No. While there is a loose market of traded renewable credits, it is illiquid and highly inefficient. Each state defines renewable energy differently. In addition, certain states prohibit the use of RECs associated with renewable energy generated in other states to be used for compliance purposes, or place a different value on out- of-state RECs and in-state RECs. A consistent definition of eligible renewable energy and a nationwide trading platform--both of which would be achieved with the enactment of your RPS bill--is needed if we are going to be able to reap the full benefits of REC trading. Question . In our proposal we allow states implement their own standards that are stronger than the federal standard and to regulate what their utilities can do as far as selling excess federal credits, while not compelling them either to allow the sale or to disallow it. Does this, in your view, result in more renewables built and generated? Answer. Yes. The Bingaman RPS proposal would establish a national renewable energy floor but allow states to exceed that floor if they so choose. This will lead to greater amounts of renewable energy than if the Bingaman proposal preempted state opportunities to promote renewable energy. In addition, if a state that chooses to require its utilities to exceed the national requirement also requires those utilities to ``retire'' RECs that the utility won't need to comply with the national RPS instead of selling those credits to other utilities, this will lead to a greater amount of renewable generation because additional RECs will be required for national RPS compliance. Responses of Don Furman to Questions From Senator Murkowski Question . How much back up power from conventional power plants is needed to meet a % RPS requirement by ? At what cost? Answer. Because the issuance of renewable energy credits under the Bingaman RPS proposal is dependent on the generation of renewable electricity, no back up power from non-renewable power plants will be necessary to meet the RPS requirement. Some opponents of renewable energy argue that, for every installation of wind or solar power, utilities will need to build an equal amount of thermal power plants (generally fueled with natural gas) to provide power when the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining. This is a dramatic overstatement. We will need to build some additional thermal generation, as well as transmission, in order to accommodate a higher percentage of intermittent generation. However, the additional thermal generation required to support a given amount of wind or solar is a small fraction. This issue becomes less significant depending on the size of a particular utility control area. The broader the control area, the easier it is for utilities to manage plant outages without additional generating capacity. Equally important, with or without an RPS, utilities will need to build and acquire reserve generation capacity to address situations where conventional and non- conventional generation facilities are temporarily unavailable. Question . Do you agree that as it now stands, our country's transmission infrastructure is woefully inadequate to achieve a % by RPS requirement? Answer. Our country's transmission structure is inadequate with or without the enactment of a national RPS. NERC has on numerous occasions noted that substantial additions to transmission capacity are necessary if we are going to maintain the reliability of the grid. The additional investments needed to restore reliability will also allow utilities to manage intermittent generation, such as wind and solar, at much lower costs. Also, one of the benefits of an expanded grid is the ability to access some of the best renewable energy resources which are often located in remote regions of the country, some distance from load. Enhancing our transmission infrastructure would help lower the cost of compliance of a national RPS. Question . What are the estimated infrastructure costs to meet the legislation's requirement? How realistic is it to get the necessary transmission in place in time to meet the hard and fast deadlines of the national mandate? Should Congress build some flexibility into the program if inadequate transmission prevents compliance? Answer. It is not possible to provide an estimate of the investment in transmission infrastructure that would be necessary to meet the RPS' requirement because there is no particular level of transmission infrastructure that would be required to meet the RPS. The same response applies to the request for the time deadline for having the transmission infrastructure in place. Additional transmission infrastructure will help reduce the compliance costs of the RPS but utilities will not necessarily be left without compliance options if transmission is not built. The Bingaman proposal already provides flexibility to utilities by enabling them to make an alternative compliance payment if they aren't able to generate/acquire renewable energy or renewable energy credits that are more cost effective. Question . Given the different goals and definitions of renewable energy in the various state renewable energy standard programs, how does the majority staff draft ensure consistency and coordination of the state and federal programs? Answer. The Bingaman proposal would require the Secretary of Energy to, the maximum extent practicable, facilitate coordination between the Federal RPS program and state RPS programs. The lack of consistency between state RPS programs is one of the reasons we need a Federal RPS to ensure a consistent national approach but would also allow states to impose additional requirements on their utilities. Question . Do you agree that any federal RPS program must account for the regional variations in the supply of renewable resources? Answer. As long as the definition of ``renewable energy'' is as broad as it is in Senator Bingaman's RPS proposal, each region of the country would be able to comply with a national RPS. Some opponents of a national RPS have attempted to portray the Southeastern United States as being disadvantaged because wind resources in the Southeast are not optimal. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the Energy Information Administration has repeatedly found, biomass, not wind, would generate the most renewable energy credits under a RPS and the Southeast has substantial biomass resources and also has a reasonable amount of solar power potential. Question . Wind energy had a record year least year, installing over , megawatts of new generating capacity on line and bringing domestic wind capacity to , megawatts. Given the various federal incentives we provide for the wind industry, from R&D funding, the Production Tax Credit, the CREBS program, and the new loan guarantee program created in the stimulus package, to name just a few, why does the wind industry need a federal Renewable Portfolio Standard? Answer. To date, the Federal government has chosen to incent renewable electricity production primarily through the tax code. Although the renewable production tax credit (PTC) has been successful it has also produced a great amount of uncertainty because the PTC has never been extended on a long-term basis. As a result, U.S. investment in manufacturing capability has fallen far behind the rest of the world, and at least half the equipment installed is manufactured overseas. The recent collapse of the tax equity market--which many renewable energy developers had utilized to monetize the PTC--has added even more uncertainty. Renewable energy developers need a more stable public policy approach. The RPS provides more long-term certainty by establishing a market for renewable energy over a reasonable period of time. It will also provide the certainty to cause investors to build manufacturing facilities in the U.S., employing Americans and saving consumers money. Question a. You highlight last year's Department of Energy report that determined wind could produce up to % of the nation's power by . The DOE report found that in order to reach a % level, we would need , megawatts of wind generation--an % increase in wind power capacity. How much of this would have to be off-shore wind since, as you know, we still don't have any off-shore wind in this country? Answer. The continental U.S. has more than enough potential to meet the GW target for wind energy which the DOE has estimated to be feasible. Off-shore wind could play a role, but it is not necessary. Question b. Is the lack of adequate transmission another impediment? How much transmission would we need to accommodate a % level of wind power? Answer. The lack of sufficient transmission capacity was one of the barriers identified in the DOE report. According to DOE, $ billion in transmission will be needed to satisfy the % target. If this investment is made, many regions of the country would gain access to less expensive renewable and non-renewable generation. It is also important to point out that much of the $ billion investment needs to be made anyway, to increase reliability and reduce congestion. Both transmission congestion and reliability concerns cost the economy billions of dollars per year. Question c. A new study undertaken by MISO, PJM, SPP, the SERC Reliability Region, and TVA found that in order to get % of our nation's electricity by , we would need to upgrade our transmission system at a cost of $ billion, and the wind turbines needed to generate that power would cost almost $ billion. Do you agree with this assessment? If not, why not? Answer. I haven't yet reviewed the entire study. However, I understand the study concluded that this investment would save consumers in the Eastern U.S. approximately $ billion per year. As I noted earlier, investments in transmission infrastructure offer consumers significant benefits that need to be taken into account when assessment whether such investments should be made. Question . You testified that a national RPS will provide a direct signal to the market place that will drive renewable energy development and eventually obviate the need for the Production Tax Credit. At what point do you see that happening? If we adopt a national Renewable Portfolio Standard, do we really need to continue the PTC? Shouldn't it be one or the other? Answer. If a national RPS is enacted and it is robust enough to encourage investment in new renewable energy generating capacity, I believe it would be appropriate to phase-out the PTC. Given that each national RPS that has been proposed contains a ramp-up mechanism, it will be important to ensure that the national renewable target has ramped-up sufficiently to incent enough demand in renewable energy to negate further need for the PTC. Question . I understand from your testimony that you do not support the inclusion of energy efficiency as a potential resource to meet even a small portion of the RPS standard. Rather than set a completely separate energy efficiency standard, as you propose, isn't there a way to make energy efficiency work in the context of an RPS? Answer. It is very easy to determine when a kwh of renewable energy has been generated. However, it is much more difficult to calculate when a specific action has reduced a kwh of energy demand. That is why, although I believe energy efficiency should be strongly encouraged and should be our nation's highest priority, a portfolio standard approach is not the best public policy approach for achieving energy efficiency. I am concerned that the energy efficiency provisions contained in the Bingaman bill could reward credits that don't actually achieve specific energy savings. Question . As drafted, Chairman Bingaman's draft provides for some exemptions such as those utilities with retail sales of less than million megawatt-hours and taking hydropower out of the baseline calculation. What don't you support these exemptions? With regard to hydropower, are you actually advocating the displacement of this clean, renewable, base load generation? I don't support or oppose these exemptions. I simply noted in my testimony that, if these exemptions are included, it is important that the RPS standard be set higher to take into account the reductions in renewable energy generation due to these exemptions. Question . In your written testimony, you contend that our electric generating sector has become ``dangerously reliant'' on natural gas and that domestic supply is ``unlikely'' to keep pace with demand. But the facts seem to tell another story. We used natural gas to generate just over % of our electricity last year. Roughly % of that gas was produced here in the United States, and about % was produced in North America. It also appears that we have more than enough natural gas to facilitate the generation you mentioned. EIA recently announced the largest-ever increase in its estimate of domestic reserves. Looking forward, EIA has projected that consumption will increase by an average of . % per year through --with imports accounting for just % of total consumption that year. And, a significant boost in supply is expected to come from my home state, Alaska, which is making progress on a natural gas pipeline that will transport billion cubic feet per day. Can you explain then, why you see natural gas as an unacceptable resource for electric generation? Answer. I don't view natural gas as an unacceptable resource for electric generation. In fact, Iberdrola Renewables owns several gas- fired electric generation facilities. I also believe that natural gas will be a critical component of our energy supply going forward. I am concerned, however, with our growing reliance on natural gas-fired capacity and with a return to the trend of the s where virtually all new electric generation was natural gas-fired. The demand for natural gas in the electric generation sector has increased by approximately percent over the last years. Outside of wind, almost all of the new generating capacity built over the last several years is powered by natural gas and that trend is expected to continue into the future--especially if Congress restricts greenhouse gas emissions without adopting additional policies aimed at increasing renewable generation. It may very well be that new domestic sources of natural gas, including those located in Alaska will help limit natural gas imports. However, we also could experience a significant increase in the demand for gas in the transportation, electric generation, industrial, agriculture and home heating sectors. It is important to remember that EIA's forecast does not assume the imposition of restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, I think it is important to note that T. Boone Pickens believes we need to substantially reduce the use of natural gas in the electric generation sector in order to enable the increased use of gas for transportation in order to reduce our reliance on foreign imports of oil. Response of Don Furman to Question From Senator Landrieu Question . I know that we can achieve efficiency gains in both the interstate transmission of electricity as well as the retail distribution of electricity. In Sen. Bingaman's draft language that has been circulated, it only allows for savings from the retail distribution of electricity. Don't you think there are huge efficiency gains to be made through efficiency upgrades to our transmission backbone? Shouldn't that also be included in any efficiency portion of a RES? Answer. We can and should make improvements to the transmission grid that result in fewer losses associated with the transportation of electricity. The Federal government should certainly encourage these improvements. The Bingaman RPS proposal rewards efficiency in the distribution of electricity but not necessarily the interstate transmission of electricity. If there is going to be an energy efficiency standard, it might be appropriate to include transmission efficiency. However, as I noted in my testimony, I don't support the inclusion of an efficiency component in a national RPS because it is too difficult to actually measure energy savings attributable to specific actions. Responses of Don Furman to Questions From Senator Sessions Question . What are we trying to achieve through a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES)? What are the goals? By focusing solely on renewables, are we limiting our options to achieve an adequate supply of clean, low-carbon, reliable and affordable electricity? Answer. The national RPS should be designed to encourage the development of a domestic renewable energy industry. This will enable the renewable energy industry to make a major contribution to our national economy, energy security and our goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, other policies will also be necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We often hear from opponents of a national RPS that nuclear power should be eligible for credits. However, it is highly unlikely, given how long it will be before we see the next generation of nuclear power plants placed in service, that new nuclear power facilities can be a major contributor to our generation portfolio in the near term. That is why we aren't seeing the nuclear industry push for the inclusion of nuclear in a RPS. Question . If the main concern surrounding RES is to have clean energy then we should consider nuclear power. Nuclear power is produced in the United States, it has zero carbon dioxide emissions, and it does not put stress on agriculture products or the timber industry. Why has this source not been considered in the RES discussion? Answer. See response to Question . Question . Why do you include energy sources that may yield some benefit in the future and do not have any short term benefits, but continue to exclude nuclear power that has both short term and long term benefits? Answer. See response to Question . Question . The US consumes approximately gigawatts of electricity every year. The RES legislation would require approximately - gigawatts to come from renewable energy sources by . What percentage of the renewable energy mandate will be supplied by wind and why does wind have a larger potential than other renewable sources such as hydro or nuclear? Answer. The Energy Information Administration, in analyzing previous RPS proposals, has consistently concluded that biomass will provide more renewable energy generation than wind in order to meet a national RPS requirement. Incremental hydropower capacity would be eligible to be used for RPS compliance but most experts don't anticipate a significant amount of incremental hydropower potential. Question . In your opinion, how will the Southeast states meet their mandate requirements since wind is not a significant energy source in this region? Answer. The Energy Information Administration has determined that utilities in the Southeastern U.S. would have access to significant amounts of biomass energy as well as the ability to import wind power generated in nearby states in order to meet a national RPS requirement. Question . How will a RES affect the price of electricity in Southeast states? Answer. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, consumers in the southeast will experience a reduction in their energy bills of $ billion if Congress adopts Congressman Markey's % by national RPS. The reason for this reduction is that a national RPS will reduce the demand for natural gas for electric generation which will reduce both electric generation prices and the price of natural gas used for home heating and cooking. Responses of Don Furman to Questions From Senator Mark Udall Question . Each region of the U.S. is blessed with excellent renewable resources. If wind power potential is not very good in the southeastern U.S., does that mean that utilities in that region of the country will be unable to provide their customers with electricity generated from renewable resources under a RES? Answer. The Energy Information Administration has determined that utilities in the Southeastern U.S. would have access to significant amounts of biomass energy as well as the ability to import wind power generated in nearby states in order to meet a national RPS requirement. Question . During the Bush Administration, the Energy Information Administration analyzed several different national RES legislative proposals. In each case, EIA determined that biomass would receive the most RES credits of any renewable technology eligible to receive credits. Please identify which regions of the country have the greatest biomass potential. Answer. The Southeast and the Midwest have the greatest biomass potential and each region would benefit greatly if a national RPS is enacted. Question . If the U.S. were to generate up to % of its power from renewable resources, how would this impact our country's reliance on natural gas to generate electricity? Answer. Every credible study that has analyzed the impact of a national RPS has concluded that the RPS would significantly reduce the demand for natural gas in the electric generation sector. Question . If the country switches to plug-in hybrids to power our automobiles and also adopts a % national RES, what would the impact be on oil and gas imports over the next years? Answer. Oil imports would be dramatically reduced because plug-in hybrids will require substantially less oil than conventional vehicles. In addition, if a national RES is enacted, plug-in hybrid batteries could very well be recharged with electricity generated with renewable resources which would then reduce our nation's demand for natural gas. The reduced demand for oil and gas should translate into significant reductions in imports. ______ Responses of Scott P. Jones to Questions From Senator Murkowski Question . How much back-up power from conventional power plants is needed to meet a % percent RPS requirement by ? At what cost? Question . Do you agree that as it now stands, our country's transmission infrastructure is woefully inadequate to achieve a percent RPS requirement by ? Question . What are the estimated infrastructure costs to meet the legislation's requirement? How realistic is it to get the necessary transmission in place in time to meet the hard and fast deadlines of the national mandate? Should Congress build some flexibility into the program if inadequate transmission prevents compliance? Question . Given the different goals and definitions of renewable energy in the various state renewable energy standard programs, how does the majority staff draft ensure consistency and coordination of the state and federal programs? Answer. Staff can ensure consistency and coordination of the state and federal programs by incorporating existing programs, such as the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program and programs initiated and implemented by the Farm Bill. Question . Do you agree that any federal RPS program must account for the regional variations in the supply of renewable resources? Answer. We would agree that any federal RPS program must account for regional variations in sources and supplies of renewable energy resources. We believe that wood is necessary to meet a Renewable Electricity Standard. In a mosaic of energy sources, where each region of the country produces energy from its own, best indigenous resources, we seek a level playing field for wood. This level field of play will bring the same jobs and new local tax bases to forested regions as other regions will potentially enjoy. But, we have deep concern that, under developing renewable energy markets, forestland may be disproportionately burdened by well-meaning but functionally stifling regulation, relative to other renewable energy sources and their land bases. Simple acknowledgements of the impracticality of applying agricultural principles to forestry is a small step in the right direction; for example, the seasonal-crop, closed-loop approach to energy feedstocks just has no place in dealing with a crop that can take decades to culture, i.e., trees. The negative impacts of national energy policies could create harm to all family forestlands in the U.S. Wood is a reliable feedstock, without the seasonal fluctuations or serendipity of weather that inhibit some other energy sources. And this resource (wood) is available now. Question . In your testimony, you state that ``forest practice policies are better determined at the local level to account for differences in local conditions and needs, rather than through prescriptive, one-size-fits-all federal mandates.'' Doesn't the same hold true for a national Renewable Portfolio Standard requirement where states are in a better position to develop programs that account for the differences in available resources? Answer. The majority of our forests are owned by private forest landowners. Therefore, we have many individuals and companies working across this country to maintain healthy, working forests. In certain regions, we have state policy to offer guidance but in the majority of the country we have state developed and monitored ``best management practices''. These voluntary guidelines assist landowners in the management of their forests to have minimal impact on water quality and various other aspects of the land. Since we have variations of species composition, Boreal forests in Alaska, spruce and fir in the Pacific Northwest, southern yellow pine in the Southeast, ponderosa pine in the Southwest, and hardwoods in the Appalachians and Northeast, we are presented with a variety of specific needs that can only be addressed properly at the local level. If and how this would apply to energy production in the United States is unclear to us at this time. However, we do believe that each region should be allowed to utilize the renewable resources that they have in order to meet any renewable goals that might be set at the state or national level. Question . You note in your testimony that your members look forward to participating in the new markets created by new national RPS requirements, so could the RPS policy be a money-making proposition for your members? How do you propose to balance forest sustainability issues with the new market demands? Answer. In short, yes, landowners do stand to benefit from the new markets for woody biomass that will result from a national RES. That being said, it is important to understand the basic economics of managing and maintaining a stand of timber, as well as the relative value of all of the products removed from the forest. In order to receive an acceptable return on investment (ROI) from a timberland investment, trees must be grown to their highest potential value. In most cases, this means growing trees long enough to be able to sell the timber for sawlogs and veneer. As part of this process, and in order to maintain a healthy, productive forest, timber stands must be thinned of poorer quality, less vigorous trees in order to free up the site resources for the better quality trees. In order to perform these thinning treatments, adequate markets must exist to be able to have an economically viable timber harvest of this material. Woody biomass for energy consumption, which will likely consist of smaller diameter trees, limbs, and tops removed during these thinning operations represent the lowest value product removed from the forest as well as the lowest percentage of overall income per acre during any specific harvest. It is highly unlikely the energy markets created by a National RES will drive a landowner's harvest and management decisions. The higher value sawlogs will still be a requirement to justify a reasonable return on a timberland investment. As such, the same laws, standards, and protections that currently apply to all timber harvests across the nation and in all states will still provide the same level of protection. Otherwise: In January , the New York Times headline read, ``TIMBER FAMINE NEAR, SAYS PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT''. The article said that ``` . . . this country is in peril of a timber famine . . . ' as asserted by the President this afternoon in an address before the American Forest Congress. In the course of his remarks the President said: `If the present rate of forest destruction is allowed to continue, a timber famine is obviously inevitable. Fire, wasteful and destructive forms of lumbering, and legitimate use are together destroying our forest resources far more rapidly than they are being replaced . . . Unless the forests can be made ready to meet the vast demands which . . . growth will inevitably bring, commercial disaster is inevitable.''[ ] Here are the words straight from the Times. I think this forcefully makes the case for sustainability. Remember, pulpwood was non-existent when this quote was made, as Charles Herty ( -- ) had not yet invented the pulping process. Only when we planted trees and encouraged markets did we end our brush with a timber famine. The destructive form of lumbering, then, was a process that is still called ``high grading'' trees, today. Because at that time, only a high quality part of the tree was considered valuable for lumber, and the rest of the tree was left in the woods to rot or was burned. The point here is: markets cured the ``timber famine''. Forest management for commodities did that. New markets did not create sustainability problems; they cured them. Question . As you know, proponents of a national RPS point to biomass as the sole renewable resource available to meet the percent by requirement. Do you believe that the Southeast has enough biomass to meet a percent requirement and still fulfill demand for other wood products such as pulpwood and saw logs? Answer. This is not an easy question to answer, but it is safe to say that in the Southeast, percent of the `` percent requirement'' would not have to originate from forest biomass. It is also safe to say that forests in the U.S. South are accumulating significantly more woody biomass than is currently consumed annually and have done so for decades; indicating excess availability of woody biomass to meet new demand. Some of the contemplated legislation has considered efficiency as a possible contributor. There are also many other forms of biomass available to help meet the standards such as mill residues and byproducts, urban wood, nursery and right-of-way trimmings, agriculture wastes, timber from salvage operations, storm debris, clean construction waste, etc. There are, although in much smaller quantities, other available renewable resources such as some possible solar opportunity in Florida, a small amount of geothermal in Louisiana and Arkansas, and potentially, with eased political pressures, some untapped hydros. All in all, biomass will still make up the dominant proportion of renewable energy in the Southeast, but the availability of these other options must be assessed to accurately reflect the percent of renewable energy that will ultimately come from biomass. In the United States as a whole, similar to southeastern statistics, timber growth has exceeded the harvests since . Growing-stock volume on U.S. timberland has increased percent between and . That is, the nation's forest inventory accrued more volume than it lost by mortality and harvest by over one-third [ ]. You may hear that adding a new RES market to existing markets will create an unsustainable resource. It is simply not true. We do not have enough markets for the wood that we are growing, as shown in the USDA Forest Service's Resource Planning Act (RPA) data collected by the Forest Inventory Analysis program. The data showed that across all species in the United States, we were growing percent more volume then we removed [ ]. Now, with the reduction of forest products manufacturing, we have seen an increase in the amount of growth versus removal. The RPA data shows a percent volume grown over removal [ ]. The impact of the reduction of our forest products manufacturing is having a clear effect on the amount of wood being grown and the threat to the health of our forests and private forest landowners is eminent. We believe arguments to the contrary are likely disingenuous and perhaps more motivated by competition for raw materials, and/or feedstock preferences, and/or tax avoidance than resource sustainability. The forest resource is sustainable and this question has been asked and answered before. But, the willingness of forest landowners to maintain forestland as forestland has had too little attention. Federal forest policy must address the conundrum of what would motivate a forest landowner to continue to hold that investment when it is threatened by new and evolving forces; whether it is opportunities for better financial returns for their families, shrinking market access, or investment-dampening legislation and regulation. Question . What are the transportation expenses associated with woody biomass? I understand that because transporting biomass is expensive, it is more likely to be used only near existing coal-fired power plants or in plants especially built for biomass. Is that correct? Answer. Woody biomass is expensive to transport long distances. This is typically a function of the density of the biomass material and the moisture. Biomass (woodchips, needles, bark, sawdust, etc.) is usually loosely packed in a truck, therefore the amount of energy being transported per unit measure (ton, cubic foot, etc.) is much less than other fuels used to produce electricity. With regard to moisture, for every percent of moisture, it will take some of the Btu value of the biomass to evaporate that water, thus ``stripping'' some Btus away from the production of energy. Thus, the dryer and denser the material can be, typically, the further the material can be economically hauled. Due to this, it is advantageous to locate the consuming facility as close to the biomass source as possible. This is typically assumed to be within to miles of the consuming facility. Question . Professor Lave notes that biomass is hampered by land limitations and that biomass is better used for transportation fuels. You've noted that forestlands are being converted to other uses at a rapid rate. Do you agree that biomass is better used for transportation fuels instead of electricity production? Answer. Where available and economically feasible, all raw materials can and should be used as sources for energy production, whatever the form of energy produced. Some feedstocks may be more economical regionally, and the market will determine that. But, the markets will make those determinations; hopefully with some initial stimulus to jumpstart these new alternative energy production opportunities. Question . You noted that the definition of ``renewable biomass'' included in the Energy Independence and Security Act has excluded America's natural private forest landowners from ``participation in the initiative to establish a renewable fuels industry.'' How would you change the definition of biomass in the Renewable Fuels Standard to ensure your members can participate in these new markets and to slow the conversation of natural forest on private lands to housing tracts? Do you think southeast states would be able to meet their mandated requirements if they are not allowed to use woody biomass to generate electricity? Answer. Healthy working forests, either naturally or artificially regenerated, are dependent on viable, sound markets in which to sell timber. Without markets, the economic justification of keeping land in a forested state is lessened or completely disappears. Developing as broad a definition as possible, with the inclusion of the whole tree and all tree parts regardless of their natural or artificial origin, would be the most complete way of assuring that landowners have the optimal opportunity to continue to manage their forests as forests and does not heap disincentives on an endeavor that is currently burdened by external pressures to convert from forestland to other land uses. The willingness of forest landowners to maintain forestland as forestland has had too little attention. Federal forest policy must address the conundrum of what would motivate a forest landowner to continue to hold that investment when it is threatened by new and evolving forces; whether it is opportunities for better financial returns for their families, shrinking market access, or investment- dampening legislation and regulation. Urbanization will have the ``most direct, immediate and permanent'' effects on southern forests of all forces of change [ ]. The incentives for forest landowners to convert forestland investments to residential and commercial real estate are led by population growth. U.S. Census Bureau [ ] population growth projections between the years and are for . million new people. That is a . percent growth, and most of that growth will be in the regions heavily dominated by private forest ownership [ ]. How will this growth affect forestland use? We are distinguishing-- again, throughout this testimony--between sustainable forestland, sustainable forest resources, and that without the land there can be no resources. Nineteen million acres of forest converted to developed uses from to in the Southeast [ ]. The need for homes, churches, public infrastructure, and other services of st century human existence will cause fragmentation of forested landscapes, which will have its greatest impact in the Southeast [ ], the region with the highest concentration of family forestland, but with a lack of other regional sources of renewable energy other than forests. And private, family forest landowners who manage smaller tracts of land are at greater potential for development [ ]. Traditional markets for forest commodities are trending offshore or are impacted by poor trade policy. For example, as fewer and fewer pulp/paper mills remain in this country, production has remained unchanged--or slightly improved--but, geographic distribution and access to those markets has degenerated: pulp and/or paper mills closed, ' --' (none have been built since ) [ ] softwood sawmills closed in the U.S. & Canada, ' --' [ ] furniture plants closed, ' --' (hardwood indicator) [ ] In legislation and regulation, if we are truly to meet renewable energy goals (whether electricity or biofuels), wood must be allowed to make its full contribution. Some well-meaning organizations want renewable energy, but want to dictate which forests can participate. Currently, percent of our nation's private forestland is natural [ ]. In the southeastern United States, on private lands, percent of forestland is natural [ ]. However, with the current definition of ``renewable biomass'' for the Renewable Fuels Standard of the Energy Independence and Security Act (at its most restrictive), America's natural private forestlands are excluded from participation in the initiative to establish a renewable fuels industry. This kind of policy creates disincentives for private forest landowners to continue to hold and manage their forestlands. Anecdotally, we know that this language has already resulted in acres and acres of tree removals for conversion to other land uses. This same definition will result, we believe, in land dedicated to fuel production at the expense of other traditional markets. In order to promote the continuation of sustainably managed forests on private lands, we must encourage markets for these landowners; voluntary markets. No definition that harms capital investment in energy facilities or taints the siting of those facilities can benefit the future of America's forestlands. Without broad, inclusive definitions for woody biomass, we are only encouraging the loss of private forestlands to other uses that typically are less environmentally friendly. So, our growing population leads to conversion. Fewer markets and less market access leads to conversion. And the constraints of new laws lead to conversion. The message is that constraints on the resource lead to conversion of forestland to other uses. How can one argue that disincentives to keep an investment--in this instance, privately held forestland--improve the likelihood of it continuance or its sustainability? Then, it is in the best interest of all who want to maintain a forested America to seek out incentives for forest landowners. The highest current concern to these landowners regards the definition of ``woody biomass'' in statute and regulation. That is, woody biomass should be defined as ``wood'' in addition to wood residues, wastes, and/or byproducts. Ultimately, we must sustainably harvest trees as pulpwood, sawtimber, poles, pilings, chip-n-saw, OSB, wafferboard, and ``energy-wood.'' Landowners would like to see wood as an equal partner with grains, grasses, and all cellulosic feedstocks. references [ ] Wear and Greis, USDA Forest Service, Southern Forest Resource Assessment.

Jones to Questions From Senator Sessions Question . What are we trying to achieve through a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES)? What are the goals? By focusing solely on renewables, are we limiting our options to achieve an adequate supply of clean, low-carbon, reliable, and affordable electricity? If the main concern surrounding RES is to have clean energy, then we should consider nuclear power. Nuclear power is produced in the United States, it has zero carbon dioxide emissions, and it does not put stress on agriculture products or the timber industry. Why has this source not been considered in the RES discussion? Answer. If an RES, an RPS, or any other energy provision, act, or package is passed by Congress, all sources of domestic energy feedstock are needed and should be used. But, please allow a correction to the implication that stress will be put on the timber industry. You may hear that adding a new RES market to existing markets will create an unsustainable resource. It is simply not true. We do not have enough markets for the wood that we are growing, as shown in the USDA Forest Services Resource Planning Act (RPA) data collected by the Forest Inventory Analysis program. The data showed that across all species in the United States, we were growing percent more volume then we removed [ ]. Now, with the reduction of forest products manufacturing, we have seen an increase in the amount of growth versus removal. The RPA data shows a percent volume grown over removal [ ]. The impact of the reduction of our forest products manufacturing is having a clear effect on the amount of wood being grown and the threat to the health of our forests and private forest landowners is eminent. We believe arguments to the contrary are likely disingenuous and perhaps more motivated by competition for raw materials, and/or feedstock preferences, and/or tax avoidance than resource sustainability. The forest resource is sustainable and this question has been asked and answered before. But, the willingness of forest landowners to maintain forestland as forestland has had too little attention. Federal forest policy must address the conundrum of what would motivate a forest landowner to continue to hold that investment when it is threatened by new and evolving forces; whether it is opportunities for better financial returns for their families, shrinking market access, or investment- dampening legislation and regulation. Question . Why do you include energy sources that may yield some benefit in the future and do not have any short-term benefits, but continue to exclude nuclear power that has both short-and long-term benefits? Question . The US consumes approximately , gigawatts of electricity every year. The RES legislation would require approximately to gigawatts to come from renewable energy sources by . What percentage of the renewable energy mandate will be supplied by wind and why does wind have a larger potential than other renewable sources such as hydro or nuclear? Question . In your opinion, how will the southeastern states meet their mandate requirements since wind is not a significant energy source in this region? Answer. The southeastern states will need to tap their most plentiful renewable resource, woody biomass. However, this will not happen unless a broad definition of renewable biomass is enacted. Question . How will a RES affect the price of electricity in southeastern states? Answer. As with all renewable technologies, renewable power production is more expensive than current base load or peaking capacity. Thus, it can be expected that ultimately, any mandated renewable power mandate will increase the cost of electricity to the rate payer. However, the advantage of biomass energy is that biomass produces the least expensive power of all available and viable renewable technologies; is base load, meaning it produces power all the time as opposed to intermittently like wind and solar; and happens to be the South's most abundant renewable resource. Biomass, in general, has unique attributes among other renewable energy sources: it can be burned in existing coal-fired power production with relatively minor and inexpensive modifications; and it can be generated whenever the biomass developer or utility chooses. references [ ] Forest Resources of the United States, . Gen. Tech Rep. NC- , Table [ ] Forest Resources of the United States, . Gen. Tech Rep. NC-xxx, Table (with permission from Greg Reams, National Program Manager, F.I.A.) Responses of Scott P. Jones to Questions From Senator Mark Udall Question . How important are markets for woody-biomass, such as the one that could be created by the RES, in addressing forest health threats including insects, disease, and wildfire, not only in Colorado, but across the nation? Answer. Healthy forests and strong markets go hand in hand. As a part of maintaining and managing a forest, intermittent treatments to remove poor quality material, dead or dying material as a result of disease or insects, reducing fuel loads such as smaller diameter understory, etc. becomes necessary. The justification for a private landowner to be able to perform these treatments means that it must be economically viable, thus either break even or generate a profit. Any additional profit generated by the landowner will create cashflow that can then be use to meet other landowner objectives, often times putting money back into the land via establishing the ``next'' forest. Question . By removing woody biomass in responding to forest health threats and utilizing it towards renewable energy goals, what types of activities can landowners take to ensure their lands continue to be managed sustainably? Answer. Private forests are already regulated extensively via the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, state mandatory and voluntary programs such as BMPs and state administered forest harvesting laws, cooperative agreements, and the like. All of these aim at maintaining the values that we deem as important from our nations private forests, such as clean air, water, protection of wildlife, recreation, aesthetics, etc. These standards apply to all harvesting removals from the forest, regardless of the type of product removed, and will undoubtedly apply to the removal of woody biomass for energy. Continued operation under this vast array of protections should continue to provide the same level of protection currently enjoyed. Appendix II Additional Material Submitted for the Record ---------- Statement of KeLa Energy KeLa Energy appreciates the opportunity to share our perspective on Chairman Bingaman's proposal for a national Renewable Electricity Standard or RES. Our company strongly supports policy efforts promoting use of renewable energy and we believe that our technology can help the nation achieve the renewable energy objectives specified in the Chairman's proposal. KeLa has patented an environmentally preferable fuel technology that blends waste products that currently have very few end markets and combines these wastes with renewable biomass to form a solid fuel that produces numerous energy and environmental benefits. The blended product can be used by electric utilities to generate power or by industrial users to fire boilers for combined heat and power systems and other applications. The components of the fuel are: Waste Carpet: carpet that is pulled from homes and businesses during demolition and renovation that would otherwise be destined for land disposal. Currently, landfills receive between and billion pounds of carpet annually. Recycled Plastics: plastic material diverted from landfills. Consumer and industrial waste--including difficult to handle mixed-stream plastics, plastic bottles, trays and other materials. Renewable, Carbon Neutral Biomass: saw dust and wood residuals (bark, limbs, trimmings) from sustainable forestry operations. Coal Fines: these so-called fines are just that--coal particles that separate from already-mined coal during transportation or preparation that are too small to process and lay in piles at impoundment sites. Currently, over billion tons of coal fines are resting in impoundment sites with million tons added every year. The waste carpet and recycled plastics serve as binding agents for the coal fines and biomass. The end product is a pellet that resembles coal but with many enhanced performance characteristics: Considerably higher ( percent) BTU value compared to coal Quick ignition producing less smoke on start-up than coal Combusts efficiently with far less unburned carbon in ash than coal ( % v. %) Resists moisture so it can be stored outside In addition to enhanced performance, the fuel produces important emissions reduction benefits. KeLa fuel reduces carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by almost percent compared to coal. Sulfur emissions are reduced by percent. Our certified test burns also demonstrate lower nitrogen oxide (NO X ) emissions, lower volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and reduced emissions of hazardous air pollutants. These benefits are delivered utilizing fines from coal that has already been mined, maximizing efficient use of the resource. In addition, the blended product can substitute for coal in the fuel delivery and combustion systems of existing boilers without equipment modification. The draft RES currently under consideration acknowledges traditional sources of renewable energy. We are concerned that this approach may risk excluding emerging fuel technologies like KeLa that blend renewable energy sources with waste diverted material to produce fuel that will help meet the legislation's objectives We understand that a fuel comprised of renewable and waste diverted components may not compare to virtual emissions-free performance that wind and solar technologies boast. However, wind and solar capacity is not prevalent in every region in the country. Moreover, the reduced emissions and efficiency benefits that have been demonstrated in our test burns are real and suggest that this fuel and others like it could serve as a critical bridge technology that will facilitate movement toward a green energy economy. As the Committee begins the process of further refining the RES proposal, we respectfully request that clarifying language be added to the bill that will allow emerging fuel technologies like ours to qualify in a national renewable electricity standard. We thank the committee for creating an opportunity to comment on this important issue and look forward to working with you in the coming months to craft a workable and balanced renewable energy policy. ______ Statement of Plum Creek Timber Company introduction Plum Creek Timber Company is pleased to submit these comments to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources regarding the proposal for a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES). Plum Creek owns approximately . million acres of forest land in states and is the nation's largest owner of private land and the largest seller of wood fiber. Plum Creek was also the first forest land owner to have its lands nationwide certified as sustainably managed under a third party program. Plum Creek believes that woody biomass from forests can make an important contribution to the nation's renewable energy goals if allowed to do so, and should be provided equitable treatment with other feedstocks and renewable energy technologies. With significant experience in long-term forest management, Plum Creek is equipped and willing to provide meaningful assistance to the committee as you seek to formulate an effective RES. Plum Creek is a member of the National Alliance of Forest owners (NAFO) and also of the Forest Landowners Association (FLA) who have both already submitted comments which we strongly support. In our comments, we would like to highlight two important underlying concepts and two policy considerations as you develop a RES. Two underlying concepts: . New renewable energy markets can enhance the viability of working forests and help ensure that the economic and environmental benefits that forests provide society will continue in the future. In other words, new renewable energy markets are good for forestry and long-term forestland ownership. . Meanwhile, forestry is good for renewable energy. Forests can help provide a diverse, sustainable supply of renewable energy feedstocks, and can help ensure that we meet our renewable energy goals at reasonable cost, therefore imposing no additional cost burdens on the federal government. Two policy considerations: A. RES should contain a broad definition for renewable biomass in order to assure an adequate supply of resources to meet energy objectives. B. A RES should recognize the strong and effective existing regulatory mechanisms already covering forestry activities. two underlying concepts . New renewable energy markets are good for forestry The availability of energy markets for wood fiber provides forest land owners with a new tool to enhance forest health, to reduce forest fire hazard, and to justify investments in forest productivity. New wood fiber markets in renewable energy will promote thinning, forest health treatments and improved forest utilization, which is particularly welcome as traditional markets decline and, in some locations, disappear. The development of fiber markets for energy in this time of rapidly shrinking pulpwood demand will provide an incentive for timberland owners of all kinds to invest in their forests and to keep them in forests rather than converting to other uses. Private forests can increasingly provide for our renewable energy needs as forest productivity increases while providing a valuable service in capturing carbon from our atmosphere as well as the abundant other values that forests provide the nation. . Forestry is good for renewable biomass Our nation is endowed with a range of resources that can be used to achieve renewable energy goals, and the use of woody biomass from forests has some great advantages without which a RES is likely to fall short of its goal. Energy fiber can be produced as a co-product of forest harvests and does not require land use conversion. Biomass generated electricity provides base load power that can be used as a valuable backstop for other kinds of renewable electricity. Forest biomass can be produced on a year-round basis and does not require costly storage. Feedstock collection and transportation infrastructure is largely in place and will not require large scale infrastructure development. Forest biomass is plentiful in regions where other renewable energy resources are lacking. two policy considerations A. A RES should contain a broad definition for renewable biomass A broad definition for renewable biomass that includes whole trees on private forest lands is important primarily for two reasons. The first is that a limited definition can severely constrain the amount of woody biomass that is available for meeting the RES. This limitation is unnecessary and poses the risk of eliminating this option as a viable contributor to the solution. Consider that production tax credits have been available as an incentive for the use of closed loop biomass for over years and has not resulted in the production of a single megawatt hour from a forestry feedstock source since its inception. ``Closed loop'' is a definition that is limited to biomass that is specifically grown as an energy crop. The inclusion of wood that is ``waste'' or ``non- merchantable'' includes some additional material, but this additional material can only be collected after all other commercial opportunities are exhausted. Energy fiber should be allowed to compete in the market place with other uses of wood fiber. Some contend that limiting the definition of renewable biomass is important because of a concern that new energy markets will encourage land owners to harvest all of their forests today rather than growing them for more valuable markets tomorrow. This contention is unwarranted since the value of the fiber markets is the lowest produced from a forest, and energy fiber is the lowest value among fiber markets, and is therefore unlikely to drive the landowner's harvest timing decisions. Secondly, a definition that considers one part of a tree as renewable and another part not to be carries with it unworkable chain- of-custody implications that would be a disincentive to woody biomass producers, especially given that energy material is often removed from the harvest site after being chipped or ground up. B. A RES should recognize the strong and effective existing regulatory mechanism already covering forestry activities Plum Creek is aware that certain interests are concerned that renewable energy incentives for wood fiber will create unintended consequences that need to be addressed and mitigated in the RES. These concerns are unfounded, largely because of the existing regulatory framework that governs forestry practices on forest lands throughout the nation at the state level. This approach has successfully enlisted landowners as partners with states without the force of direct federal regulation. To be effective as an incentive to private landowners' contributions to renewable energy, a RES must avoid new direct federal forest practice regulation. Every state with a forestry resource has a State Forester who is responsible for implementing a framework of practices that address environmental impacts related to forestry. This framework has been in place for decades. The State Foresters work closely with state water quality and wildlife agencies to implement oversight of forest management activities in their respective states. This accountability is supported by state sponsored monitoring which evaluates compliance with state best management practices, forest practice regulations, and accredited certification programs as well as evaluating effectiveness of the practices themselves. Results of this monitoring over years have demonstrated that this is a successful approach and is improving In some places, the increased utilization associated with an available energy market (biomass harvesting) has occurred for over years hand has been incorporated into this monitoring and feedback loop that produces continually improving practices. Additionally, federal involvement in forest practices adds a new cost that is unnecessary and which the federal government can ill afford. conclusion Thank you for considering Plum Creek's comments on this important legislation. We look forward to working productively with a wide group of stakeholders to help achieve America's energy goals. ______ Statement of George Fitch, Mayor, Warrenton, VA Please accept my comments on an important exclusion which needs to be addressed to realize the full potential of renewable energy resources. I would like these comments to be part of the record for the RES hearings: The use of biosolids to produce different forms of renewable energy can make an important contribution to the goals of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the supply of energy from renewable resources. As Congress has promoted the potential of other forms of biomass, and renewable sources, to be used in the production of fuels and energy, Congress should extend the same incentives to the use of biosolids in the production of fuel. All other forms of biomass including agricultural wastes, wood wastes and animal manures are identified as eligible biomass for certain tax incentives and financial assisstance programs. Biosolids is not included. Specifically, section of the IRS Code needs to be amended to extend the % investment tax credit to Combined Heat & Power and other renewble energy facilities that use biosolids to produce a biofuel. Also, Section of the IRS Code needs to include biosolids as an eligible biomass which when used to produce electricity is entitled to the production tax credit. Biosolids is used as a fertilizer in land application which often creates an environmental hazard because it can seep into the watershed and, in the case of Virginia and Maryland, end up in the Chesapeake Bay. (See attachment).* Instead, with the same encouragement extended by legislation to other forms of biomass, biosolids can be used to create renewable energy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Graphic has been retained in committee files. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Gina, as you might recall when I testified back in February , Senator DeMint encouraged me to look at all types of wastes for my waste to energy project to make Warrenton and Fauquier energy independent. Well, here's a waste that has been overlooked in the discussion and legislation on renewable energy) Please let me know if you require any additional information. ______ Statement of the Biomass Thermal Energy Council (BTEC) The Biomass Thermal Energy Council appreciates the opportunity to share our perspective on a proposed national Renewable Electricity Standard (RES). BTEC is an association of biomass fuel producers, appliance manufacturers, supply chain companies and non-profit organizations that view biomass thermal energy as a renewable, responsible, clean and energy-efficient pathway to meeting America's energy needs. BTEC engages in research, education and public advocacy for the fast growing industry of biomass thermal energy. BTEC supports the committee's efforts at finding renewable energy solutions. Our concerns with the current draft RES are grounded in the proposal's narrow focus on electricity generation while overlooking the benefits of thermal energy as part of a broader suite of renewable energy solutions. Energy consumption in America can be divided roughly into thirds: one third electric generation, one third transportation, and one-third heating (thermal) (USDOE EIA). Federal and state energy policy has focused almost entirely on electric generation and transportation. State electric generation renewable portfolio standards (RPS) now exist in states (Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency), providing powerful incentives for investment in and development of solar, wind, hydro, biomass and other electric generation renewable energy technologies. Federal production tax credits exist for biomass, solar, geothermal and wind electric generation. In recent years, federal policy has strongly supported development of renewable transportation fuels such as grain-based and cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel, through strong research and development support, demonstration project funding, and direct production credits and subsidies. Yet virtually no such support exists for thermal renewable energy technologies (except for some limited residential tax credits). The use of biomass to produce thermal energy must compete for finite feedstocks with electric and transportation fuel technologies that are strongly supported through subsidies; an unlevel playing field that places biomass thermal at a competitive disadvantage. For example, in New Hampshire there are seven commercial wood-fired power plants, collectively consuming approximately . million green tons of wood biomass annually to produce about MW of electric output. Operating revenues at these facilities are supplemented by federal production tax credits and sale of renewable energy credits in New England states with RPS programs. Biomass heating must compete for wood resources that are artificially elevated in cost by these subsidies, yet the same public policy goals that provide the rational basis for these subsidies are also met by using biomass to make heat--at much higher energy conversion efficiencies than electric generation. The Biomass Thermal Energy Council supports outcome-based energy policy, rather than technology--based energy policy. We believe that policy should encourage energy technologies that maximize efficiency, minimize carbon emissions, reduce or eliminate demand for imported fossil energy, and reduce harmful air emissions such as particulate matter, and acid rain caused by SO and NO X . Policy should support those technologies that achieve the greatest combination of net benefit in furtherance of these attributes. For example, biomass is converted to electric energy at an efficiency rate of about - %; biomass is converted to a liquid transportation fuel at an efficiency rate of about - %; biomass can be converted to heat energy at an efficiency rate of - %. However, our federal policy promotes and encourages biomass electric and cellulosic ethanol technologies, but provides virtually no support for the much more efficient biomass thermal technologies. As the committee continues to refine the RES proposal, we respectfully request that provisions be added that recognize the considerable benefits of thermal energy. For example, we would support ) adding language that requires biomass electric generation to qualify for renewable energy credits only if it meets a minimum efficiency threshold of percent (with credit for thermal output), effectively requiring cogeneration, ) allowance for renewable energy credits for any thermal output from existing biomass- fueled cogeneration facilities, and ) a commitment by Congress and the administration to fully analyze the mechanisms to extend similar incentives and credits for thermal renewable energy technologies, e.g. biomass, solar thermal, and geothermal. we have specific suggestions for language that we would be pleased to share with the committee. We thank the committee for creating an opportunity to comment on this important issue and look forward to working with you in the coming months to craft a workable and balanced renewable energy policy. ______ Statement of John Droz, Physicist & Environmental Activist, Brantingham Lake, NY Thank you for reaching out for inputs from experts and concerned citizens concerning the possibility of a national Renewable Portfolio Standard. I am a physicist (with electrical energy expertise) with a + year record as an environmental activist. My concern with some of the terms and conditions of the Economic Stimulus package, is that federal and state governments are about to throw a few hundred billion dollars down the drain. We cannot afford that! What's worse is that their likely plan will essentially assure (if Dr. Hansen, Al Gore, etc. are right) that we will have an environmental calamity of historic proportions. This is all coming about for one very simple reason: solutions to our very real energy problems are being driven by lobbyists, not the science. For instance, the carte blanche support of essentially all renewables--as if they are all roughly equivalent sources of electrical power--is inaccurate, and is not scientifically supportable. We should indeed be seriously considering alternative sources of electrical power, but the criteria should be that they would only receive government support (e.g. via RPS, PTC, etc.) if they are are least equal to existing sources of electrical power. ``Equal'' would be such well-defined grid considerations as reliability, predictability, dispatchability, cost, etc. Determining whether or not alternatives meet this critical criteria is a straightforward matter: subject each candidate to scientific methodology. So far, this has NOT HAPPENED with heavily promoted renewables like wind power and solar power. The good news on all this is that I have a guaranteed solution--and one that will cost us nothing! [See attached article about EEA.] Let me make an analogy here. Let's say I came to you  years ago and asked that the applicable senate committee do a well-researched series on subprime lending, and its offspring (e.g. derivatives). PBS had a recent special about how (with all the financial geniuses we have in the US) that we've gotten ourselves into such a financial mess. Interestingly the experts interviewed identified the exact same reasons that exist today regarding electrical energy: ) we were too trusting, ) the plans were built on faulty premises, ) no thinking outside the box was listened to, etc. If an objective, comprehensive analysis had been done then, consider the extraordinarily enormous positive ramifications that would have had on hundreds of millions of Americans--indeed on billions of people world wide. Without exaggeration, this situation is of equal magnitude to the subprime fiasco. Indeed there are many that believe that the fate of the planet is at stake based on what we do right now. Please read the attached ``RPS--An Illusion of a Solution'' (PDF) for a different perspective on this matter. In short, the implications of the energy policies we are adopting (e.g. RPS's, blind support for all things renewable, not genuinely supporting nuclear power, etc.) all will have EXTRAORDINARILY NEGATIVE ECONOMIC & ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES for our country. The solution is to carefully assess our options, and choose only those that have been independently and objectively proven to make scientific, economic and environmental sense. ______ Statement of Laurence D. Wiseman, American Forest Foundation The American Forest Foundation, a nonprofit conservation organization that focuses on ensuring the continued viability of America's family-owned forests, believes that family forests offer tremendous potential as a source of clean, renewable energy to fuel both our nation's electricity and fuel needs. If Congress is to pass a renewable electricity mandate, such as that included in the draft legislation being considered by this Committee, it must allow for electricity generation from sustainable biomass from family forests. Currently, biomass supplies roughly three percent of our total energy consumption in the U.S. Most of this is consumed through industrial heat and steam production at pulp and paper and other wood manufacturing facilities. If you consider current forest inventories, family forests can sustainably supply a significant portion of additional biomass, which can be used to heat and power millions of homes or fuel millions of vehicles. While providing the nation with renewable energy, biomass harvesting from family forests can also increase the economic and environmental viability of these forests, helping landowners practice conservation and stay on the land. Because of the benefits for family forest owners and the environment, the American Forest Foundation supports increased opportunities for the production of renewable energy from sustainably managed family forests. To increase opportunities for renewable energy production from sustainable family forests biomass, Congress should enact renewable energy policies that: Allow all sustainably harvested forest biomass: renewable energy policies, whether incentives or mandates, should encourage the use of all forest biomass that is harvested sustainably, including with verification through appropriate mechanisms. Encourage family forest owner participation in markets: renewable energy policies should ensure that small family forest owners can participate in market opportunities and avoid overly burdensome requirements that would prevent landowners from participating. Ensure long-term viability of the industry: renewable energy policies should encourage a long-term, sustainable, renewable energy industry that supports strong rural economies and healthy forest landscapes. Help Supplement forest products markets: Renewable energy policies should supplement, not replace, existing forest products markets. Consider Impacts on Forest Resources: Policies that encourage energy production from forest biomass must consider both the short and long-term impacts of renewable energy markets on forest resources and avoid incentives that lead to unsustainable forest management practices. Unfortunately, a previous market setting standard, the Renewable Fuels Standard, includes a very narrow definition of the forest biomass that is considered renewable under the standard. This definition restricts the use of biomass harvested from naturally regenerated forests, new plantation forests, and other ill-defined forest categories. We urge the Committee to avoid this prescriptive approach and instead encourage inclusion of all biomass that is harvested sustainably. It will be very difficult to meet a renewable electricity mandate, particularly in the southern part of the U.S., unless sustainable forest biomass is considered renewable and can be used to meet the standard. It is critical however, that we utilize this tremendous resource in a sustainable way--ensuring that family forests can continue to be a renewing, clean resource that the nation can depend on. Each year, the American Forest Foundation trains , educators and helps over , family landowners manage forests for wildlife, habitat, recreation and sustainable products. Through our programs such as the American Tree Farm System, and our conservation work on the ground, the Foundation strives to create new opportunities to help family forest owners stay on the land and manage it sustainably. Members of the Tree Farm system and participants in our other forest programs are committed to conservation and sustainable management, helping to ensure Americans have clean water and air, recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat, beautiful scenery, and products, including renewable energy. The American Tree Farm System is an internationally recognized and credible forest certification system, recently recognized by the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Systems (PEFC). Family landowners certified in this system agree to comply with standards of sustainability, have a management plan that guides their forest management activities over the long-term, comply with all federal, state, and local laws, and agree to periodic auditing and verification of their forest management. Across the country there are over million family forest owners who own nearly two-thirds of the private forestland in the U.S. These lands are critical national infrastructure, especially as climate change calls for additional carbon storage to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and demands increase for renewable energy to reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources. Producing renewable energy from sustainable family forests, gives family owners additional markets and revenue streams for their products. As traditional wood products markets, like those for paper or furniture products, continue to decline, family forest owners are left looking for other sources of revenue to help them stay on the land and keep their investment in their forest viable. AFF strongly believes that any renewable energy incentives should help supplement, not replace existing forest products markets. We believe both market opportunities have value and we can accommodate both on the landscape. While the markets for real-estate are low in many areas, family forest owners, particularly in rapidly growing areas, still feel the pressure to sell their land when developers come knocking. National averages point to a loss of roughly , acres a day of forests, as they are converted to parking lots, strip malls, and condominiums, never to be recovered. Annually, this amounts to about million acres, an area roughly the size of the state of Delaware. In addition to forest loss, forested tracts are being broken up into smaller tracts at alarming rates, as more people move into forested areas. The US Forest Service predicts that by the year , roughly . million acres of forests will see substantial increases in housing density. As you can see, the pressures are mounting, as family forest owners strive to stay on the land and keep their land as forests. Yet communities across America need privately owned forests to ensure clean water, wildlife habitat, recreation, and the many public benefits forests provide. Good forest management practices can also help reduce flooding, decrease the risk of large and uncontrolled fires, and reduce carbon from our atmosphere. Each year, our nation's forests capture and store ten percent of our total U.S. carbon emissions. Harvesting renewable energy from family forests in a sustainable manner will provide an important tool to help family forest owners stay on the land and maintain healthy, working forests in communities across America. Most renewable energy markets will rely on small diameter trees, tops, limbs and residues, and trees removed to allow room for healthier trees to grow. Removing these materials can increase the health of forests, making the forest more resilient when impacted with insects, diseases, or wildfires. Often, removing these materials improves wildlife habitat and forage areas for key species. Many existing forest management tools, such as forest certification systems, management planning, professional forester involvement, and the implementation of best management practices, are in place to help family forest owners to manage their lands sustainably. We urge the Committee to utilize these existing tools to the greatest extent, and avoid new stipulations that would reduce the viability of the biomass market for small forest owners. The American Forest Foundation looks forward to working with you to craft legislation that addresses the above issues and gain support for these concepts. ______ Statement of the National Association of State Foresters The National Association of State Foresters (NASF) greatly appreciates the opportunity to provide a written statement to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources (Committee) majority staff regarding a proposed federal renewable electricity standard (RES). NASF is a non-profit organization comprised of the directors of all state and territorial forest management agencies in our country. Our members have a public trust responsibility for managing and protecting two- thirds of the nations' forestland, which is held in private or state ownership. NASF views forests as a strategic national resource and offers the following recommendations as the Committee and Congress work toward a solution addressing climate change and the nation's economic and energy security needs. I. NASF Supports an RES that Takes Advantage of Forests' Energy and Climate Benefits NASF promotes the development of policies and programs related to harvesting forest biomass for energy that ensure the sustainability of forest resources. State Foresters approach issues related to wood-based bioenergy and renewable fuels from the following perspective: NASF views forests as a strategic national resource and supports diverse and robust markets for the full spectrum of woody materials to allow landowners and forest managers to practice sustainable forestry. Emerging and existing markets for wood-based bioenergy and renewable fuels offer new opportunities to utilize previously unused, unmerchantable material. Intensive forest management can improve growth rates and productivity of forest stands resulting in increases in woody biomass (and other forest products) and greater ability of forests to sequester carbon. Woody-biomass is a secure, cost-effective source of renewable energy, which--in many cases--is produced locally and can generate revenue for urban and other forest-based communities. Biomass electric facilities can create between . and . direct jobs for each MWH of installed capacity.* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Innovative Natural Resources Solutions. . A Strategy for Increasing the Use of Woody Biomass for Energy. Prepared for the National Association of State Foresters Forest Markets Committee. Last accessed online at: http://www.stateforesters.org/ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Forest residues in the United States can generate enough electricity ( million MWH) to power all of Wyoming, Montana, Delaware, DC and Vermont annually. These same million green tons of residue could alternatively produce four billion gallons of ethanol to displace the gasoline used each year in Washington, D.C., Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.* ii. federal policy should not interfere with the ability of the nation's forests to sustainably contribute to renewable energy Forestlands in the U.S. can produce million dry tons of biomass feedstock annually, yet the country currently derives only three percent of its energy from wood. Woody biomass as a fuel source has the potential to create thousands of new jobs and substantially increase the percentage of renewable sources needed to meet the nation's energy demands. Sustainably managed trees and forests can mitigate and adapt to climate change while providing other societal benefits such as clean air and water, wildlife habitat, recreation and thousands of forest products. Trees in urban areas provide enormous savings in commercial and residential energy costs and provide environmental air and water benefits beyond any other form of engineering. Wood-based bioenergy initiatives are also providing new markets that give landowners more options to retain and manage their forests while generating income and promoting economic development in forest-based communities. Realizing these benefits, however, will hinge on Congress' ability to craft federal policy that does not interfere with the ability of all the nation's forests to potentially contribute to renewable energy. NASF has particular concerns with the current definition of eligible biomass found in the Energy Independence and Security Act of (EISA). As it stands, the definition severely constrains the ability of non-federal forest lands to supply feedstock to our nation's renewable fuels goals. Mandating that the over two-thirds of our nation's forests that fall outside of federal ownership can only supply feedstock as a byproduct of other production ignores the fact that our state and private forests can supply biomass effectively and in an environmentally sustainable manner. Limiting the ability of forest landowners to profit from their forests increases the likelihood that the forest will subsequently be converted to some form of non-forested development. New plantations either established on bare land or converted from other vegetative cover after the date of enactment do not qualify as source material. The current definition also effectively and practically eliminates the ability of our public forest lands to supply feedstock for renewable fuels. Permitting public forest lands to supply feedstock would provide a multitude of benefits, including improved overall forest health and the reduction of the hazardous fuels that serve as the lynchpin for catastrophic wildfire. The exclusion is overly restrictive--particularly in light of the extensive network of federal environmental laws (e.g., NEPA, NFMA) which guarantee sustainability-- and essentially eliminates market forces from helping cover the rising costs of forest health and fuel reduction treatments at a time when warming climates and limited budgets suggest it is needed most. iii. federal policy should provide states flexibility to help accomplish renewable energy goals State Foresters have statutory authority to ensure the sustainability of the nation's nearly million acres of state and private forests. The forest types in each state are as diverse as the people and the economies in which they are situated. As a result, a national, one-size-fit all approach to defining forest management and land use policy in an RES will be problematic as it does not reflect the diverse and unique context for each and every forest and the laws of each state. NASF supports shifting focus of criteria away from federal definitions and towards addressing sustainability through existing tools, common forestry practices and other well established procedures. State Foresters are best-positioned to make decisions regarding sustainable forest biomass utilization that do not adversely impact local forest conditions. NASF supports an approach that takes advantage of the strong environmental record provided by the vigorous network of federal and state laws and regulations alongside other voluntary programs that provide the necessary safeguards for woody-biomass removals. Accomplishing renewable energy goals should rely on the ongoing work of federal natural resource agencies, state forestry agencies and state forest management Best Management Practice (BMP) bodies, and nongovernmental natural resource professionals. State Foresters want to ensure sustainability in an RES, while avoiding impractical prescriptions and pricing biomass utilization systems out of the range of feasibility. Sustainability requirements should be defined by the state, be feasible in implementation and enforcement, and should limit administrative, ``transaction'' and operational costs to allow all forest landowners to participate. Without these elements, forests--particularly from the million small, non-industrial ownerships--will play a limited role in meeting the RES. iv. broad definition of forest biomass should be included in a federal renewable electricity standard NASF urges a broad definition of renewable biomass that fully recognizes that all of our nation's forests are a renewable resource and ready source of biomass feedstock regardless of the political boundaries that surround them. Restricting wood from private lands and prohibiting the use of wood from federal lands are unnecessary constraints that leave out completely sustainable and readily available sources of green energy. This will needlessly hamper our nation's efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions and national security concerns related to reliance on foreign fossil fuel sources. A broad definition in the RES can help address many of the barriers which stand in the way of meeting management objectives on all of the nation's forests. First, it can help generate critical markets for woody biomass which provide new income sources for families and individuals helping them cover their costs to own and maintain their forests. Keeping forestlands working and sustainable is a primary driver for our policy positions. Second, new markets are accompanied by new industry and an opportunity for communities to create and maintain family-wage jobs and diversity their economies. Third, local biomass markets provide new opportunities for public land managers to treat more ``at-risk'' acres, dispose of slash in way that is timely, and reduce emissions released by wildfires. v. nasf is ready to help craft responsible renewable energy legislation that benefits the nation's forests NASF commends the Committee and Congress on addressing the immense challenge of reducing the nation's dependence on fossil fuels. All renewable resources will be needed to meet the country's energy needs. Forests have a key advantage given their ability to produce energy independent of atmospheric conditions that other renewable sources are subject to. NASF believes there are constructive and practical options to consider as we work to ensure the sustainability of our nation's forest resource. We stand ready to help craft a RES that addresses sustainability concerns related to forests in a way that draws upon the strength of existing--and adapting where necessary--forest practices to meet local forest conditions. ______ Statement of the Society of American Foresters On behalf of the Society of American Foresters (SAF), which represents every segment of forestry in the United States with more than , members, please accept the following testimony for the Hearing Record on the Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) held February , . As an organization chartered to advance the science, education, technology, and practice of forestry for the benefit of society, the SAF believes that woody biomass energy from our nation's forests is part of the solution to supplying America with reliable renewable energy. As the Senate is aware, it is distressing that at a time when considerable efforts are being made to address global climate change-- by preventing the conversion of forests to competing uses and by mitigating the likelihood of increasingly devastating wildfires--the definition of ``biomass'' in a federal RES could needlessly limit the management options available to federal land managers, and diminish the market incentives available to private forest landowners that allow them to resist development pressures and maintain their land as forest. We commend the Senate's efforts to craft a more scientifically, socially, and ecologically appropriate definition, which can help balance the nation's most pressing forest management needs and safeguard the important environmental and societal values our forestlands provide. SAF supports strategies and policies that promote the development of economically and environmentally viable forest biomass energy production together with those that assist communities, forest owners, public forest managers, and local entrepreneurs in accomplishing urgent wildfire prevention and forest health improvement projects. This includes appropriately defining ``woody biomass'' in any federal legislation. Increased utilization of forest biomass will also help combat global climate change and improve the nation's energy security by providing an abundant, renewable fuel resource as a substitute for imported fossil fuels in both public utility and industrial power generation facilities. On public lands in the West, many of the silvicultural treatments prescribed to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire and improve forest health will generate large volumes of forest biomass. Increased utilization of forest biomass can improve forest conditions in the eastern and southern states as well, where additional markets for low-quality and small-diameter trees also will enable forest managers to improve forest health. On other forests, both public and private across the country, forest health and restoration treatments are needed to control insects and disease and to improve wildlife habitat and watersheds. This type of management can be costly, as much of the biomass removed currently has little to no value. An RES, structured appropriately, would help to create a market for woody biomass. This, in turn, could encourage much-needed forest health or fuels reduction projects by offsetting some of the cost of biomass removal. An RES with a restrictive, one-size-fits-all definition would encourage the opposite. Lately, there has been much discussion of the sustainability of biomass power generation under a federal RES. There are two potential approaches to addressing sustainability. An outcome based approach would allow a broad definition and the flexibility to manage forestland sustainably. Ideally, on private land, this would be done with the assistance of a professional forester who writes a management plan that addresses soil conservation, water quality, wildlife habitat, and biodiversity. This approach would allow management decisions to be site specific and unique to the forest stand being managed. It also would serve as a powerful incentive for landowners to consult with professional foresters to promote best management principles, and to allow management efforts to adapt to changes in the landscape or as new science and management techniques become available (i.e., adapting climate change or other disturbances). The second approach is prescriptive and process-based, and would include a one-size-fits-all definition that precludes certain biomass through diameter limits or other prescriptive requirements. Although this method may give some interested parties a level of comfort, it is a disservice to our nation's forests and has no basis in science. Forests are complex, diverse, and in constant flux as a result of natural and man-made disturbances. No two acres are alike and, as such, no two acres should be treated alike. Thus, a prescriptive definition could serve as a disincentive to restore forest health in many areas, because federal requirements would be too onerous and may even contradict necessary silvicultural treatments. The Energy Bill's Renewable Fuels Definition of ``renewable biomass'' is a good example of this problem. In regard to public lands, the SAF believes current laws and regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), National Forest Management Act (NFMA), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), provide more than adequate requirements for the sustainability of biomass removal. Past biomass definitions have excluded areas such as Wilderness, Wilderness Study Areas, and inventoried Roadless areas. Although this is politically understandable, from a forestry perspective it makes little sense. Some of these areas are in need of habitat restoration, insects and disease containment, or fuels reduction projects, which could maintain the character of these special designations while simultaneously improving forest health. Land managers in the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management should decide what projects are needed and where. The biomass from these projects should count toward an RES that helps offset the cost of removal and stretch appropriated dollars toward the further improvement of public lands. Finally, it's important to remember that forest resources are renewable. Although some biomass may be removed from public or private land, it will inevitably grow back and likely need to be removed again. There are roughly billion board feet of new growth and billion board feet of mortality on our national forests every year. In contrast, there are (on average) two billion board feet of removals. As we discuss the sustainability of biomass, which is imperative, we cannot forget that we are losing ground in our efforts to restore public forests. We also must remember that creating a viable biomass market through an RES will help protect private forestlands from development and safeguard the environmental and economic benefits on which we all depend. ______ Statement of the National Alliance of Forest Owners introduction The National Alliance of Forest Owners (NAFO) is pleased to submit comments to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (Committee) majority staff draft for a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) proposal. NAFO is an organization of private forest owners committed to promoting Federal policies that protect the economic and environmental values of privately-owned forests at the national level. NAFO membership encompasses more than million acres of private forestland in states. NAFO members are well positioned to help our nation meet its renewable energy objectives, and NAFO is prepared to work with the Committee and Congress toward that end. Private working forests are a fundamental part of the strategic natural resources infrastructure of our nation, producing renewable, recyclable and reusable wood and paper products, sustaining plants and wildlife, producing clean water and air, and providing recreation experiences. Working forests also play a substantial role in helping this country achieve energy independence while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Forest biomass is a renewable energy feedstock that can help meet our national renewable energy goals in all regions of the country, if placed on a level playing field with other renewable energy sources. NAFO asks this Committee to recognize biomass from private working forests as an eligible feedstock on an even playing field with other renewable energy sources as it develops a federal renewable electricity standard. The RES should recognize that forest owners already work within a well established framework of laws, regulations and non-regulatory programs and actions that promote and maintain responsible forest management, and will continue to do so as they help our nation meet its renewable electricity objectives. ii. our nation will not meet its objectives to increase our reliance on secure, domestic sources of renewable energy without the contributions of working forests Wood is a dependable, domestic renewable energy resource that can be utilized for energy production through a variety of processes like biomass generation, wood gasification, and conversion to cellulosic biofuels. Wood, wood residuals and other plant material can be utilized to produce steam and heat hot water boilers. Steam can be converted to electrical power by turbines or used to heat to buildings through piping distribution networks. Newer ``wood gasification'' technologies heat wood in an oxygen-starved environment, collect gases from the wood, and later mix the gases with air or pure oxygen for combustion. Wood gases can be cooled, filtered, and purified to remove pollutants and used as fuel for internal combustion engines, micro-turbines, and gas turbines. As members of the Committee have discussed in the past, a federal RES that does not appropriately include all forms of forest biomass poses challenges to regions of the country where forest biomass is the prevailing renewable energy source and where wind, geothermal, solar or hydroelectric power are not expected to make a significant contribution. Biomass, for example, already produces roughly percent of the nation's non-hydro renewable electricity.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ U.S. EIA at www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/alternate/page/ renew_energy_consump/table _html--Biomass is the primary energy source for . billion kilowatt hours of the billion kilowatt hours of non-hydro renewable energy produced in (preliminary figures, subject to revision). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Existing state RES policies reflect the importance of utilizing biomass to successfully lower demand for traditional fossil fuels. To help meet renewable energy goals, at least states and the District of Columbia have all included biomass as a renewable generation source. A federal standard that does not acknowledge or encourage the full use of forest biomass could jeopardize the nation's ability to meet its overall renewable energy objective. iii. definitions of eligible biomass feedstock should put working forests on an even playing field with other renewable energy sources Definitions of qualifying renewable energy feedstocks should provide a level playing field for market access across all feedstock sources and encompass the full range of forest biomass, including trees and other plants, forest residuals (e.g., tops, branches, bark, etc), and byproducts of manufacturing (e.g., sawdust, bark, chips, dissolved wood retrieved from the paper-making process, etc). Presently there are at least four different definitions of qualifying forest biomass in federal statute\ \. This adds complexity and confusion to project developers, biomass producers and federal program administrators who are required to determine how the various, and at times conflicting, definitions interact with one another. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Separate definitions of eligible forest biomass can be found in Section (c)( ) of the Internal Revenue Code ( U.S.C. (c)( )); Section (b)( ) of the Energy Policy Act of ( U.S.C. (b)); Section ( )(I) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of ( U.S.C. (o)( )(I)); and Section ( ) of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of ( U.S.C. ( )). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NAFO has particular concern about the definition of eligible forest biomass found in the Energy Independence and Security Act of (EISA). As currently written, this definition places confusing parameters on significant acreages of private forestlands in the form of land use restrictions. These restrictions limit the ability of forest biomass to contribute to meeting the ambitious mandate to produce billion gallons of renewable fuels annually by . The EISA definition significantly restricts the use of forest biomass from naturally growing and regenerating forests, which make up more than percent of our nation's non-federal forests. By doing so, it removes potential markets and viable economic options needed by private forest owners to support thinning for a variety of sustainable forest management practices, and who are already experiencing economic pressures from the steep declines in traditional markets such as solid wood and pulp and paper manufacturing. It also places forest biomass at a significant disadvantage to other biomass feedstocks, such as short rotation agricultural crops that require more energy, nutrients and water to grow, as well as other renewable energy sources. If applied to a federal renewable electricity standard, the definition of qualifying forest biomass in the EISA could discourage necessary and appropriate forest management activities that promote forest health and sustainability. It also creates complex chain-of- custody requirements that could cause electricity producers to exclude large portions of potential feedstock supply in order to meet compliance requirements. If identifying qualifying feedstock becomes too complex or costly, project developers may forego the development of facilities that use forest biomass altogether, thereby placing the overall RES in jeopardy. iv. utilizing working forests will both meet our nation's energy needs and help reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas (ghg) concentrations Experts have long recognized working forests as a source of real and verifiable reductions in greenhouse gases and a cost-effective source of industrial GHG offsets. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights forest management as a primary tool to reduce GHG emissions. The IPCC states that, ``In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fiber or energy from the forest, will generate the greatest mitigation benefit''.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Climate Change : Mitigation. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [B. Metz, O.R. Davidson, P.R. Bosch, R. Dave, L.A. Meyer (eds)], Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Similarly, the EPA has concluded that there is ``scientific consensus' that the carbon dioxide emitted from burning biomass will not increase CO in the air if it is done on a sustainable basis.''\ \ This position is supported not only by the IPCC, but also by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the World Resources Institute (WRI) and other credible scientific bodies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Combined Heat and Power Partnership, Biomass Combined Heat and Power Catalog of Technologies, (Sept. ) available at www.epa.gov/chp/documents/ biomass_chp_catalog.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appropriately including forest biomass in an RES standard would take full advantage of these carbon mitigation benefits in the energy context. Likewise, a policy that discourages forest biomass utilization will forfeit these benefits, particularly in areas where fossil fuels are the predominant source of energy production and where alternative forms of renewable energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal, are not viable options. v. forest owners work within a well-established framework of laws, regulations and non-regulatory programs and actions that maintain responsible forest management Private forestry operations are regulated by a fairly complex set of laws, regulations, and non-regulatory policies at the federal, state and local level. While the resulting framework is fairly complicated and can vary widely between jurisdictions, overall it has been very effective in improving the environmental performance of forestry operations, and can be expected to do so in the future. Under this framework, working forests provide significant environmental benefits while providing important economic benefits like renewable energy. Watershed protection, wildlife habitat, carbon dioxide absorption, and other ``environmental services'' are currently provided by private landowners at little or no cost to society. Whenever policymakers consider new environmental requirements on private forestry, such as eligibility requirements for forest biomass intended for energy use, the implications for the economic viability of working forests should be considered. If new regulatory requirements reduce the private forest owner's ability to realize value from a working forest; or if new market limitations constrain market opportunities for working forests, private forest owners might be compelled to consider other uses for their forests, which could result in the reduction of many of the broader environmental benefits they provide. Attached is a white paper describing the various federal, state and local laws, regulations and non-regulatory programs and activities influencing private forest management. We anticipate that this summary will be helpful to the Committee in comparing the environmental performance of private forests to other biomass feedstock sources and ensuring that new policies do not duplicate, complicate or jeopardize the already successful delivery of environmental benefits provided by current forest practices. vi. nafo is prepared to work with congress and other stakeholders to realize the contributions of working forests in energy policy in an environmentally responsible way NAFO is prepared to help develop a constructive approach to using forest biomass to help meet our nation's energy needs. Notwithstanding the strong record of environmental benefits private forests provide,NAFO is prepared to work with policy makers and other stakeholders to ensure that forest biomass, and all other sources of renewable energy, help meet our renewable energy objectives in an environmentally responsible way. NAFO suggests the Committee apply the following principles when crafting legislation addressing the eligibility of forest biomass as a renewable energy source . Federal renewable energy policy should promote rather than discourage the use of forest biomass for renewable energy.-- Federal policy, and definitions of qualifying forest biomass in particular, should be broad and inclusive so as to encourage forest biomass utilization and foster cost-effective compliance. If definitions and compliance requirements become too complex (e.g. the RFS definition), they will place forest biomass at a disadvantage with respect to other feedstocks or renewable energy sources and ultimately discourage its use. This, in turn, would jeopardize the overall goal of the RES and potentially reduce the carbon mitigation and other environmental services private working forests provide. . Federal policy should acknowledge and support existing federal, state, local, and nongovernmental forestry practices and capabilities.--Federal policy should acknowledge and support the existing framework of federal, state and local laws, practices and capabilities that influence current forest practices, including the ongoing work of federal natural resource agencies, state forestry agencies, bodies that administer state water quality BMPs, and nongovernmental natural resource professionals. This existing framework is well suited to address local conditions and needs. Federal policies should also assume that this framework will continue in the long-term and be applied to all forestry practices, whether associated with traditional or emerging markets. . Federal policy should recognize that state and local resource professionals are best positioned to identify and address changing resource conditions and emerging needs.--Given the uniqueness and diversity of forest ecosystems across the nation, it is extremely problematic to set forest management or land use standards in a federal policy. Potentially changing resource conditions and needs are best addressed with a more tailored approach at the local level by state and local authorities using existing tools, common forestry practices, and well-established procedures. State and local authorities should continue to fulfill their responsibilities to assess any changing resource conditions associated with existing or future forest practices, including the use of biomass to meet federal energy standards, and make a determination as to whether additional measures are needed to address emerging needs. If state or local authorities determine that additional measures are necessary, they should be allowed to continue the current practice of identifying and taking necessary corrective measures, following the BMP model that has proven highly successful across the country in protecting water quality. vii. conclusion NAFO strongly supports our nation's efforts to establish new sources of renewable energy, and thereby reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and imported energy. America's working forests can play a fundamental role in meeting these new and growing energy needs. U.S. policies should encourage investment in forests as a source of renewable energy, by establishing non-restrictive definitions of forest biomass eligible for use in renewable energy programs. A Federal RES, if adopted, should fully include forest biomass as a renewable energy source, and ensure that the definition of biomass encompasses the full range of forest biomass, including trees and other plants; forest residuals; and wood byproducts including sawdust, bark, wood chips, and dissolved wood. In addition, Federal policy should allow state and local authorities to continue their current role in assessing resource conditions associated with forest management establishing, where needed, any additional measures that may be needed to address emerging resource needs associated with the use of forest biomass for renewable energy production. Such an approach will enable our country to meet is renewable energy objectives and allow working forests to make their full contribution to our nation's renewable energy portfolio while providing important additional environmental benefits, such as reduced GHG emissions, clean water, wildlife habitat quality recreation and other environmental benefits Americans need and enjoy. Attachment.--White paper the environmental regulation of private forests in the united states Private forestry operations are regulated by a fairly complex set of laws, regulations, and non-regulatory policies at the federal, state and local level. While the resulting framework is fairly complicated and can vary widely between jurisdictions, it has been effective in improving the environmental performance of forestry operations, and can be expected to do so in the future. In addition to useful forest products, jobs and economic activity, working forests provide significant environmental benefits. Watershed protection, wildlife habitat, carbon dioxide absorption, and other ``environmental services'' are currently provided by private landowners at little or no cost to society. Whenever policymakers consider new environmental requirements on private forestry, such as eligibility requirements for biomass feedstocks intended for energy use, the implications for the economic viability of working forests should be considered. If new regulatory requirements reduce the private forest owner's ability to realize value from a working forest; or if new market limitations constrain market opportunities for working forests, private forest owners might be compelled to consider other uses for their forests, which could result in the reduction of many of the broader environmental benefits they provide. background Private forests are currently regulated at the federal, state, and local level. The Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act each apply to private forest operations. These laws have been implemented through a variety of state programs, regulations, court decisions, agency precedents and policies. More narrowly focused State forest management regimes, local land use requirements, zoning and other stipulations have also been used to regulate or manage forestry operations. Additionally, third party sustainable forestry programs and a variety of voluntary agreements have also been used to achieve desired environmental goals. There is considerable evidence that this complex framework of regulatory and non-regulatory activities has substantially reduced adverse environmental impacts from forestry, and will continue to do so in the future. While this paper will not exhaustively chronicle the scope of methods available to government at every level to regulate, manage, encourage or influence activities on private forests, many of the primary methods are listed here. the clean water act The Clean Water Act\ \ is arguably the federal law of predominant relevance and application. Since forestry operations generally involve the construction of access roads and water crossings, as well as the disturbance or removal of trees and plants that would otherwise tend to control erosion, most of the environmental concerns related to forestry operations involve the protection of water quality and aquatic habitat. Forestry operations can also involve the disturbance of plant litter and soil, the application of herbicides and fertilizers, equipment lubrication and refueling. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of (Public Law - ), as amended. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the Clean Water Act, ``point sources'' such as industrial facilities and wastewater treatment plants with effluents that can be directly monitored at known outfalls are regulated with a permit system based on technology-based effluent limitations. Conversely, ``non point sources'' such as runoff from forests and farms cannot be so easily monitored, measured or regulated. This is particularly true with forestry, since forestry activities generally involve numerous relatively small operations occurring sporadically over large amounts of space and long periods of time, often by different landowners operating independently of one another. Complicating the situation is the fact that different forests, even those in close proximity with one another, may have vastly different characteristics in terms of topography, tree species, soil types, wildlife habitat, geology and hydrology. Consequently, the approach to protecting the environment from forestry activities must be adapted to local conditions and circumstances. Efforts to control non point source pollution from forest operations have been fairly successful. National Water Quality Inventories conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency now contend that ``the most significant source of water quality impairment to rivers and streams and lakes, ponds, and reservoirs is agriculture, and the most significant source of impairment to estuaries is municipal point sources of pollution.''\ \ Other significant sources include urban runoff, storm sewer discharges, and pollutants deposited from the atmosphere.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Forestry. - . EPA- -B- - , United States Environmental Protection Agency, April . (Emphasis added.) \ \ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although forestry operations create fewer water quality impacts than agricultural operations, urban runoff and storm water, sewage plants and natural sources,\ \ major hydrologic events such as year storms can nevertheless result in significant releases of sediments\ \ when sound forest management practices have not been employed. Although forest watershed protection efforts began on an ad hoc basis in the early half of the th Century, Section of the Clean Water Act, adopted in , directed states to develop watershed or regional water quality management plans to identify significant non point sources and assess their cumulative effects, and to ``set forth procedures and methods (including land use requirements) to control to the extent feasible such sources.''\ \ In , the Clean Water Act was amended to include, among other provisions, Section , requiring states to develop control plans for any non point source activities that were causing state waters to fall short of water quality goals. Taken together, sections and comprise the authority for States to control non point source pollution, with oversight by EPA. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ National Water Quality Inventory: Report to Congress.

EPA- -B- - , United States Environmental Protection Agency, April . \ \ Section ( )(F)(ii) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of . --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To control non point source pollution from forestry operations, most states have adopted Best Management Practices (BMPs) designed to take regional climate, soils, topography, biota, legal, technical and socioeconomic factors into account. BMPs vary widely among jurisdictions, which is understandable since a BMP that is appropriate for a coastal plain pine forest in Georgia may be wholly inadequate for a mountainous temperate rainforest in Oregon. In spite of their variations, there are aspects common to most BMPs across jurisdictions. The general philosophy of BMPs is to ``avoid, minimize, and mitigate.'' More specifically, BMPs will generally strive to ) minimize soil compaction and the extent of bare soils; ) separate exposed soils from surface waters; ) separate fertilizer and herbicide applications from surface waters; ) inhibit hydraulic connections between bare ground and surface waters; ) provide forested buffers around watercourses; and ) promote stable roads and watercourse crossings.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Olszewski, R. and C.R. Jackson. . Best management practices and water quality. In A primer on the top ten forest environmental and sustainability issues in the southern United States. NCASI Special Report No. - . Research Triangle Park, NC: National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Different states manage BMPs in different ways. Some states employ mandatory BMPs administered by State Foresters under a focused state forest practices act. Other states employ non-regulatory BMPs developed or approved by state agencies, with landowner education to encourage compliance, and authority for agencies to take action against landowners who do not comply. Regardless of the approach, BMPs and the broader non point source pollution prevention programs implemented by the states are subject to EPA oversight and approval. States whose water quality inventories fail to show continued improvement invite closer scrutiny and review by the EPA, and poor performance can result in grant funding reductions or a federal takeover of the state program. Over time, BMPs have become an accepted, well understood, widely adopted method of protecting water quality in the waters of the United States. Although it is beyond dispute that BMPs are widely stipulated, it is appropriate to consider ) how effective they are in protecting water resources and other environmental values, ) what the compliance rates are for BMP implementation, and ) the factors associated with high rates of implementation and compliance. There is a high correlation between high water quality and forested areas. Most of the waters failing to meet EPA-approved water quality standards and requiring the establishment of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) specifications are in urban or industrial areas. But this correlation alone does not prove the effectiveness of BMPs. Fortunately, a variety of watershed scale research projects in the published literature have evaluated the effectiveness of BMPs in the United States. These studies, some of which are summarized by Stednick and Ice,\ \ have found BMPs to be highly effective when they are used. Other studies point out that the major impediment to the protecting water quality is the lack of compliance with BMPs.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Ice, G.G.; Stednick, J.D.

Research Triangle Park, N.C.: National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc. Forestry BMP prescriptions vary among jurisdictions due to a multitude of factors, but properly implemented BMPs are effective regardless of jurisdictional requirements; While monitoring programs and protocols vary among jurisdictions, rates of BMP implementation are generally very high. Jurisdictions having long-term monitoring programs in place have shown steady improvement in compliance rates over time. Forest certification programs, along with education and outreach programs, have had a positive and significant role in increasing BMP compliance with the various jurisdictional recommendations and/or recommendations. This last point is particularly important. According to NCASI, the high rates of BMP compliance reported for industrially managed forestlands ``are primarily attributable to sustainable forestry programs'' such as the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC), and the American Tree Farm program. NCASI contends that these third party verification programs have been documented to result in higher compliance rates with BMPs. BMPs have become, therefore, effective tools to advance the goals of the Federal Clean Water Act. As a consequence of this success, BMPs are increasingly being used to address ancillary issues such as wildlife habitat and other issues, some of which fall under the cognizance of other federal laws. the endangered species act The Endangered Species Act\ \ (ESA) applies to private forestry operations as a direct federal regulatory program which relies mainly on prohibitions against the ``taking'' of listed threatened or endangered plant and animal species. About , species in the United States and U.S. waters have been listed as threatened or endangered,\ \ many of which spend at least part of their life cycle in forests or waters affected by forestry activities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ U.S.C. ; U.S.C. et seq. \ \ See http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/esa/ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although the ESA does not enlist the support of States or state programs in ways comparable to other federal environmental laws, States and localities have amended their laws, regulations, land use plans, policies and BMPs to help protect ESA-listed species and their habitats. In addition, some private landholders have entered into habitat conservation plans (HCPs) designed to improve habitat for listed species, although HCPs have often proven to be costly, difficult and time-consuming to negotiate. Still other private landholders have been encouraged by the ESA to engage in land sales and exchanges to bring important habitat into conservation easements, non-profit ownership, or public ownership. the clean air act The Clean Air Act\ \ directs the Environmental Protection Agency to establish air quality standards protective of public health and welfare. States, in turn, develop plans and programs to achieve those standards. The direct impact of these plans and programs on forest management activities is to limit slash burning and prescribed fires. Indirect impacts include the demand for fuel wood in homes and other facilities. Finally, the motor vehicles and equipment used in forestry must be compliant with all applicable air quality standards. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ The Clean Air Act ( U.S.C. - ) consists of Public Law (July , ; Stat. ) and the amendments made by subsequent enactments. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- the federal insecticide, fungicide and rodenticide act (fifra) The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act,\ \ or FIFRA, establishes comprehensive programs regulating use of pesticides in forestry, agriculture and other situations. Under its provisions, pesticide compounds must be ``registered'' with (approved by) EPA for specific purposes and used only in accordance with EPA-approved ``label'' instructions designed to protect environmental resources. Pesticides which could pose environmental or health hazards if improperly handled or used by untrained people are restricted so they can be purchased and applied only by applicators trained and licensed by state agencies under EPA-approved programs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ U.S.C. et seq. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although FIFRA is applicable to private forest lands, the forestry market for pesticides is relatively small compared to agricultural and urban markets. Because trees grow for long periods compared to food and forage crops, forest-use pesticides usually are applied on particular lands only rarely (e.g. when establishing new plantations or responding to rare pest infestations), in contrast to agriculture, urban lawns, golf courses and other areas where the same chemicals are applied more often. It is not surprising, therefore, that environmental damage from forest-use pesticides has not been documented in the legal or scientific literature as a significant problem. coastal zone management act Unlike the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, Clean Air Act, and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act\ \ directly addresses broader land use issues rather than narrower environmental concerns. Twenty-nine states bordering on the West, East and Gulf Coasts, Pacific Ocean or Great Lakes participate in voluntary federal-state partnerships under the CZMA,\ \ including most major private timber producing states.\ \ These CZMA programs are developed with technical assistance and funding from, and then subject to approval of, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through its Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM). They address a wide range of issues including coastal development, water quality, shoreline erosion, public access, natural resource protection, energy facility siting, and coastal hazards such as hurricanes and flooding.\ \ Other states also address these issues through land use planning laws, local zoning ordinances, etc. Summaries of NOAA-approved CZMA programs are available through a NOAA website.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ Public Law - , U.S.C. - , as amended. \ \ See http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/mystate/welcome.html , a NOAA website containing a map of participating and eligible states and territories. Illinois is the only eligible state currently not participating. \ \ Except Montana, Arkansas, Tennessee, West Virginia and New Hampshire. \ \ See http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/topics/coasts/management/ \ \ At http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/mystate/welcome.html. Click on the map to bring up a summary for a particular state. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- An important component of CZMA programs is the Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program under which states and territories with approved coastal zone management programs must develop and implement programs to control nonpoint source pollution from six main sources including forestry and losses of wetland and riparian areas.\ \ Understandably, there are considerable variations among the states on how forestry issues are addressed in CZMA programs, reflecting differences in state constitutions, agency roles, court decisions, political and economic factors and environmental conditions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ CZMA Sec. ; see also http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/ programs/coast--div.html --------------------------------------------------------------------------- state forestry and land use programs States have adopted a wide variety of regulatory and non-regulatory programs addressing forest-related environmental and land use issues. Generally these are incorporated into federally approved programs under the federal statutes listed above, but many deal with other forestry issues as well. All states have a State Forester, who is responsible for administering forestry programs and coordinating regulatory and non-regulatory programs administered by his department and other agencies.\ \ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ See National Association of State Foresters website, http:// www.stateforesters.org/ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Some states have forest practices acts regulating all or most forest management activities. Some require reforestation after timber harvests. Some require local government approval to convert forestlands to non-forest uses. Some provide various kinds of tax incentives to encourage forest owners to keep their lands in forests. All states provide landowner education and technical assistance delivered by State Foresters, land grant colleges and universities, and other institutions, often with federal funding through the by U.S. Forest Service state and private forestry programs and Natural Resources Conservation Service extension service programs. Some states have struggled to contend with stakeholders who wish to see stricter regulation of forestry activities, notwithstanding the nearly universal view that greater environmental benefits result when forest owners keep their lands in forests rather than convert them to other uses. If forest owners encounter environmental regulations or environmental litigation risks that make forest management uneconomic, many are often compelled to consider alternative ways to obtain economic returns from their property. The problem is compounded by the fact that most forestry investments are ``sunk'' at or near the beginning of a forest stand rotation while most of the economic return is received decades later when the stand is harvested. Therefore, willingness to invest in new forest stands can depend on perceptions about whether harvest will be allowed decades later and what costs might be imposed by regulatory programs at that time. Many states have addressed this dilemma by trying to keep both administrative ``transaction'' costs and operational costs of forest regulation reasonable, relying on landowner education and voluntary cooperation as much as possible, providing technical assistance on forestry issues, favorable tax treatment for forestlands and forestry activities, and other incentives to encourage owners to increase forestry investments and keep lands in forest use. This incentive-based approach has sometimes been criticized by those seeking more regulatory mechanisms, but overall it seems to have produced good results: The amounts of forestland have been gradually increasing in most states for about years as forests have grown back on former farmlands and pasture lands at faster rates than forestlands have been lost to urban development and other non-forest uses. For example, in some New England states land uses have shifted from about % agriculture to about % forests over the last years or so. Similarly in southern states many lands formerly used for grazing, tobacco, cotton or other agricultural uses have returned to forests. In most regions the volumes of standing timber and other biomass have been increasing and could increase further if landowners could be induced to increase forestry investments to enhance timber growth and thus increase their forestry-based economic returns. voluntary cooperative activities In addition to the regulatory and non regulatory approaches listed above, some innovative cooperative projects between private landowners, states, and private foundations have resulted in the protection of critically important natural ecosystems and the interests of private landowners and other stakeholders. Here are a few recent notable examples: In , the Nature Conservancy, the Lyme Timber Company, Conservation Forestry LLC and the State of Tennessee completed the largest conservation transaction in Tennessee since the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the s, protecting nearly , acres of hardwood forests, mountains and streams on the Cumberland Plateau, through a combination of working forest agreements, conservation easements, and land purchases. In , Plum Creek Timber Company and King County, Washington entered into an agreement to protect the Green River Watershed by granting the county a conservation easement at no cost to the taxpayer, in exchange for Development Credits that allowed for increased development density in urban areas. In , Forest Capital Partners signed an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources that will restrict development on more than , acres of their privately owned forestland in Itasca and Koochiching counties in Minnesota. State and private money was used to purchase a working forest conservation easement from Forest Capital Partners, the largest single transaction for conservation in three decades in Minnesota. The terms of the conservation easement, which is in perpetuity, guarantees public access for outdoor recreation, ensures sustainable forest management, and conserves wildlife habitat. In , the Pingree family forest ownership in Maine, in partnership with the New England Forestry Foundation, created the world's largest conservation easement ( , acres) designed to maintain this land in an undeveloped condition while promoting continued use of the acreage as a working forest. These kinds of creative arrangements--employed alongside the methods already available to the federal, state and local governments to regulate, manage, or influence activities on private forests through direct regulation, regulatory and non-regulatory BMPs, land use planning, and incentive arrangements--constitute a rich set of tools that can be used in pursuit of national goals, while remaining responsive to local needs and interests. will an increased demand for energy biomass require changes in forest management regulation? As a result of the growing dependence of the United States of foreign oil and the desire to increase the supply of renewable energy sources, working forests have been increasingly viewed as an important potential source of wood and biomass for conversion into electricity or liquid fuels such as cellulosic ethanol. Some have expressed concern that a ``biomass boom'' might result in the wholesale conversion of working forests into plantations of short rotation woody crops for the exclusive purpose of energy production, resulting in a loss of wood supply for saw logs, wood chips for pulp, or other forest products. Still others have expressed concerns that such a conversion might result in a loss of some of the environmental benefits that working forests provide. It is important to note the forest products industry is already a major producer and user of renewable electricity, and that biomass already produces roughly % of the nation's non-hydro renewable electricity.\ \ Forest landowners have harvested biomass for energy in some locations for more than years. In many instances, forest management that includes biomass harvesting has been included in BMP audits and third party certification programs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ \ U.S. EIA at www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/alternate/page/ renew_energy_consump/table .html--Biomass is the primary energy source for . billion kilowatt hours of the billion kilowatt hours of non-hydro renewable energy produced in (preliminary figures, subject to revision). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Market history also suggests that wholesale conversion of working forests to dedicated energy crops is unlikely, since biomass intended to be used as an energy feedstock generally has a lower market value than other forest products. While wholesale conversion may be a valid concern in the case of ``row crop'' agriculture, where native grasslands, lands set aside for conservation purposes, or lands in food production might be converted to dedicated energy crops, such is not the case for working forests where energy biomass removals are likely to be in addition to, not in lieu of, the existing production of higher value products. But there probably are opportunities for working forests to be managed, in the pursuit of higher value products, to produce increasing amounts of biomass for renewable energy production. To ensure that soil productivity, wildlife habitat, or other values are not compromised by the removal of additional material that would otherwise be left in the forest without an ancillary market for biomass energy feedstocks, some states are exploring approaches to revise existing BMPs, or to establish new guidelines in addition to existing BMPs, to guide in the harvest of biomass for large scale energy. Because BMPs or the development of other BMP-like guidelines can take local factors into account, it seems prudent that enhancements or adjustments to state practices and guidelines be considered without federal interference, particularly as we gain a greater understanding of how biomass conversion technologies and markets will actually evolve. With respect to the other potential impacts of increased forest biomass utilization for energy on air and water quality, wildlife habitat, and pesticide use, it is difficult to speculate beyond broad generalizations. However, the removal of additional biomass could be beneficial to air quality to the extent that it reduces the need for prescribed burns, lowers the risk of catastrophic wildfire or displaces fossil fuels as an energy source. Water quality would arguably be unchanged, since the largest factor in non-point source pollution associated with forest operations involves the construction and placement of roads, and biomass collection would likely occur using the same roads and access points used for the higher value product harvests. Increased use of wood for renewable electric power generation is unlikely to occur to the detriment of ESA-listed species since most wood-based biofuels have been and probably will continue to be byproducts of timber harvests conducted primarily for production of lumber, pulp, paper and other traditional forest products. Increased use of wood for renewable energy could contribute to increased pesticide use in some intensively managed plantations, mainly at the time new crops are being established. However, healthy fast-growing intensively managed timber crops are seldom subject to the kinds of insect and disease problems that sometimes require use of insecticides in ``overmature'' timber stands or other stands containing large amounts of dead, dying or damaged trees that attract forest pests. Therefore increased use of wood-based biomass seems unlikely to generate widespread pesticide problems or increased use of pesticides in the forestry sector. conclusion A robust yet flexible array of tools, in the form of federal, state and local laws, regulations, programs and Best Management Practices have measurably improved the environmental performance of forest operations in the United States. In addition, voluntary activities and third party sustainability programs have worked to promote environmental goals without sacrificing jobs and economic activity. As policymakers consider the imposition of new environmental requirements on private working forests, or market limitations on the participation of private working forests in emerging renewable energy markets, the implications for the economic viability of working forests must be considered to avoid inviting an unintended result--compelling private forest owners to consider alternative uses for working forests that do not provide the environmental services that provide healthy watersheds, wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration and similar benefits that are highly valued by society. ______ Statement of the American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA) introduction The American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA) appreciates this opportunity to comment on the proposal to implement a national Renewable Electricity Standard (RES). AF&PA is the national trade association of the forest products industry, representing pulp, paper, packaging and wood products manufacturers, and forest landowners. Our companies make products essential for everyday life from renewable and recyclable resources that sustain the environment. The forest products industry accounts for approximately percent of the total U.S. manufacturing GDP, putting it on par with the automotive a nd plastics industries. Industry companies produce $ billion in products annually and employ more than million people earning $ billion in annual payroll. The industry is among the top manufacturing sector employers in states. The forest products industry is the leading producer and user of renewable biomass energy. In fact, the energy we produce from biomass exceeds the total energy produced from solar, wind, and geothermal sources combined. Sixty-five percent of the energy used at AF&PA member paper and wood products facilities is generated from carbon-neutral renewable biomass. The industry also is a leader in highly efficient cogeneration of electric power, much of it from biomass, both for internal use and for sale to the power grid. Since , all AF&PA members must subscribe to the principles of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), an independent forest certification system with rigorous standards that are developed by a multi-stakeholder board representing conservation groups and research organizations as well as forest landowners and manufacturers. With over program participants and million acres of certified well managed forests, the SFI program demonstrates that America's forest and paper companies are committed to sustainable forest management. Our historic commitment to renewable energy and sustainable forest management demonstrates that a balance between the two is both possible and necessary. af&pa position While AF&PA supports the goals of a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES), we oppose a federal RES that does not provide equal treatment to the forest products industry's existing renewable energy generation with new generation, applies a onesize-fits-all approach, and which would burden the industry with increased costs for energy and its raw materials. In order to potentially address some of these concerns, if a federal RES is enacted, it should: Treat Energy from Existing and New Facilities Equally The forest products industry is an unmatched leader when it comes to the generation of renewable biomass energy, and meets an average of percent of its energy needs from carbon-neutral renewable biomass. Any RES should recognize this leadership and investment by treating biomass-based electricity from existing industry facilities equally with electricity from new facilities. There are currently states (including the District of Colombia) that have RES mandates or goals. Twenty-five of them allow power from existing facilities to qualify. As discussed below, an RES should acknowledge and promote the leadership of the states in making their determinations of qualifying power and also allow power from existing facilities to qualify. The committee's proposed RES legislation would not provide tradeable credits for the renewable electricity generated by our manufacturing facilities. AF&PA believes the RES should be amended to fully recognize the renewable, carbon-neutral power generated by our manufacturing facilities, as it displaces fossil-fuel and helps to achieve the objectives of the RES. As the demand for biomass-based power increases, AF&PA member facilities must compete with new market entrants for that biomass--the raw material for their products, as well as the source of their own renewable, carbon-neutral power. The ability of new market entrants' electricity to qualify for, and generate revenue from, renewable energy credits (RECs), while existing facilities' biomass-based electricity does not qualify, puts existing facilities at a serious competitive disadvantage. Moreover, utilities complying with an RES typically are able to pass through their compliance costs in the form of a state public utilities commission approved rate increases to their customers (including AF&PA members, who are large ratepayers). Accordingly, regulated utilities can pay more for the wood biomass they purchase. In contrast, the forest products industry operates in a highly competitive global market in which manufacturers cannot pass on higher raw material and energy costs to consumers and still remain competitive. Forest products manufacturing facilities are major customers of utilities. No one benefits if a policy compels those customers to compete against their energy suppliers on a playing field that is so uneven that the customers' survival is jeopardized. Since , the housing crisis and the economic downturn have brought about the loss of percent of the industry's workforce--about , jobs. These jobs are critical for the survival of the rural communities where our facilities often are located. Finally, AF&PA supports provisions allowing energy efficiency to qualify as a resource to help a utility qualify under the RES. The proposed percentages of renewable power are extremely ambitious, and every source of possible clean energy will be needed to achieve the RES goals. The bill allows states to petition for energy efficiency (such as electricity savings from combined heat and power) to meet a portion of RES mandate. However, the bill only allows the output of a new combined heat and power system to qualify for energy efficiency credits, thereby putting our existing combined heat and power systems at a disadvantage as compared to new facilities. Provide Incentives for Reliable and Affordable Regional Fiber Supplies and Promote Sustainable Forest Management Renewable energy and climate change policies are projected to substantially increase demand on wood biomass as a source of bioenergy. Projections released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in December of indicate that biomassbased power generation by the electric power sector will increase from . billion kWh in to . billion kWh in . Wood is a renewable resource that differs from wind and solar power in that is has other uses and demands from existing sources. The combined impacts of the federal RES, state RES programs, the existing Renewable Fuel Standard, the cellulosic ethanol production tax credit, climate change policies, and Federal government support for new facilities to process wood biomass into energy have created concerns about the reliability and availability of fiber supplies in certain regions of the country. Without efforts to increase overall biomass supply, the increase in demand for wood biomass for electricity will likely have unintended consequences on forest products manufacturing facilities that rely on woody biomass as their key raw material and energy source. While intensified management and research can increase forest productivity, incentives should be provided for programs that promote the planting of biomass feedstocks, including trees and short rotation woody crops, on farm lands, planted forestlands or degraded forestlands, and investment in biomass collection. In addition, biomass from Federal public lands should also be included as eligible biomass. Increasing the supply of biomass can help prevent displacement of existing manufacturing-based green jobs in rural communities. Recognize State Leadership in Renewable Energy As stated above, thirty-five states (including Washington, D.C.), have proactively adopted RES mandates or goals. Each state RES program is the result of the state's legislative process, ballot initiative or executive order and is carefully tailored to maximize efficiency and minimize cost, based on local political realities, economic conditions and resource availability. Imposition of a federal RES that does not recognize these program standards could unnecessarily increase costs and impose needless economic hardship that state programs are designed to avoid and thereby undermine public support for RES programs. State RES programs include critical provisions on definitions of qualifying resources and the required percentages of renewable energy and their associated deadlines, among others. A federal RES should not require states to revise their programs to be consistent with the federal program. This would require the unnecessary expenditure of resources to reconfigure programs already achieving progress on renewable energy, severely disrupting program implementation and hindering achievement of their goals. Any federal legislation should ensure that investments made and progress realized under any state RES programs are preserved and permitted to qualify on a goingforward basis. We appreciate the provisions in the bill that attempt to harmonize the federal and state programs, but it does not appear those provisions achieve this goal. The states should be provided with mechanism, similar to that in the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), which would allow a state to obtain a waiver from the RES if the Secretary of Energy makes certain determinations regarding economic or environmental impacts of RES implementation or the adequacy of the supply of renewable energy in the state or region. AF&PA appreciates the opportunity to offer our views on the proposed federal Renewable Electricity Standard. We look forward to working with the committee in coming weeks to address the issues raised in our statement. ______ Free Flow Power, Gloucester, MA, February , . Hon. Jeff Bingaman, Chairman, Hon. Lisa Murkowski, Ranking Member, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Dirksen Senate Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski, and Members of the Committee: Free Flow Power Corporation (FFP) is pleased to present these comments for the record of the Committee's Hearing on the Renewable Electricity Standard (RES). FFP applauds the Committee for advancing the discussion of a national RES, which FFP wholeheartedly supports. If enacted, the majority staff draft circulated by the Committee would be a landmark step in the development of the United States' renewable energy economy. However, without amendment of the term ``ocean energy'' in Section (a)( ) of the draft, the RES legislation would inadvertently exclude hydrokinetic energy generated from rivers, this country's best hydrokinetic resource. By amending the term to ``marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy,'' as defined in the Tax Code ( U.S.C. Sec. ), the Committee will ensure that all potential sources of clean, renewable energy are recognized. FFP is a renewable energy company focused on hydrokinetic generation. Hydrokinetic generation uses tides, currents, waves, and free flowing rivers to produce electricity without building dams or diversions. FFP has developed a suite of proprietary turbine generator technologies and is obtaining regulatory approvals to develop over hydrokinetic sites on the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers. FFP has offices in Massachusetts, Louisiana, and Washington and is developing projects in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana. Globally, the hydrokinetic energy developers have focused primarily on ocean tides and currents, and the language of the draft RES bill reflects this attention. However, areas of high tidal energy are less plentiful in the United States than in other areas of the world, such as the British Isles, where several leading hydrokinetic companies are currently based. FFP is committed to developing its business in the United States and therefore has focused on in-stream hydrokinetics, harnessing the flows of America's rivers. Detailed analysis of over , potential hydrokinetic sites in the United States led FFP to concentrate on the Mississippi River Basin, which drains % of the continent and is the third largest river system in the world. FFP is convinced that developing hydrokinetic sites in rivers provides a faster path to commercialization than starting with oceans, due to several advantages for river-based deployment. Fresh water is less corrosive and less susceptible to bio-fouling than salt water. River sites are generally closer to end users of electricity than ocean sites, dramatically reducing the costs associated with expensive underwater cabling. The uni-directional flows found in rivers are much easier to engineer than bi-directional tidal flows, which range from zero to maximum capacity. The environmental issues in rivers have been studied extensively over time and are much better understood than ocean environments. The Mississippi River is an especially strong hydrokinetic resource because, unlike the other major river systems in the world, the energy of the Mississippi is focused through a fixed channel and levee system rather than being allowed to dissipate across a flood plain. FFP supports the development of wind, solar, and other renewable energy resources, all of which are essential to building a diversified renewable energy portfolio. FFP believes that development of hydrokinetic energy in rivers in the United States must also be a component of a diverse renewable energy portfolio that includes wind, solar, and other renewable energy resources. Hydrokinetic energy generation requires no building of dams or diversions, eliminating the environmental concerns that have caused the decline in conventional hydropower generation over the past half-century. The advantages of hydrokinetic generation are many Hydrokinetic energy facilities are ideal in areas where wind and solar resources are marginal, such as the Mississippi River Basin. Hydrokinetic sites are located primarily underwater and therefore have less visual impact than wind or solar. Hydrokinetic energy provides reliable energy output that can be predicted with precision days or weeks in advance. FFP believes that it can develop most of its hydrokinetic projects at a capital cost that is competitive with coal and less expensive than many other renewable energy resources, while creating robust operations and maintenance businesses that will employ thousands of American workers in jobs close to their homes. FFP supports the inclusion of hydrokinetic energy resources in the draft RES bill and strongly urges the Commission to amend the language ``ocean energy'' at Section (a)( ) to include all categories of hydrokinetic resources, including river-based projects. FFP recommends implementation of the comprehensive term ``marine and hydrokinetic energy,'' which was passed by the Senate and House in the American Economic Stabilization Act of (H.R. ) last summer. ``Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy'' is defined in the Tax Code, U.S.C. Sec. , as follows: (A) In General.--The term ``marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy'' means energy derived from---- (i) waves, tides, and currents in oceans, estuaries, and tidal areas, (ii) free flowing water in rivers, lakes, and streams, (iii) free flowing water in an irrigation system, canal, or other man-made channel, including projects that utilize non-mechanical structures to accelerate the flow of water for electric power production purposes, or (iv) differentials in ocean temperature (ocean thermal energy conversion). (B) Exceptions.--Such term shall not include any energy which is derived from any source which utilizes a dam, diversionary structure (except as provided in subparagraph (A)(iii)), or impoundment for electric power production purposes. Adoption of the term ``marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy'' will ensure that clean, renewable energy that is generated from the United States' best hydrokinetic resource--its rivers--will be available to satisfy the requirements of the national RES. The availability of all sources of hydrokinetic energy is essential to ensure equality for electricity consumers in states without ocean resources or other viable sources of renewable energy. Thank you for your consideration of these comments. Respectfully submitted, Daniel R. Irvin, President and CEO. ______ State of New Jersey, Board of Public Utilities, Newark, NJ, February , . Hon. Jeff Bingaman, Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Dirksen Senate Building, Washington, DC . Re: Comments on Proposed RES Legislation Dear Chairman Bingaman: The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) respectfully submits written testimony on the Democratic staff draft for Chairman Bingaman's Renewable Electricity Standard in the context of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee hearing being held on Tuesday, February , . We applaud your commitment to establish a federal Renewable Energy Standard (RES) and the goals reflected in the recent draft RPS legislation released by Senator Bingaman (January, Discussion Draft). We also appreciate your concern about the potential impact that a federal RES may have on the existing State Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). We would like to take this opportunity to comment on a few key issues, critical to the effective interaction between state RPS programs and a new federal RES. New Jersey was one of the first States in the nation to implement an RPS and is widely recognized for its effective rules and standards that have helped advance renewable energy markets. Governor Corzine recently announced plans to increase New Jersey's RPS from . % Renewable Energy by to % renewable energy by --a goal that exceeds the proposed federal RES. In the year ending May , , over . million MWhs of Class I Renewable Energy was generated to meet New Jersey's RPS which represents approximately $ million in renewable energy certificate (REC) sales, supporting countless jobs and economic benefits for the State and region. Early movers like New Jersey have served as a laboratory of effective market design that have helped states and governments develop renewable energy programs that work across regions, electric grids and electric power markets. New Jersey was one of the first States to adopt the use of RECs to demonstrate compliance with our State RPS and provide market-based incentives to renewable energy generators based on REC value. As part of this initiative New Jersey also help finance and establish the PJM-Generator Attribute Tracking System (GATs) to track and verify RECs. While we are excited by the opportunity that a federal RES represents in terms of market growth and additional stimulus, we are also deeply concerned that a federal RES could significantly disrupt renewable energy markets in states like New Jersey and REC markets in particular. The enclosed document ``Observations on State and Federal Interaction with respect to Renewable Portfolio Standards'', January, , developed by Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA), a multi-state RPS collaborative, provides more detailed recommendations that we hope you will consider as you advance federal RES legislation. Of particular concern to New Jersey however, are the following issues regarding the appropriate and effective interaction between state and federal RPS programs which we would like to bring to your attention: . State Preemption.--While the current draft legislation explicitly disavows state preemption, the language is general and other provisions of the bill could frustrate the ability of states to achieve higher targets such as those set by New Jersey. A federal RPS should contain comprehensive language to prevent both express and implied preemption of the existing state RPS laws and explicitly allow states to enact RPS requirements that differ from the federal requirement, particularly resource specific requirements such as a carve- out, set-aside or a multiplier. Resource specific carve-outs and multipliers, such as New Jersey's solar set aside, have been critical to the growth of important renewable energy resources, such as solar technology and customer-sited resources, that can not at present compete against the lowest cost resources or that face other market barriers. However, these higher cost renewables provide substantial public and energy values, and will experience significant future cost reductions as markets mature with the assistance of RPS programs across the country. A federal RES should also require that any renewable energy credits used to meet a state RPS that are in excess of the federal requirement must be retired rather than sold to utilities in other states or banked for future federal compliance. A federal RES should also prohibit state- specific RECs that do not meet the federal RPS from use for federal compliance. . REC Tracking System Integration.--The proposed legislation appears to envision a separate federal REC tracking system that operates in parallel to state or regional REC systems. This dual REC system could add considerable complexity, cause problems with clear title and existing contracts, and risk potential double counting thus undermining New Jersey and other state REC markets. We strongly recommend that a federal RES rely on the network of existing and emerging state or regional tracking systems, such as PJM-GATs, to issue, track and retire renewable energy credits and energy efficiency credits. PJM is the Independent System Operator (ISO) that coordinates and directs the operation of the region's transmission grid; administers a competitive wholesale electricity market, the world's largest; and plans regional transmission expansion improvements to maintain grid reliability and relieve congestion.--PJM-GATs, which was launched in September , tracks and verifies RECs within the PJM Interconnection control area serving million people in all or parts of Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. PJM-GATS was established in response to the needs of state regulatory commissions, other state agencies and market participants for a single, regional, integrated system to implement stateimposed fuel mix and emissions disclosure requirements and renewable portfolio standards. The states and PJM Interconnection market participants believe this integrated system is the most cost- effective approach to serve the public policy and regulatory needs. It provides the greatest accuracy and efficient tracking of the ownership of the attributes. We believe that a federal RPS tracking system should be required to consult with and rely on such existing tracking systems. The federal RES should also require DOE to reinforce minimum design and operational requirements to support a fully functional national credit trading market for renewable energy credits and energy efficiency credits. Where tracking capability does not exist, the DOE through the federal RES, can create, or delegate authority to create, one or more regional tracking systems. . National REC Definition.--While the proposed legislation defines what resources are eligible for receiving federal RECs, it does not define clearly what a REC and its associated attributes are. Federal legislation should provide a simple, standard definition for RECs that can lay the foundation for well coordinated markets. RECs will be fungible for national RES compliance and support a liquid market only if they have a clear and common definition. A federal RES should use the most universal definition of a REC, based on a unit of production, i.e. MWh = REC, with no derived attributes such as emission credits or allowances. States should also be allowed to retain specific authority to determine how and under what conditions electricity suppliers may purchase, transfer, trade, or retire any RECs or environmental attributes associated with renewable generation used to meet a state RPS. . Alternative Compliance Payments.--Most federal RES proposals have included an alternative compliance payment mechanism (ACP). Because state ACP and noncompliance penalties are so diverse, we recommend that state ACP/penalties do not count towards the federal RES. Because state use of ACP/penalty payments cannot be readily or directly linked to actual renewable generation, counting state ACP or penalty payments towards a federal RPS is not practical. In our view, all options that provide federal compliance credit for state ACP/ penalties are problematic, regardless of design. The proposed legislation also states that revenue from alternative compliance payments and penalties under the federal RPS should be granted to state agencies responsible for developing state energy conservation programs (i.e., state energy offices) to be used for energy conservation and renewable energy development. The bill provides funding preference for those states which have limited renewable energy capacity and for state programs that promote ``innovative'' renewable energy technologies. New Jersey is one of more than states who administer a renewable energy fund that has proven highly effective in support of renewable energy project deployment and energy efficiency programs, with funding coming in part from state RPS alternative compliance payments. We strongly recommend that revenues generated by any federal ACP and penalty payments should be provided to states on a purely non-discretionary basis through a formula that allocates these monies back to the state where the compliance payments originated. New Jersey would consider the reallocation of these funds to other states a serious loss of funds that are currently being used to support New Jersey based resources, in particular New Jersey solar. The funds should be provided to the states for use in providing financial assistance to renewable energy projects, as is the common practice among state RPS programs. To do otherwise could seriously undermine public support for RES and weaken existing state clean energy programs. Also, the preference for use of these funds should be for supporting all renewable technologies, both mature and emerging, rather than targeted to only innovative technologies. As Congress discusses the merits and design of a federal RES, we strongly recommend that a federal program be designed to complement and coordinate with New Jersey and other state programs to the extent practicable. We would welcome the opportunity to work with your staff and other stakeholders to provide additional input and to review draft legislation. Sincerely yours, Jeanne M. Fox, President. ______ Statement of Paul N. Cicio, President, the Industrial Energy Consumers of America Renewable energy has an important place within the U.S. energy mix and should be expanded along with other domestic sources of energy. Importantly, the Industrial Energy Consumers of America (IECA) believes any decision to mandate renewable energy supplies should be left to each state--not the federal government. Each state has significantly differing renewable resource supply profiles, electric transmission and distribution capacity and associated costs that must be considered. Expanding use of renewable energy will significantly increase the cost of electricity in a time when the public and the manufacturing sector cannot afford increased costs. In general, renewable energy is our most expensive source of electricity when the total costs of production, the federal subsidy, increased cost of transmission, distribution and backup generation costs are combined. As such, we are concerned that an aggressive increase in the renewable energy share of the total power generation market will raise the cost of electricity to the manufacturing sector. Higher costs directly impact our competitiveness. Sound U.S. energy policy demands more than simply an increase in the supply of renewable energy. It must be globally cost-competitive and reliable in supply. Why? First, because the manufacturing sector competes globally with companies whose energy costs are often lower and sometimes subsidized by governments. (China is a good example.) And, when manufacturing successfully competes globally it creates domestic high paying jobs with benefits and exports that are critical to our country's economic recovery. Secondly, because manufacturing facilities must have an instantaneous supply of electricity--not an intermittent supply, to operate a variety of diverse and complex processes, some of which that operate / . If Congress intends to pass an RES, it must lower the cost of the resulting delivery of electricity. The best way to accomplish that is to allow ``energy efficiency and waste energy projects'' to compete head to head with renewable energy sources. Competition between renewable energy and energy efficiency/waste energy will help drive down the cost of the delivered electricity. Every home owner, farmer and manufacturer will benefit. The market--not the Congress should determine winners and losers by letting renewable energy and energy efficiency/waste energy compete head to head. In many ways, energy efficiency/waste energy is better than renewable energy because it is delivering clean lower cost energy into the market that is more reliable . . . and less intermittent like wind and solar. Unfortunately, renewable energy is our most expensive form of electricity. Non-hydro renewable energy is % more expensive than nuclear and % more expensive than coal based electricity according to the US Department of Energy, data. Cost of Electricity ($/MWH) Non-Hydro Renewable: $ . Natural Gas: $ . Nuclear: $ . Coal: $ . An important unintended consequence of a federal RES mandate is the loss of competitiveness of the pulp and paper industry that uses biomass as a feedstock. The federal RES creates competition for the finite source of biomass in a regional area and could render paper mills in that region non-competitive creating additional loss of jobs. "
